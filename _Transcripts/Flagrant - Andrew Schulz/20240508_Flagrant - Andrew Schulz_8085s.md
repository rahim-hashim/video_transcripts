*  And Gronk goes, oh man, you know, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=84.8s)]
*  sometimes you just get bored, you know? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=86.82s)]

*  you're sitting in your apartment, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  you're in your apartment for eight days, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=90.96s)]
*  you're not doing anything. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=92.5s)]
*  You just want to fucking kill yourself. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=94.0s)]
*  This is before the roast has even started. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=95.39999999999999s)]

*  I can't do this right now. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=113.22s)]
*  You probably love the roast being called a retard [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=114.78s)]
*  because he felt something. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=116.88s)]
*  He felt something. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=117.98s)]
*  That shit was getting to him, bro. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=121.08s)]
*  Did you think? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=122.67999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=123.52s)]
*  He was like, in the beginning, he was like, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=124.52s)]
*  okay, first couple people shot at me, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=125.92s)]
*  and then eventually he's like, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=127.72s)]
*  why do they keep making the same jokes about me? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=129.02s)]
*  Like, I don't think it's okay. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=131.82s)]
*  There are so many things like behind the scenes [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=133.46s)]
*  that I want to tell you guys about. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=135.16s)]
*  Like, first of all, you know when Gronk [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=136.76s)]
*  spiked the shot glass? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=138.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=139.7s)]
*  That had to hit him. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=140.6s)]
*  Real shot glass. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=141.5s)]
*  Yeah, he was not supposed to do this. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=142.5s)]
*  He was supposed to do this right before I go up. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=143.68s)]
*  He spiked it, but he's one of those where like, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=145.18s)]
*  the closest thing I can say is there is a video [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=147.26s)]
*  of a kid with Down syndrome that is dressed up [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=150.85999999999999s)]
*  as Stone Cold Steve Austin, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=153.29999999999998s)]
*  and he walks up to his pool and he takes the Bud Lights, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=155.06s)]
*  he smashes them together, and he starts to drink out them [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=157.76s)]
*  as the Bud Lights have already been leaked [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=160.5s)]
*  because the glass is broke, right? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=162.04s)]
*  That was Gronk. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=163.98s)]
*  He took the shot. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=165.04s)]
*  He wasn't even included in it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=166.04s)]
*  The shot was about Tom Brady, Belichick, and Bob Kraft. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=167.74s)]
*  And he's just there. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=171.12s)]
*  And he takes it, and he has so much energy, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=172.46s)]
*  he doesn't know what to do, he slams it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=174.6s)]
*  All of us are like, what the fuck just happened? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=177.79999999999998s)]
*  A girl in the front row has like a piece of shot glass [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=180.2s)]
*  like hanging out of her chair. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=182.84s)]
*  Like, and I'm not talking about a little thing flicked. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=185.14s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  Whole cheek is red. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=187.92s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=189.72s)]
*  She looks like a mime. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=190.42s)]
*  I have to go up afterwards. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=192.38s)]
*  So I'm just like, all right, what's the witty joke? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=194.57999999999998s)]
*  Like, I'm like, how am I gonna, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=198.16s)]
*  it's not the first time Gronk spiked a drink. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=199.32s)]
*  And I'm like, what can I acknowledge the moment? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=201.98000000000002s)]
*  And shout out to Kevin Hart, bro. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=204.96s)]
*  This guy is like, son. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=208.62s)]
*  First of all, he's amazing, but like what he did, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=212.46s)]
*  like hosts will do this in a comedy show. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=214.96s)]
*  Like if something crazy happens, they'll reset the room, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=216.5s)]
*  bring the energy back down, bring it back down. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=219.14000000000001s)]
*  He took time. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=222.14000000000001s)]
*  He calmed the room back down. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=225.04000000000002s)]
*  Didn't even joke around about it, just kind of like, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=226.74s)]
*  what is going on here? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=228.34s)]

*  I peed three times. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=247.68s)]
*  He didn't get to pee once. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=248.72s)]
*  Like, within 30 minutes of being up there, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=250.38s)]
*  I was like, I ain't making it. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=252.56s)]
*  You had that Akash Singh. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=253.42000000000002s)]
*  Son, I was thinking about you the whole time. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=254.46s)]
*  The second he brought that TV screen out for Bert and Tom, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=257.22s)]
*  I saw a couple of football players leave [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=260.7s)]
*  and I was like, I'm out of this place. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=262.7s)]
*  No disrespect Bert and Tom, but I got a fucking pee. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=264.6s)]
*  Left, apparently there's a shot of me walking back. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  That's the best point. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=272.0s)]
*  That's the point. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=273.0s)]
*  I pulled the clock. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=275.78000000000003s)]
*  I was like, hey, can they see me? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=276.78000000000003s)]
*  Directly in front of the camera. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=282.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=283.68s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=284.68s)]
*  But you did great. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=285.92s)]
*  Oh, thank you, man. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=287.68s)]
*  You did fucking great. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=288.68s)]
*  The jokes were fire. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=289.58s)]
*  Unreal. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=290.62s)]
*  I love the moments where you stepped out of the joke. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=291.62s)]
*  Because I know that probably the instinct, I assume, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=293.78s)]
*  is just do the jokes and you're so fucking nervous. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=296.21999999999997s)]
*  That's all you do. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=299.26s)]
*  But when you were like, Jeff, there's no kids back there. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=300.35999999999996s)]
*  That was great. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=302.3s)]
*  And then the Cav shit, Cav with Puff, Cav, that's your boy. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=303.36s)]
*  Fire. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=307.44s)]
*  That's fun. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=308.7s)]
*  It's funny you say that because that was the thing [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=309.7s)]
*  that I found most tricky about this, which is like, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=312.24s)]
*  how do you, it's not even stay in the moment, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=314.9s)]
*  but be in the moment from the beginning. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=318.8s)]
*  And I was like, OK, do I not, I want to just go, hey, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=321.48s)]
*  we're in the moment here. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=324.84000000000003s)]
*  And then do the set instead of being like, here are the jokes. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=326.52s)]
*  But at the same time, we're also like three hours [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=329.44s)]
*  into this fucking thing. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=331.28000000000003s)]
*  And to a live telecast. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=332.08s)]
*  So it's like, OK, what can I do? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=333.48s)]
*  But yeah, those moments are good. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=335.36s)]
*  Fucking shout out, Nikki Glaser, absolutely demolished. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=336.76s)]
*  She's my secret. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=339.6s)]
*  I was blown away. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=343.0s)]
*  She was so fucking good. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=344.0s)]
*  The pacing, the rhythm was perfect. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=345.16s)]
*  And then Tony, holy fuck. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=347.38s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=349.82s)]
*  They just, they were just so fucking good. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=350.82s)]
*  Like if you haven't seen it yet, it is worth it to watch them. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=353.82s)]
*  Like they just were just masterful. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=357.40000000000003s)]
*  It was great. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=359.94s)]
*  And that blood so was good. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=360.54s)]
*  So here's the thing. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=361.90000000000003s)]
*  He's surprising. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=362.84000000000003s)]
*  What makes or breaks a roast is not the comedians. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=363.90000000000003s)]
*  The non-comedians? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=366.6s)]
*  If the non-comedians deliver, it's a good roast. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=368.04s)]
*  Oh, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=371.34000000000003s)]
*  Non-comedian, Edelman. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=372.72s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=374.92s)]
*  So here's the thing. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=375.88s)]
*  They took it serious. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=376.88s)]
*  Edelman was working it out at the Comedy Store. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=377.84s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=379.98s)]
*  Like Drew Bledsoe hit me up afterwards. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=380.98s)]
*  He's like, dude, we were watching a lot of your stuff [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=382.98s)]
*  and some other guys. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=385.82s)]
*  Like they were actually studying it. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=386.71999999999997s)]
*  Like game film. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=387.82s)]
*  All that. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=388.62s)]
*  They had to get out of it. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=389.21999999999997s)]
*  Awesome. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=389.86s)]
*  But I think that's what happens when you get athletes. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=390.86s)]
*  They're like, oh, the way to be good at something [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=391.96s)]
*  is to repeat it over and over again [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=394.36s)]
*  and watch people that are good at it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=396.3s)]
*  Practice and prepare, and they can be good. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=397.76s)]
*  And after watching Gronk, I believe [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=399.5s)]
*  he never watched game film. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=400.94s)]
*  I believe that about him. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=402.8s)]
*  His joke where he's like, oh, Gronk, touchdown. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=403.9s)]
*  Oh, Gronk, why won't you do the touchdown? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=406.9s)]
*  That was personal. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=408.68s)]
*  That was Dotton Lamar. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=409.88s)]
*  I mean, Dotton Drake. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=411.58s)]
*  Fuck y'all. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=414.28s)]
*  So when he went off script, I wrote that one. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=415.28s)]
*  I just wrote that one. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=417.62s)]
*  Gronk Dotton. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=419.12s)]
*  Can I tell you something? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=420.12s)]
*  That's in the prompter. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=421.42s)]
*  He's like, no. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=422.92s)]
*  No. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=424.15999999999997s)]
*  Like I'm reading the prompter, and the prompter [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=426.26s)]
*  is written in retard, right? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=429.36s)]
*  It's like, at one point, that one was creative. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=431.15999999999997s)]
*  See, I'm creative. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=433.84s)]
*  No way. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=434.94s)]
*  No. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=436.24s)]
*  The one thing that he did, or a few things he ad-libbed, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=437.44s)]
*  one is when he's like, Kevin, I'll make you suck my dick. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=439.64s)]
*  And all of us were like, OK, he's gone. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=445.88s)]
*  He's fucking gone. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=448.68s)]
*  He got excited by the crowd, and he's out of here. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=450.68s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=453.18s)]
*  Oh, it's probably great sitting next to Bert there. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=454.38s)]
*  I don't know who he's in the other side. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=455.92s)]
*  Was Nicky on the other side? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=456.72s)]
*  No, Sam. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=457.82s)]
*  Sam Jay. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=458.62s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=459.42s)]
*  So you had homies on both sides. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=460.42s)]
*  Sam was great. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=461.16s)]
*  Three hours. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=461.96000000000004s)]
*  Sam did fucking great. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=462.9s)]
*  I was impressed. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=463.7s)]
*  Yeah, it was fun when, it was definitely fun when [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=464.47999999999996s)]
*  Ben Affleck was on, and we were like, what the fuck is this? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=467.02s)]
*  How the fuck are you doing, dude? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=469.35999999999996s)]
*  Dude, JLo broke this man. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=470.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=472.85999999999996s)]
*  Son, son, son, son. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=473.35999999999996s)]
*  So what the fuck is wrong with Ben Affleck? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=474.46s)]
*  He comes up, and everybody's stoked, right? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=476.35999999999996s)]
*  So hype. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=478.73999999999995s)]
*  And because we all love Ben Affleck. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=479.94s)]
*  Ben Affleck's the man. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=481.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=482.4s)]
*  And then he started talking. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=483.4s)]
*  He was defending Tom from internet trolls. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=485.14s)]
*  And like, a few minutes in, I'm like, oh, he ain't even [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=488.73999999999995s)]
*  talking about Tom. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=492.03999999999996s)]
*  No, no, he's not. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=492.82s)]
*  He's not. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=493.52s)]
*  Ben Affleck. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=494.47999999999996s)]
*  He's talking about Batman versus Superman. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=495.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=496.91999999999996s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=498.41999999999996s)]
*  It was personal. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=500.21999999999997s)]
*  Once you saw it, you're like, is this whole thing a proxy [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=501.12s)]
*  for him to just yell at people online? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=504.21999999999997s)]
*  I don't know if he realizes it, but yes. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=506.06s)]
*  That's the other thing. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=507.76s)]
*  He might not. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=508.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=509.23999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=509.73999999999995s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=510.34s)]
*  Yeah, it was crazy. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=511.64s)]
*  Kim Carr, Kardashian was. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=513.24s)]
*  She's a pro. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=515.5799999999999s)]
*  I'll be honest. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=516.4s)]
*  Son. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=516.98s)]
*  She's a pro. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=517.64s)]
*  She is a pro. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=518.24s)]
*  Yeah, she's a pro. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=519.7800000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=520.6800000000001s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=521.46s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=522.3000000000001s)]
*  She's a video pro. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=523.9000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=524.7s)]
*  No, what I would say about Kim is that she's striking. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=526.5600000000001s)]
*  She's like, perfectly symmetrical. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=531.5s)]
*  Like, you look at her and you're like, oh, wow. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=533.44s)]
*  But I've never seen somebody be so disassociated in my life. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=535.6400000000001s)]
*  If somebody told me, hey, it's not really Kim Kardashian. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=544.7800000000001s)]
*  she has this like a robot where she can essentially control like what it says, but it's not like [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=548.12s)]
*  there's no human aspect to it. I get it. Oh, I get it. She's a mentor and can't it. She [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=553.76s)]
*  sat with perfect posture for three hours straight. Right. Smile, laugh like I, I've never seen [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=561.48s)]
*  anything like that. I just completely detached. She grew up with a camera on her 24 seven [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=569.4s)]
*  for the past 15 years. But some people do that and like they go crazy and they're a [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=576.56s)]
*  child star. They're fucking dealing with whatever trauma. OJ was in her fucking room before the [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=580.4s)]
*  Bronco chase like ready to kill himself. Like that's probably to give her some sympathy. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=586.9599999999999s)]
*  That's probably Kim had to look at OJ and be like, Hey, OJ, I can't do that. Yeah. Again, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=591.76s)]
*  I, I, I don't know. I, yeah, I, I, I'm sure she's nice and all the other things. The only [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=598.28s)]
*  thing I, it just looked completely unaffected. Yeah. And even when she was up there, they're [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=604.08s)]
*  kind of booing her like it didn't make her smile. It didn't make her sad. It was nothing. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=609.12s)]
*  Yeah. There was one guy in the crowd. This is kind of really funny. Like, cause the crowd [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=615.16s)]
*  was like basically a Buffalo Bills, like tailgate, like, like the beginning was like the Hollywood [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=619.56s)]
*  people and then the stands were like football. It's kind of nice. Oh, God. Thank God LA could [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=624.12s)]
*  do that. I think people flew in or they're like Boston ties. Right. Kim's up. She's doing [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=628.52s)]
*  her set. She's like almost at the end of the set. And then this guy just in the stands [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=634.84s)]
*  out of nowhere just goes, bitch. I was talking to McKeever and Shane and McKeever was like, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=641.0s)]
*  it was as if he'd been holding it in for a whole minute. He just couldn't hold it anymore. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=656.36s)]
*  His fists were bald. Bitch. Just seeing Kim Kardashian on stage for three minutes was [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=662.0s)]
*  too much. That was a Kanye fit. No, it was cool. What a crazy thing. Like how often is [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=669.24s)]
*  Kim talk in front of like thousands and thousands of just like regular human beings? Like, you [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=677.16s)]
*  know what I mean? Like her whole life is so like protected and maybe that's why she's [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=683.12s)]
*  dissociated. It was like overwhelming. It might be like, oh yeah. Like you said, like a coping [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=686.24s)]
*  mechanism for it. Yeah. Yeah. I'm trying to think of anything else I saw. Oh, the fire [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=690.36s)]
*  thing was when Tom checked Jeff Ross. Bro. I think that was 100% real. Oh yeah. Oh, really? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=694.68s)]
*  100%. I like so Jeff. So I think it got cut from the broadcast. I'll tell you also, the [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=701.08s)]
*  reason why I think it's real is cause they told us no jokes about happy endings with Bob [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=705.96s)]
*  Kraft. Cause I had a Bob Kraft tag. I had that joke about Randy Moss. I was like, Randy [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=710.24s)]
*  Moss, you made sure on Superbowl Sunday is the only people celebrating a happy ending [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=715.4s)]
*  with a priest. Oh yeah. And then the tag was and of course Bob Kraft. And they were like, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=719.16s)]
*  Tom asked us not to do anything with the massage. I was like, all right, cool. Like the guy's [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=726.32s)]
*  coming here for this thing. Like whatever. He's not getting roasted. He's sitting in the [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=730.24s)]
*  fucking stands. And then Jeff did it. And then Tom walks up and he goes, yo, cut that [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=734.2s)]
*  shit out or don't do that again. Don't say that shit again. But think about it like this [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=740.5600000000001s)]
*  is the first comic that goes on a live roast and it's your night. Yeah. He was ready to [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=746.1600000000001s)]
*  shut the whole thing down. That's an alpha ass move. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Like for, for [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=752.9200000000001s)]
*  this guy who basically let him go. Yeah. Bob Kraft didn't resign him. Yeah. And he still [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=759.6s)]
*  feels that kind of loyalty. Brady would sign team friendly deals relatively speaking. So [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=766.12s)]
*  it's not like Kraft overpaid him. Like when they paid Kobe 25 million his last year or [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=770.56s)]
*  whatever, and he was kind of washed was like, thank you. Yeah. Brady, God let go. He got [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=775.3199999999999s)]
*  the opposite. It was like, all right, good luck. Yeah. And still had that kind of loyalties. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=779.0799999999999s)]
*  I thought it was a, it was an alpha. Most people get caught up in that moment and go, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=783.1999999999999s)]
*  I don't want to ruin. And he's like, this shit don't matter. Yeah. What matters is I [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=787.2s)]
*  said to that guy that those jokes weren't going to be made. Yeah. And he agreed to come. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=791.88s)]
*  And then you broke the rule. I think it was that. And then Brady's kids. And it was just [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=796.2800000000001s)]
*  like, who's going to fuck. Yeah. Brady's psycho. He's a psycho. He's the greatest. He's also [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=800.5600000000001s)]
*  like breathtaking. Oh yeah. It was like hard to look at him. Like I would like roast him [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=808.4000000000001s)]
*  I find myself going, I feel like look back at the cameras too much. Oh man. I wonder [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=812.96s)]
*  if he does that early. If he's like, okay, the first thing that crossed the line, I'm [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=820.9200000000001s)]
*  going to, I'm going to get up there and make like a little moment to let everyone else [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=824.2s)]
*  know. Like when you fire a guy the first day on set, who is it? Orson Welles would do that. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=827.44s)]
*  Yeah. He'd hire a guy just to fire him. Yeah. That's great. Apparently that's what they're [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=832.08s)]
*  like set a tone and let everyone know like, yo, don't fuck around. So he's like the first [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=836.48s)]
*  thing that crossed my line, I'm going to stand up and stop it. And that way everyone [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=839.36s)]
*  else knows like, yo, don't talk about the kids. Don't talk about Bobby Kraft. I wonder [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=842.96s)]
*  if then maybe him and Jeff had that worked out then. I don't think so. I think he just [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=846.48s)]
*  was like the first thing that crossed my life. They talk about these two or whatever number [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=850.6s)]
*  of things in his head. That would make a lot of sense. I'm nipping it. Yeah. That's what [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=853.92s)]
*  I'm assuming. It makes sense. I was wondering why no one made the kissing his kid joke. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=857.4s)]
*  I mean, it would have gone, but at the same time it's like the way I look at these things [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=861.96s)]
*  is Giselle's a public figure outside of him. Yeah. So yeah, we could talk about that. Yeah. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=866.96s)]
*  If it's not someone who's public and it's like family or like children, then I'm like, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=873.6800000000001s)]
*  I don't want to fuck with him. Giselle's a supermodel. She used to screw me. And that [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=878.6800000000001s)]
*  was kind of our line of thinking with the Will and Jada thing is like Jada's a celebrity [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=882.84s)]
*  who's been a celebrity. She's asking for attention. She has this show out. Like she talks about [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=886.9200000000001s)]
*  she wants that spoken about as well. Yeah. But yeah, any other, any other, any other [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=891.68s)]
*  reactions? I want to fucking talk about MSG, dude. Oh, I have a question. Yes. What was [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=897.12s)]
*  the best joke you thought against you? Oh, that's good. There weren't a ton. I'll be [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=902.68s)]
*  honest. Yo, I think to be honest, I think what everybody thought was, oh, everybody's [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=909.16s)]
*  going to make fun of his haircut. Yeah. So I don't want to do what everybody does. So [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=913.3599999999999s)]
*  to give you guys some like behind the scenes shit, it's like everybody's making fun of [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=918.16s)]
*  the same people. So the jokes kind of get used up quick. Yeah. Right. And so you got [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=923.48s)]
*  to kind of like worry like, oh, can I do this? Is this going to happen? The later and later [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=929.0s)]
*  you go on the roast, the more and more jokes and topics get crossed off. Even if it's not [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=934.12s)]
*  the same joke, if it's about the same thing, it gets a little diluted. Yeah. So like there [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=937.1999999999999s)]
*  was jokes that like, so we were working with one of the producers there, right? Who is [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=941.64s)]
*  helping us. And basically he wouldn't tell us. He'd be like, hey, listen, this thing is [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=946.28s)]
*  probably I showed him my jokes. And he's like, this thing's probably going to be kind of [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=950.76s)]
*  touched on. So maybe you want to cut it or do that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Michael Lawrence. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=954.44s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Genius writer. And he wrote for a lot of the the the athletes and stuff like [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=959.96s)]
*  that. And he was like, okay, this one is like, we had a we had a good one. It was like, you [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=965.08s)]
*  know, I said I said something about Giselle and I was like, you know, Tom, I go, I go, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=972.6s)]
*  Tom, a wife leaving is never something to joke about. But let's take a stab at it. I [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=977.48s)]
*  was the last text Tom got from OJ. And like, but the OJ stuff had been done a little bit. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=983.24s)]
*  Yeah. So especially going later in the show, you're like, okay, how can I have a unique [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=989.5600000000001s)]
*  angle? Right. Yeah. But but yes. So these producers are organizing all that. It's quite [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=993.48s)]
*  impressive, actually. Do you know what I mean? Like, you have to make sure how many different [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=999.4s)]
*  people on that fucking roast? 15 different people who are all talking about the same [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1003.8000000000001s)]

*  end and he didn't really have nothing, bro. He didn't really have nothing, son. I'm not [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1081.84s)]

*  see the prompters too. Yeah. So you can see the jokes that. Oh, you see. Yeah, those [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1091.6s)]
*  ridges. Me and Sam fucked up somebody's joke because I saw a punch line and me and Sam [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1097.4399999999998s)]
*  started going, oh, that's just good. And he hadn't even said it yet. Yeah. I forget who it was, but Sam and I are laughing at this shit because we're reading the head. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1101.96s)]
*  Yeah, bro. There's a part of this funny. Tony's doing a joke and you just see Bert behind him [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1109.6000000000001s)]
*  mouthing the words to the joke as he's saying it. I was dying laughing. I was like, oh, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1113.3600000000001s)]
*  I forget there's a prompter. That was gronk the entire time. No, he's mouthing. He's reading [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1117.44s)]
*  in his head, but mouthing the words. That's awesome. I would do the same thing a million [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1120.96s)]
*  percent. I just like to be ahead. Yeah, it was really good. And I think that like a kind [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1127.28s)]
*  of way I've analyzed is like a like I think a year ago, maybe even more like the idea [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1135.48s)]
*  of, you know, what is it? Cancel culture, woke culture is affecting comedy. Like that's [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1139.72s)]
*  done. Like if you're still talking about that now, you're just fucking rifting on it. Yeah. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1145.12s)]
*  Maybe not with everybody. So like 10 minutes in, I'm watching my shorty, she's really enjoying [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1148.76s)]
*  it. And then she's like, they're being kind of mean. I really feel bad for gronk. She [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1157.56s)]
*  felt so bad. I'm not even making a joke. Culturally, she's not, you know, what a roast is. If you [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1165.0s)]
*  know what a roast is, if you have any idea of in comedy, what a roast is, you get it. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1170.16s)]
*  This is all bets are off. My wife probably would have said the same thing if she'd watched [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1175.0s)]
*  that early. She'd been like, oh, but she's enough. You know, I mean, she gets it. Yeah. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1178.92s)]
*  You know how like she was ready to check. This is too much. You're not. This is like, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1182.52s)]
*  it's weirdly might have happened the same venue, but you're not like when Magic Johnson said [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1188.12s)]
*  he had AIDS, everybody was like, oh, this shit real. Yeah. I think it happened. It was [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1191.16s)]
*  announced at the forum. Okay. I think this will be like the defining point in our generation [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1196.0s)]
*  where people go, oh, the woke shit's dead. And it's already been dead. Tony, I mean, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1203.94s)]
*  Tony said the F bomb live on Netflix, but it's like no tweets. The point I'm trying [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1209.38s)]
*  to make is like, it's already been dead. Yeah. But this was a moment where you had people [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1215.9s)]
*  that had everything to lose. Yeah. Tom Brady, the guy who could be worth a billion dollars. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1220.98s)]
*  He has these like, you know, mainstream connections. He's going to be on Fox hosting the show. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1225.66s)]
*  And he's making gay jokes and people are making gay jokes about him. Racism, homophobic jokes, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1231.62s)]
*  but nobody really seemed to go, oh my God. Yeah. And to me, that's like the pendulum [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1236.1399999999999s)]
*  swinging and this is like the cultural point. It already has happened. We've noticed it. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1242.1s)]
*  It's like you roll your eyes when anybody says woke anymore. Yeah. But this is like, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1246.58s)]
*  I think the moment America realizes. Yeah. So we'll see what happens after this. I'm [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1250.54s)]
*  very curious. Maybe that's why there was no good roasts for seven, eight years. Whether [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1256.22s)]
*  it would have gone well or not, I bet suits were like, we can't risk it. We can't take this. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1260.74s)]
*  Your honours are right. That from the people I spoke to. They're like, yeah, everybody's afraid [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1264.7s)]
*  to do it because the jokes that are funny, they don't want to say. It's not the comics that are [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1269.1s)]
*  afraid. It's the celebrities. And the execs were like, oh, I don't know, this could get us in [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1273.98s)]
*  trouble. Wow. We could lose sponsors. Yeah. That's a great point. I'm admitting to Deflategate. Oh, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1277.98s)]
*  shit. So I might put a little asterisk on it. Give me 20 million. I would have admitted it. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1284.14s)]
*  Now his set was good. Yeah. That Kanye Kim joke is great. Great. I wish I knew Kim was there. I had [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1291.5s)]
*  no clue. Yeah. When I did the rehearsal, I saw a chair that said Kim Kardashian and I was like, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1297.1000000000001s)]
*  get the fuck out of here. Yeah. And I wonder if the production was saving that for Tom to make [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1302.6200000000001s)]
*  that joke. Maybe. You know what I mean? Like, because poor Tom got to go up at the end. Yeah. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1309.1s)]
*  So like, what does he have left? Yeah. You know, I'm sick. Champion. Just cool all around. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1315.1s)]
*  Absolute champion. And then you talked to Tom? Yeah. Yeah. I got to talk to Tom a little bit. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1320.86s)]
*  How long was the conversation? Tell me everything he said. What did he smell like? [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1324.3s)]
*  Just a nice dude. Like, you know, just I just asked him one, how he prepared. I was like, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1331.26s)]
*  were you like working it out? He's I would do it in front of the guys. Yeah. So I imagine the guys [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1335.98s)]
*  are like, you know, maybe the players are like his team. Yeah. But it looked like he had done the [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1340.14s)]
*  jokes before. Yeah. You know. And but yeah, that was that was about it. Nothing crazy with Tom. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1343.98s)]
*  Drew Bledsoe is a fucking G. Yeah. He seems awesome. Like fun. Yeah. Like him and his brothers are [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1349.9s)]

*  Woodson, like just getting to meet these guys. Yeah. You also meet some of these football [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1377.74s)]
*  players that you've seen in pads and they're tall. But like a Charles Woodson, like the guys that he [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1382.9399999999998s)]
*  would have to tap. Yeah. And then you see him and you're like, he's not the most physical. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1388.94s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Also, post career, these guys deflate like crazy. But no, I did it. Clonk is much [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1393.26s)]

*  And they're funny. Like the thing about Tom, like, you know, you've been to Boston. So I just think [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1474.3799999999999s)]
*  you're from there. And then I saw you run. I was like, no, he's definitely from San Francisco. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1480.3s)]

*  But you say what you want to say first. Okay. The most difficult part of the whole thing was [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1575.74s)]
*  trying to not mouth the N word when 50 cent was on. It was the only thing that was going through [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1579.5s)]
*  my mind. 50s on, first of all, I didn't even know about G unit showing up. So they tell us that like [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1584.8600000000001s)]
*  maybe an hour before. Yeah. They're like, we need three mics. And I go, what? And then they're like, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1590.38s)]

*  to drop it. So I'm concentrating on not saying the N word. Tony Ayo's at the front of the stage, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1611.66s)]
*  comes back, right? I hope we have video for this because there is an ultimate, I missed a dap. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1616.46s)]
*  And by missed, I mean, he didn't even acknowledge my dap. I threw the hand up like this. I think [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1622.3799999999999s)]

*  No, I think we need to delete all the footage because if you, I'm unfortunately standing [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1644.62s)]
*  directly behind 50 Cent the whole time. And I'm just in a daze. I'm like, holy shit, this is crazy. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1648.06s)]

*  I was like, wait a second. I feel like an idiot. And then I was looking at 50. I was like, yo, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1681.98s)]
*  I'm just going to do a 50 Cent does because he's cool. And if I just copy him, then no one can say [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1685.74s)]
*  anything. Okay. So 50 was doing this move where he's standing there. He goes like this and he's [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1689.4199999999998s)]

*  then if you cut over to me, I look so bad. I just look like a backup dancer the whole time. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1702.62s)]
*  So I knew Mark was on fire. I just saw my arm around him. I just had to just hold him because I knew. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1710.14s)]
*  Because Derek and I were really into it and Mark was just alone. He didn't know how to be too into [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1715.34s)]
*  it. But he is dead centric. Oh my God. Just in it. And the problem is, I did the thing whiter than [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1719.98s)]

*  Oh my God. There is one moment where I think none of them said the N word. I think they all [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1805.26s)]
*  ducked it themselves out of pure professionalism. I imagine they've done this. They were choreographed. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1809.74s)]
*  It was really awesome to see what they were doing and really utilizing the whole stage. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1817.66s)]
*  Clearly they've been doing this shit for fucking decades. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1821.9s)]

*  If you had taken Derek's advice, yeah. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1838.78s)]
*  I would be the only one in the arena that would have screamed it. If I just gronked it, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1842.94s)]
*  if I got caught up in momentum. It would have echoed. Stopped the tape. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1849.58s)]
*  It was crazy. 50 is a fucking man, dude. Just to do that. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=1857.5s)]

*  It's just crazy, man. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2132.64s)]
*  Oh, that was so beautiful. I still haven't taken it in. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2133.84s)]
*  That's so crazy, man. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2136.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2137.76s)]
*  It's so fucking nuts. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2138.2400000000002s)]
*  Madison Square Garden. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2140.2400000000002s)]
*  Wow. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2141.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2142.08s)]
*  Wow. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2143.36s)]
*  Honestly, at the end, we took a picture in the stands. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2145.2000000000003s)]
*  It's kind of weird. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2148.96s)]
*  It's weird. Such a weird being a human being. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2149.68s)]
*  Like the things that you can, I want to say get used to, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2153.6s)]
*  but since we have done some arenas, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2156.0s)]
*  they do kind of look similar from the stage. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2158.96s)]
*  You still walk in, you're like, what the fuck? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2162.8799999999997s)]
*  But it isn't an experience that we haven't had. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2165.2799999999997s)]
*  In other words, we have experienced it before. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2168.8799999999997s)]
*  Obviously, the garden means so much more. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2171.44s)]
*  But when we went into the stands and then looked down, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2173.2s)]
*  they were turning it into the hockey rink. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2175.68s)]
*  At the end, it was just this like, what? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2178.64s)]
*  When we were walking around and saw concession stands, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2180.48s)]
*  we're like, whoa, people sell hot dogs at the venue we performed at? [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2182.48s)]
*  It was, I guess, weirdly enough, being outside of the performance area [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2187.44s)]
*  is where it really seemed like this. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2192.16s)]
*  Secondly, I was just walking all around. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2195.44s)]
*  I was just walking everywhere. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2198.7200000000003s)]
*  Just feeling it. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2199.92s)]
*  What the fuck? I just couldn't believe this. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2200.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2203.28s)]
*  People selling shirts outside. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2203.6s)]
*  Yeah, the street vendor making money on the people coming in. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2205.76s)]
*  Isn't this crazy? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2208.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, the Boo Legs were kind of fire, bro. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2209.04s)]
*  What? Really? [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2211.2000000000003s)]
*  Boo Legs were kind of fire. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2212.48s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2213.52s)]
*  Gotta hire them motherfuckers. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2215.2000000000003s)]
*  I bet it was the dude who made our shirt. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2217.2000000000003s)]
*  Ali, we need to talk, bro. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2221.52s)]
*  That's actually a great hustle. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2224.1600000000003s)]
*  You find out what shirt is going to be sold there [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2225.12s)]
*  and then you just make your own version of it. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2227.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2229.6800000000003s)]
*  Have you been to the garden? [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2230.32s)]
*  No. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2231.36s)]
*  I should pay attention to that thing. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2232.82s)]
*  We should start that. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2234.34s)]
*  We should do that instead. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2235.1400000000003s)]
*  Also, just how it ended up. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2237.3s)]
*  The only way that that show could have happened was one scenario. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2239.38s)]
*  I don't know if I've explained this on the pod since. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2243.3s)]
*  No. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2245.46s)]
*  So, there was only one scenario that that show happens. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2246.34s)]
*  The Saturday show. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2251.86s)]
*  The Saturday show. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2252.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, sorry. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2253.6200000000003s)]
*  The Friday was locked in, but the Saturday. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2254.02s)]
*  Okay. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2256.42s)]
*  So, basically, the Knicks had to go to six games and win in six. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2257.7000000000003s)]
*  We didn't know that. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2262.82s)]
*  So, I was told all the Knicks had to do was win. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2263.7000000000003s)]
*  They had to just clinch, right? [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2266.5s)]
*  And in game five, I'm like hoping that they win and then we go. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2268.7400000000002s)]
*  So, I start the day of game five going the Knicks got to win. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2271.54s)]
*  Midway through the day of game five, they go, hey, if the Knicks win and the Pacers win, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2275.38s)]
*  then they're going to start their next series on Saturday. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2280.34s)]
*  You lose your Saturday show. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2284.02s)]
*  I go, fuck. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2285.54s)]
*  So, I need the Knicks win, but then the Pacers will lose, right? [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2286.1s)]
*  Then a little later, no, sorry, then during the game, we get the text message and it says, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2289.14s)]
*  if Carolina, the Carolina Hurricanes beat the Islanders, they'll sweep them. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2296.02s)]
*  They're going to start their series with the Rangers on Saturday. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2300.98s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2304.2599999999998s)]
*  So, now I'm watching three games. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2306.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2307.54s)]
*  I'm looking at three different scenarios. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2308.1s)]
*  The Knicks lose, but so do the Pacers. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2310.5s)]
*  Not like it would have mattered, but they did lose as well. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2314.5s)]
*  So, the Pacers have to extend. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2316.26s)]
*  Now, we're in a tricky situation. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2318.18s)]
*  The Carolina Hurricanes won, so they can play the Rangers, but the Knicks have priority in that [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2320.5s)]
*  Saturday date. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2329.2200000000003s)]
*  So, the NHL has to wait until the Knicks win game six to even announce. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2330.98s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2338.5s)]
*  I think so, yeah. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2339.2200000000003s)]
*  Basically, what I'm saying is the Knicks own that Saturday. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2340.1s)]
*  They have priority over NHL. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2343.14s)]
*  NHL wants the Saturday, but they can't claim it until the Knicks no longer need it. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2344.66s)]
*  They won't know until the Knicks win game six. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2350.66s)]
*  Which is Thursday night. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2353.22s)]
*  Which is Thursday. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2354.18s)]
*  And so, are they really going to promote, announce, and get all the teams there with 24 hours notice? [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2355.2999999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2360.82s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2361.2999999999997s)]
*  Because you got to sell tickets. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2361.7799999999997s)]
*  Because you have to do all these things. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2362.66s)]
*  You have to have people have plans, there's travelers, everything. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2364.02s)]
*  So, they don't tell us until 3 p.m. the day before. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2366.2599999999998s)]
*  So, they have until 3 p.m. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2373.46s)]
*  We finally get the message the day before. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2374.5s)]
*  And then, obviously, the Knicks go close out and win. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2377.86s)]
*  All right, guys. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2380.18s)]
*  We're going to take a break real quick because we have to talk. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2380.74s)]
*  Have you heard that the flavored air category is quickly becoming the leading alternative to vaping? [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2382.98s)]
*  It's a whole new movement towards better habits led by the sponsor of today's video, Fume. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2387.94s)]
*  Fume is an award-winning flavored air device, and it isn't like vaping. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2393.38s)]
*  If vapor was like a sugary soda, Fume cores would be closer to like an herbal tea. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2398.1s)]
*  They have lots of delicious flavors to choose from like Crisp Mint and Orange Vanilla. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2403.7s)]
*  I like both of those. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2406.9s)]
*  This is not a vape. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2407.94s)]
*  There is no vapor. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2409.14s)]
*  You can use it anywhere. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2410.1s)]
*  And most importantly, guys, there is no nicotine and it is not addictive. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2410.98s)]
*  So, if you have these bad habits like vaping or certain other things that we cannot mention, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2414.98s)]
*  less electronic versions of vaping, yeah, Fume is the way to go. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2419.46s)]
*  Personally, again, I like Crisp Mint and Orange Vanilla. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2423.46s)]
*  But you guys figure out whatever flavor you want. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=2426.02s)]

*  But I really don't know how it really got leaked. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3006.5s)]
*  But I asked him about it and he said, [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3009.38s)]
*  he didn't give me a yes or no. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3011.3s)]
*  He was just like, yo, could you get that taken down? [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3012.5s)]
*  That already told me. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3017.1400000000003s)]

*  Fuck it, I'm going to go on stream. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3027.94s)]
*  Let's at least play around with some of these alternate versions of what this could be. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3029.62s)]
*  I'm playing the song. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3034.1s)]
*  You know, people are they're kind of having this lukewarm response [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3035.62s)]
*  because it's a very unmixed, unfinished song. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3038.02s)]
*  I look at my phone, see, stop playing that bullshit. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3040.98s)]

*  I put the real shit on. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3045.94s)]
*  And I don't know how people listen faster than me [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3047.8599999999997s)]
*  because I think we're all moving in seconds. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3050.1s)]
*  But I get it almost damn near first. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3051.7799999999997s)]
*  And I'm playing it. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3055.06s)]
*  Everyone in my chat, they're spamming, you're on the song. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3056.8199999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3059.38s)]
*  I get to about like the end of the song. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3062.34s)]
*  I hear the voice note from me, which is from my stream. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3064.5s)]
*  And I'm like, holy shit. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3067.06s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3069.54s)]
*  That was your Madison Square Garden. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3070.34s)]
*  For me, like, you know, like I remember when every rapper's ever mentioned me. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3073.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3078.26s)]
*  I remember Em even mentioned me. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3078.6600000000003s)]
*  I was like, oh shit, Eminem is like mentioned. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3079.86s)]
*  When Drake used that clip, I was like, I've been immortalized. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3082.6600000000003s)]
*  That's it. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3086.58s)]
*  That's it. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3087.86s)]
*  Because I remember I remember back to back Charlotte like, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3089.0s)]
*  you know, you go make me Bob Bob. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3093.08s)]
*  So that's it. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3094.6800000000003s)]
*  And I was just like, one day, one day. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3095.88s)]
*  That's what I thought. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3099.48s)]
*  The bigger cosign was 616 in L.A. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3100.2000000000003s)]
*  When they identify you as the ops, that's like no, no. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3102.6s)]
*  When both of them, when they both mentioned me, the 616 in L.A. thing, [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3105.6400000000003s)]
*  which OK, so now, you know, this whole thing is happening. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3110.6800000000003s)]
*  Drake drops. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3114.52s)]
*  And of course, I'm going to be honest with you. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3115.96s)]
*  I really didn't think Kendrick was going to drop. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3119.0s)]
*  Because like the word was just that, you know, even I've said, [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3121.88s)]
*  popularly, I said he's good at making moments. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3125.56s)]
*  He's not going to like disses. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3127.2400000000002s)]
*  Is it is like seeing a guy and he's hitting like the speed back and you're like, [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3129.2400000000002s)]
*  yo, this guy's a fighter, but you've never seen him fight. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3133.1600000000003s)]
*  You really don't know. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3136.28s)]
*  So it's like, let's go off you thinking I'm a great fighter rather than [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3137.48s)]
*  seeing how I move when the pressure is really on. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3141.0s)]
*  And you really didn't think he was going to drop? [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3143.96s)]
*  He's been calling for this. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3146.12s)]
*  No, no, not like I'm dropping back to back. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3147.08s)]
*  I thought he was going to respond maybe on his album, [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3150.04s)]
*  but in like a little tasteful way. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3152.28s)]
*  Not like, OK, let's drop song for song. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3153.96s)]
*  Let's do it now. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3156.12s)]
*  So I know Drake was ready to do it now. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3157.2400000000002s)]
*  So I started a countdown. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3159.32s)]
*  I'm like, all right, let's see. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3160.44s)]
*  And I honestly thought I was going to go to like, yo, this is day 70, not responding. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3161.7200000000003s)]
*  Day 17 came, he dropped Euphoria. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3167.56s)]
*  I'm like fucking shocked. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3169.56s)]
*  I'm like, what the fuck is going on? [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3171.2400000000002s)]
*  They're dropping songs back to back. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3172.84s)]
*  And then I also start realizing something very unique. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3174.36s)]
*  My stream is almost the place where this the biggest, if you ask me, [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3178.6800000000003s)]
*  the biggest beef in hip hop history and musically, right? [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3186.44s)]
*  Because obviously, you know, we don't dig in and pocket. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3190.36s)]
*  Those had really serious dioramifications. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3193.1600000000003s)]
*  But just musically, this is the most songs you've ever got. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3195.96s)]
*  Hip hop is bigger than it was 25 years ago. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3199.08s)]
*  The consumption is crazier. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3201.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3202.84s)]
*  Right. And I'm watching this and I'm like, this is all playing out [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3203.3199999999997s)]
*  where my stream is the town square. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3209.08s)]
*  You're the epicenter of it all. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3212.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3213.48s)]
*  I'm the radio station. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3214.04s)]
*  I'm not only the media, but I'm like the reflection and where the fans are coming to [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3215.72s)]
*  to consume this for the first time. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3221.4s)]
*  And I'm the premier. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3224.12s)]
*  You know, I know that push ups drop next day. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3225.64s)]
*  Actually, push ups drops the official. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3230.84s)]
*  So I'm on a 10 hour actually, I've been 12 hours live stream. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3234.92s)]
*  I'm playing the leak version. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3239.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3240.52s)]
*  Two hours later, I get the real version. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3241.1600000000003s)]
*  So I'm like, fuck it. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3243.56s)]
*  We got the real version now. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3244.6s)]
*  And there's an extra beat at the end. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3245.88s)]
*  I'm playing that shit. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3247.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm like, OK, this is dope. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3249.08s)]
*  Two and a half hours later, which by the way, shows how long I stream for. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3251.48s)]
*  Two and a half hours later, Rick Ross's man hits me. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3254.76s)]
*  And I'm thinking he just wants to call into the stream. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3257.8s)]
*  Shout out to my man, Sam Sneek. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3259.56s)]
*  He said, hit me. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3261.32s)]
*  It's important. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3262.52s)]
*  It's urgent. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3263.24s)]
*  I'm like, OK, you probably just want to get on. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3263.64s)]
*  I just want to ask him like, why does Rick Ross not like Drake? [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3265.4s)]
*  Did Drake steal his wings? [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3268.44s)]
*  I was like, what's going on? [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3269.4s)]
*  Yo, he calls into the stream. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3271.16s)]
*  He's like, just check your phone. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3273.08s)]
*  Ross goes into the studio, makes a diss song in three hours. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3275.0s)]
*  They sent out how quickly they did everything. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3278.84s)]
*  They sent it to me while I'm still on stream. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3281.16s)]
*  They like premier that. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3283.16s)]
*  That happens. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3284.84s)]
*  Also, simultaneously, the R&B. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3286.2799999999997s)]
*  Like, listen, I blame all this on Cat Williams. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3289.24s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3291.4s)]
*  Ever since he said that. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3291.7999999999997s)]
*  Truly. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3293.0s)]
*  Truly. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3293.7999999999997s)]
*  He was a catalyst for it. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3293.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3295.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3295.7999999999997s)]
*  Then. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3296.3599999999997s)]
*  Because you saw it get. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3296.7599999999998s)]
*  I really think you saw it could get rewarded. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3297.72s)]
*  Cat has like 60 million views or whatever on that episode. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3300.12s)]
*  We all want to see his new special. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3303.24s)]
*  That came out, I think, Saturday. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3304.52s)]
*  It kind of revived Cat in a way. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3306.12s)]
*  So I think a lot of people like me who love being haters were like, oh, [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3307.7999999999997s)]
*  you could get rewarded for this. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3312.68s)]
*  Whereas for 20 years before that, it was like, [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3314.12s)]
*  have you got negative shit to say everybody's going to look at you crazy? [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3316.12s)]
*  Just fall back. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3318.7599999999998s)]
*  But I feel like if it's substantiated and you got it and it's logically sound, [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3319.88s)]
*  people will reward it. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3322.92s)]
*  And I think 2024 has been like that for that reason. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3323.7999999999997s)]
*  And I'm in this moment of realizing this shift that's happened. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3326.2s)]
*  I'm like, did Ross really just send me? [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3329.56s)]
*  Like, I know some people joke about the DJ on my name. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3332.04s)]
*  They be like, yo, you're just academics, bro. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3336.04s)]
*  You haven't DJed in a while, which to be fair, I haven't DJed in a long time. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3337.96s)]
*  I used to do it back in college. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3341.0s)]
*  But that's what the quintessential role of a DJ is, a premier record. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3342.6s)]
*  So I get that from Ross and I'm like, oh shit. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3347.08s)]
*  And I'm like, all right, I'm kind of going through the moments here. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3350.2s)]
*  Another song drops and Quavo and Chris Brown, they're beefing too. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3353.48s)]
*  I almost call that an R&B beef, but it's not because he was a rapper. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3358.2s)]
*  And Chris Brown goes crazy. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3362.52s)]
*  By the way, it seems like everybody's fighting over girls, right? [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3365.4s)]
*  They go crazy. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3368.44s)]
*  Quavo calls me the next morning. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3369.8s)]
*  Instantly, I'm thinking because I've had a conversation with Quavo before. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3372.44s)]
*  And I'm thinking he's mad at me for something I said on the stream [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3375.64s)]
*  because I get pretty heated and passionate and sometimes I say some shit. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3378.2s)]
*  And I do try to get my, I'm not Schultz or anything or Akash or anything or Marc, [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3382.12s)]
*  but I try to get my little jokes off. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3386.2799999999997s)]
*  You're very funny. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3387.48s)]
*  I'm very funny. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3388.2s)]
*  I get the call. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3389.64s)]
*  Quavo says, yo, act. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3391.24s)]
*  I, yo, he's like, yo, you hyped up that Chris Brown song so crazy? [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3394.2s)]
*  He said, why are you doing me like that? [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3399.64s)]
*  I'm like, I'm just reacting to music like new music is dropping. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3400.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3403.32s)]
*  Yo, he's like, you know, I was going to come back, right? [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3403.88s)]
*  I said, word? [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3406.28s)]
*  I said, good. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3406.84s)]
*  He's like, yo, I got it, but I only want you to drop it. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3408.0400000000004s)]
*  Fire. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3411.48s)]
*  I'm like, let's do it. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3413.4s)]
*  Let's do it. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3415.4s)]
*  So pretty much ever since then. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3416.5200000000004s)]
*  And then every time after that, while I was on stream, Kendrick, [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3418.44s)]
*  and I have no communication with the team, Kendrick drops only when I'm on stream. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3424.1200000000003s)]
*  He hasn't done a non-stream drop since you four. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3428.28s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3431.32s)]
*  He's dropped five songs. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3432.6800000000003s)]
*  So we also stream 12 hours a day. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3434.0400000000004s)]
*  You're on stream a lot. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3435.88s)]
*  That's a good one. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3436.84s)]
*  I'm not gonna. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3437.6400000000003s)]
*  If you're never not on stream, he's gonna drop. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3440.1200000000003s)]
*  Son, you were on stream at 9 15 in the morning when he dropped Friday? [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3442.84s)]
*  This Friday? [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3447.7200000000003s)]
*  6 16 in LA. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3448.0400000000004s)]
*  That's 9 16 in LA. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3448.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3450.2000000000003s)]
*  God damn, dude. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3451.7200000000003s)]
*  What were you doing? [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3452.44s)]
*  No, I'll tell you why. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3453.48s)]
*  I'll tell you why I was on stream. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3454.2000000000003s)]
*  So the night before I'm on stream, and I ain't gonna lie, I was blessed. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3455.8799999999997s)]
*  I got on stream early. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3463.48s)]
*  Usually I do six hours. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3464.7599999999998s)]
*  It's about like two hours and 45 minutes. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3465.96s)]
*  He said, I gotta go. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3468.12s)]
*  Yo, I started looking up because you know me, on my streams, we do everything live. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3469.08s)]
*  So we're Googling, we're doing things, we're getting lyrics, we're trying to connect dots. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3474.04s)]
*  And I remember I had like a cup of tequila and I was mixed with orange juice. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3478.3599999999997s)]
*  And sometimes I'll be turning up to music before while drinking. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3484.2s)]
*  I don't know what happened. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3487.3199999999997s)]
*  I might have drunk myself. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3488.2799999999997s)]
*  I might have did it myself, my brother. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3489.24s)]
*  You get what I'm saying? [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3491.0s)]
*  And what happened was like, I started looking up at the screen and the words were just like [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3492.2s)]
*  I was dyslexic. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3497.16s)]
*  And usually when that happens, it's like I'm clear. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3500.12s)]
*  Powered down. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3503.72s)]
*  Yeah, I'm clear-voined enough to know, hey, when you're talking, you have to think to talk. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3504.2799999999997s)]
*  And you usually talk for 10 hours without thinking. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3510.3599999999997s)]
*  And I'm hearing words getting kind of mingled. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3513.16s)]
*  And I'm like, I gotta get off of here because the audience might not know the instant drop off. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3516.8399999999997s)]
*  But cerebrally, like I'm dumb. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3523.56s)]
*  It's only going to get worse. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3528.68s)]
*  And I think I just like cut the stream off. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3530.68s)]
*  I lost power. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3532.8399999999997s)]
*  I didn't want to tell them. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3535.08s)]
*  But you did. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3535.88s)]
*  So I'm feeling so guilty because at this point, they're used to the six hours. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3538.12s)]
*  They're like, what the fuck was that? [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3541.56s)]
*  Three hours? [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3542.84s)]
*  You're a bitch. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3543.4s)]
*  So I'm like, all right, man. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3544.44s)]
*  Let me just get sober. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3546.04s)]
*  The internet started speculating why he just cut the live stream. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3547.16s)]
*  They're telling me that Drake is, yo, Drake must have blah blah blah. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3552.12s)]
*  Like, no. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3555.72s)]
*  So I'm like, because really I was about to break down Drake's lyrics. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3557.16s)]
*  I'm like, you know what? [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3559.72s)]
*  I wake up. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3561.0s)]
*  First thing I do, go feed my dogs, whatever. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3561.96s)]
*  I'm like, yo, I'm on stream, early stream. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3563.88s)]
*  Soon as I get on stream, I'm about to break down Drake's lyrics. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3566.12s)]
*  And I have about like, it's almost like 100,000 people watching. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3569.64s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3574.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3574.68s)]
*  In the morning. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3575.32s)]
*  And I'm like getting to it. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3576.52s)]
*  Like I'm in like the first verse and everyone's like, yo, Kendrick, drop. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3578.36s)]
*  I'm like, I'm looking at the comments. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3581.08s)]
*  I'm like, you guys are fucking trolls. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3582.52s)]
*  Wait, what are you streaming on? [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3584.36s)]
*  I'm streaming on multiple platforms. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3585.72s)]
*  Twitter. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3587.24s)]
*  Twitter, it's crazy. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3587.72s)]
*  So I stream on two YouTube platforms. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3588.2s)]
*  It's a simultaneous stream. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3591.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3592.92s)]
*  You see that? [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3593.24s)]
*  So if you're on Twitch, if you're on... [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3593.96s)]
*  We're about to start streaming on TikTok too. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3595.72s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3597.72s)]
*  For big moments, I get on X as well. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3598.92s)]
*  Because I don't know the monetization strategy yet fully for X, but you know... [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3602.04s)]
*  It's more about eyeballs at this point. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3606.12s)]
*  Like let's create... [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3607.48s)]
*  But you can have one single stream that disseminates to all these different platforms. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3608.2000000000003s)]
*  Just on YouTube, we almost... [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3612.44s)]
*  Within two channels, I have one with like 80,000 and then the other with 30,000. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3614.12s)]
*  Rumble will have about like 35 or 25. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3618.92s)]
*  Dude, at one point, X have like 800,000. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3621.32s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, and then the reach on X is like... [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3624.76s)]
*  Insane. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3627.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3628.62s)]
*  Like, you know, I have some theories about... [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3629.1800000000003s)]
*  Like my Twitter is like, it's like, yeah, steroids right now. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3630.86s)]

*  Yeah, like Elon responded to... [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3634.54s)]
*  Elon responded to like the last stream was like, yo, this is what we're tapped into. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3637.98s)]
*  Like he literally... [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3643.1s)]
*  I go live, it sends out a tweet when you go live on X, and he goes in the comments and says, [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3644.78s)]
*  this is what everyone cares about right now. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3650.86s)]

*  I haven't even listened to all his diss tracks. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3658.62s)]
*  How is Elon tapping into your stream? [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3660.14s)]
*  Well, go make a car. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3663.4199999999996s)]

*  Yeah, they look cool. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3673.8999999999996s)]

*  this is like such a commercially viable and accessible rap beef, [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3679.3399999999997s)]
*  but it's benefiting so many people. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3685.58s)]
*  All right. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3688.2999999999997s)]

*  and all this other stuff. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3693.66s)]
*  But first of all, the way that the media has played a part [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3694.38s)]
*  in this rap beef is really interesting to me, [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3699.5s)]
*  because it's rappers openly using media to promote the songs. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3702.7s)]
*  Whereas back in the day, I don't know if it's like... [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3711.34s)]
*  I don't know if there's a conversation where this person's hitting up DJ Clue [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3715.02s)]
*  and saying, yo, can you play this at this time? [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3719.18s)]
*  And I don't know if it was as open. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3721.42s)]
*  This is open. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3723.5s)]
*  I'm sure it was. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3724.14s)]
*  It's always been like this. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3725.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3726.3s)]
*  All right, so break that down. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3726.78s)]
*  If we go back in time, [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3727.98s)]
*  Charlamagne getting mentioned is literally... [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3731.18s)]
*  Because Charlamagne was on Arrival Station going [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3733.66s)]
*  and Flex was premiering this song to Drake. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3737.7400000000002s)]
*  So how do you kind of... [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3741.18s)]
*  Take a shot at Flex. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3743.42s)]
*  This is why he's like, yo, I'm going to tell Clue drop a bomb on him. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3745.26s)]
*  That's Flex's thing. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3749.82s)]
*  Clue's on the other radio station. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3751.1s)]
*  So it's like trying to take the power and the influence, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3753.1s)]
*  because everyone used to be tuned to that box, which was a radio, [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3756.14s)]
*  and listen to Flex. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3760.54s)]
*  There's a notorious moment in hip hop when Flex premieres Otis, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3762.54s)]
*  which is a song by Kanye and Jay-Z, and he played like 89 times. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3766.46s)]
*  But that made the record. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3771.1s)]
*  Him premiering I Get Money made that record. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3772.94s)]
*  That was the influence that... [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3775.02s)]
*  And that's my argument is that media has always had this. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3776.2200000000003s)]
*  These artists know that... [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3779.34s)]
*  It's not necessarily about premiering the song [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3781.1s)]
*  because these artists now have the platform [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3783.58s)]
*  and these songs are going to do what they're going to do. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3785.5s)]
*  It's like, how do you get to kind of influence the narrative? [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3786.86s)]
*  I've always told people way back even from the 6ix9ine era, [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3791.5s)]
*  I said, listen, I tell every artist, [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3795.98s)]
*  I remember having this conversation with Cardi B, [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3798.06s)]
*  you can't fight media. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3799.9s)]
*  You should, as an artist, you need to... [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3801.5s)]
*  Befriend them, yeah, utilize them, yeah. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3802.94s)]
*  You need to... [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3805.66s)]
*  Again, notoriously, I forgot the famous quote, [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3807.18s)]
*  but it's like, if one story that could be completely career ending, [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3810.3s)]
*  if you have a little bit of influence or relationship [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3817.9s)]
*  with that media outlet, it's just seen as a mistake, [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3820.38s)]
*  rather than this is like this maniacal, intentional thing. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3824.06s)]
*  Because the media is so prolific at creating narratives and storylines [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3828.06s)]
*  and then pushing that information on the people, [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3833.02s)]
*  whereas the rapper can do it and they can address it, [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3834.86s)]
*  but the media is just nonstop and then other people [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3838.6200000000003s)]
*  are picking up what you're saying [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3841.5800000000004s)]
*  and there are blog accounts picking up what other blog accounts [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3843.42s)]
*  have picked up from what you're saying. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3846.54s)]
*  If there is a cohesive effort, for example, [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3849.1000000000004s)]
*  you, Graham Wizard, Keep Six Solid, [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3853.1800000000003s)]
*  if you guys are all Team Drake and pushing out same information, [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3855.98s)]
*  and that's what my feed is, I'm like, well, they gotta be right. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3858.94s)]
*  All these different things. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3861.82s)]
*  Now, here's my question, though. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3862.62s)]
*  Let me just ask it. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3866.38s)]
*  Once everybody knows that you guys are Team Drake, [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3867.58s)]
*  does that make us look at information [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3872.22s)]
*  that is critical of the opposition differently? [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3876.22s)]
*  For example, if I see a Fox News headline [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3878.86s)]
*  talking about some liberal politician, I immediately go, [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3881.34s)]
*  of course, they're going to trash that person, [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3885.8999999999996s)]
*  so I might need to look into this story to see if there's truth there. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3887.8199999999997s)]
*  Do you understand? [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3891.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3892.7s)]
*  Does it discredit the criticism of the other side [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3893.5s)]
*  once we know that you guys have an allegiance? [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3895.9799999999996s)]
*  It does once that doesn't align with what the public thinks. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3899.74s)]
*  Expand that. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3905.2599999999998s)]
*  Like, for example, I came out and I said, hey, listen, [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3906.3799999999997s)]
*  I don't think, by the way, this back and forth is done, [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3911.66s)]
*  but if I had to score it in this cross-section of time, [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3914.7s)]
*  I got Kendrick slightly up. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3917.8199999999997s)]
*  So now the audience goes, okay, he's being honest. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3919.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3921.8199999999997s)]
*  If I'm just saying, Drake, yo, Drake is body. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3923.58s)]
*  Knock them out. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3925.8199999999997s)]
*  Then everybody goes, oh, he's fine. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3926.38s)]
*  Oh, this is a lie. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3927.9s)]
*  You get what I mean? [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3928.7s)]
*  So you feel in order to maintain your credibility with the audience, [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3929.18s)]
*  you have to review things as they are, even though you're openly a fan of... [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3935.58s)]
*  It's almost like there's certain people with Barstool, for example, [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3942.94s)]
*  they might be a big fan of the Patriots or a big fan of the Celtics, [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3948.46s)]
*  but if they're playing like shit, they have to acknowledge [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3952.1400000000003s)]
*  that they're not playing up to the standard or else the audience starts to go, [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3955.82s)]
*  oh, you just say they're good no matter what. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3958.7000000000003s)]
*  I can't trust you. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3961.5800000000004s)]
*  100%. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3962.3s)]
*  Got it. So you still feel a need to go, this is where I see it. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3962.86s)]
*  100%. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3966.86s)]
*  Like so, what we do even on my stream, we're breaking down these attacks at each other, [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3967.36s)]
*  these allegations, and it would be very convenient to be like, well, [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3974.96s)]
*  we'll just keep breaking down the things that would make this person look whatever type of way. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3979.44s)]
*  But you feel responsibility. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3984.4s)]
*  No, you have to. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3985.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3986.2400000000002s)]
*  Even though he's saying certain things about Drake, it's like you gotta look into them. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3987.36s)]
*  And that's the thing about a stream, they can tell when you're hiding something. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3993.2000000000003s)]
*  Like, hey, there's a popular video that's recapping maybe like [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=3996.64s)]
*  some grooming allegations by Drake. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4000.0s)]
*  If you don't go watch that and you're watching everything for 10 hours by God. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4001.68s)]
*  I'll call you out. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4005.04s)]
*  Of course. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4005.8399999999997s)]
*  They're like, yo, you know, so again, you know. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4006.3199999999997s)]
*  What do you think about this? [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4009.12s)]
*  Honestly, I think the grooming thing is bullshit. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4010.3999999999996s)]
*  And I think it's really, and again, I don't know enough about it, [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4013.12s)]
*  but I find it very hard to believe that somebody that is that famous [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4015.6s)]
*  would be open about doing that if those were his intentions. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4020.3199999999997s)]
*  And let me tell you, I personally. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4024.64s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4026.32s)]
*  And also like that label, even the accusation, like think about what the accusation is, right? [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4027.28s)]
*  If somebody goes, yo, you're a pedophile. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4032.16s)]
*  Even if someone accused, I don't even want to say Alex, like even if someone accused Miles. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4035.36s)]
*  Even if someone accused Miles of being a pedophile, knowing that he was accused, [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4042.2400000000002s)]
*  you would never let him babysit your kid, even though you know he's innocent. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4046.56s)]
*  Just the fact that there was an accusation, you'd be like, [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4050.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't even. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4054.08s)]
*  It's such a fucking what is Scarlet letter, even the accusation. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4056.4s)]
*  I think this is going to alter Jax's career for the rest of his life. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4061.2000000000003s)]
*  I think he's going to have to move different and be cognizant. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4064.08s)]
*  You know, the other day he was seen with Lado's little sister. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4068.0s)]
*  She was 21, but still some people were like, why are you with why are you with young girls? [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4072.96s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4079.2000000000003s)]
*  And I think he's going to always take that into accountability. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4080.0s)]
*  I think on either this album, maybe it was Certified Loverboy, he was rapping about [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4083.2s)]
*  like she was 21 or like he's name dropping or age dropping the girls and they're like, [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4088.56s)]
*  cool song. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4095.12s)]
*  And if we remove you from all the lyrics, but if we think in, [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4095.92s)]
*  you know, like he has a song called like TSU, it was like, [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4100.4s)]
*  why is a 37 year old guy rapping about a college campus? [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4103.5199999999995s)]
*  Like, you know what I mean? [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4106.48s)]
*  You've seen the video of the girl being like, Drake hit me up. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4107.68s)]
*  He saw me at he was a fan of high school girls basketball and then he hit me in my [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4111.200000000001s)]
*  and it's like, why are you a fan of any women's basketball? [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4115.52s)]
*  Okay, I won't be honest with you. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4118.400000000001s)]
*  This is just me personally. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4119.84s)]
*  This is me personally. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4122.080000000001s)]
*  They can't even lay up what they're off hand probably. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4123.84s)]
*  I've never met Drake personally. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4126.160000000001s)]
*  I can't tell what he's into or what he's not into. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4128.0s)]
*  I can only tell what I've seen publicly. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4130.4800000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4132.320000000001s)]
*  And I've seen the girls that he's allegedly romantically involved with. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4133.120000000001s)]
*  Um, that's a different conversation. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4137.04s)]
*  And if we're going down this, like, because the thing is, [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4139.919999999999s)]
*  if you accuse somebody of being a pedophile, you're accusing them of like, [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4142.5599999999995s)]
*  in pre pubescent teens, right? [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4145.04s)]
*  Like if Drake is just, it could be post pubescent teens. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4147.12s)]
*  Okay. All right. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4150.16s)]
*  Let me know. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4151.28s)]

*  Whatever. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4159.44s)]
*  I will. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4159.759999999999s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4160.24s)]
*  I don't think there's allegations. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4161.839999999999s)]
*  What the fuck is going on? [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4163.36s)]
*  I don't think there's any allegations. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4164.24s)]
*  Teenage? [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4165.76s)]
*  Teenage? [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4166.400000000001s)]
*  Teenage? [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4166.64s)]
*  Teenage? [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4167.4400000000005s)]
*  Teenage? [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4167.84s)]
*  Teenage? [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4168.400000000001s)]
*  A pedophile is from the age three to eleven. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4169.2s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4171.52s)]
*  That's how I kill this shit. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4172.08s)]
*  When you say teenage, what is going on? [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4173.92s)]
*  Hey, no, no. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4176.4800000000005s)]
*  I guess what I'm saying is that- [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4177.360000000001s)]
*  I think it's bullshit. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4178.400000000001s)]
*  I'll be honest. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4179.360000000001s)]
*  We only see Drake, right? [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4179.92s)]
*  We only see Drake with women who are legal, right? [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4182.400000000001s)]
*  Now, say like Leonardo DiCaprio, right? [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4187.280000000001s)]
*  People are like, yo, you only date girls from like 20 to 25. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4190.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4194.24s)]
*  And he's like 50. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4194.72s)]
*  Is that just weird? [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4196.0s)]
*  Is that creepy or is that like- [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4197.92s)]
*  No. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4200.0s)]
*  It's- [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4200.240000000001s)]
*  No. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4200.400000000001s)]
*  Or you're like- [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4200.64s)]
*  Here's an important distinction, it's legal. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4201.280000000001s)]
*  No, no, but that's what I'm saying. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4203.4400000000005s)]
*  I think that's kind of the same thing with Drake. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4204.72s)]
*  Like we've never heard that Drake dated- [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4207.280000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4209.04s)]
*  That's why it's bullshit. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4209.6s)]
*  I mean, it's a great assault. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4210.72s)]
*  Like if you really want to just make someone radioactive [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4212.240000000001s)]
*  and assassinate their character, it's a great thing to say. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4214.8s)]
*  Because the second you go, I'm not a pedophile, people are like, [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4217.280000000001s)]
*  I don't know now. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4221.280000000001s)]
*  You don't even want to defend yourself in the accusation. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4222.88s)]
*  No, you're right. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4224.72s)]
*  But this idea that like a guy who's 37 years old can't fuck a 20-year-old girl, [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4225.04s)]
*  get the fuck out of here. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4230.16s)]
*  Like at some point, they're women. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4231.5199999999995s)]
*  No. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4234.48s)]
*  At 20 years old, they go to war. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4234.8s)]
*  That's a 20-year-old, they say 20-year-old. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4237.36s)]
*  Bro, bro, bro, bro. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4238.4s)]
*  They're not even joking. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4239.04s)]
*  At 18 or 19, they're going to war. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4239.92s)]
*  They're driving a drone. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4244.16s)]
*  Yeah, they got OnlyFans. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4245.5199999999995s)]
*  They got OnlyFans? [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4246.48s)]
*  Like, no, no, dead ass. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4247.92s)]
*  That's the first thing. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4249.44s)]
*  All these people that are like, oh my God, how dare you have sex with a 21-year-old girl? [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4251.12s)]
*  Who you think you jerking off to, weirdo? [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4254.639999999999s)]
*  When you go watch porn, you're not going, well, is this girl 25 years old? [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4256.8s)]
*  Every one of them bitches is fucking 19 or 20 years old. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4259.92s)]
*  No, I only watch granny porn for that reason. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4262.8s)]
*  Yo, in reality, so I'm with you. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4265.12s)]
*  I'm with you, right? [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4267.12s)]
*  And that's why- [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4267.84s)]
*  What I'm saying is stop. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4268.88s)]
*  What they're trying to do is move the goalpost. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4269.84s)]
*  You know what's weird? [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4272.0s)]
*  Underage girls, that's weird you should be in prison. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4273.2s)]
*  That's not even like joke around about shit. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4275.5199999999995s)]
*  If that is even like, that is jail. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4277.84s)]
*  Take the nuts away. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4281.2s)]
*  20-year-old girls? [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4282.96s)]
*  What are we talking about here? [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4283.84s)]
*  When Leonardo Caprio is banging these 20-year-old girls, [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4285.76s)]
*  it's like he's not banging 20-year-old girls. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4288.72s)]
*  He's banging supermodels that happen to be 20. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4290.08s)]
*  His first thing is supermodel and they're 20. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4295.04s)]
*  I'm curious, but do you think it's a little weird? [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4298.08s)]
*  Because I know you saw the video about the groom and stuff. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4300.32s)]
*  Of course, when you just compile every single story and put it back to back to back, [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4302.96s)]
*  it's going to- [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4306.64s)]
*  It doesn't even make any- [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4307.360000000001s)]
*  They did this shit with the guy who directed Guardians of the Galaxy. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4308.72s)]
*  And this is why this shit- [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4311.52s)]
*  This is why this shit fucked up. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4312.8s)]
*  You remember the guy, was that his name? [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4313.68s)]
*  What's the director's name? [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4315.84s)]
*  Gun? [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4316.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4317.52s)]
*  James Gunn. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4318.240000000001s)]
*  And it got him kicked out of fucking Marvel. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4319.120000000001s)]
*  And what they basically did, this is during like cancel culture, [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4321.280000000001s)]
*  he had a bunch of like pedophile jokes. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4323.92s)]
*  And he was like making these like dark twisted jokes about like [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4327.68s)]
*  something about like having sex with kids or something like that. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4331.120000000001s)]
*  But they're like obviously fucking jokes. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4333.120000000001s)]
*  And what someone did is they collected all of them- [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4335.28s)]
*  Own compiles. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4337.36s)]
*  From different years in his life and put them on one page. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4337.76s)]
*  And when you have 10 different things from different years in your life, [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4340.72s)]
*  they're on one page, you're like, oh, that motherfucker is a creep. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4343.76s)]
*  And they fired his ass. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4346.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. So now if you're in a battle with somebody and you [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4347.679999999999s)]
*  can compile all these 10 different things and put it in a battle, [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4350.4s)]
*  I mean, it might sound good. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4352.8s)]
*  No, so there's two things going on. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4353.5199999999995s)]
*  One is, is it an effective strategy? [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4354.72s)]
*  Incredibly effective. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4356.8s)]
*  The other thing is, is it indicative of that person having a problem? [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4358.08s)]
*  Which I'm saying is no. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4362.5599999999995s)]
*  I think it's incredibly effective from Kendrick. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4364.0s)]
*  But does it make that person a pedophile? [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4366.4s)]
*  No. Is James Gunn a pedophile? [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4369.44s)]
*  No. That's why he's now working. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4370.8s)]
*  He fucking runs DC and they actually brought him back to do The Last Guardians. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4372.08s)]
*  You know, it's a little odd. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4376.32s)]
*  Like a lot of these guys who used to be frequent collaborators, [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4378.0s)]
*  they used to party with them. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4381.44s)]
*  They're kind of- they're either same like- even like Rick Ross. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4382.32s)]
*  I know they're not seen eye to eye right now, but it's like, [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4385.44s)]
*  if me and you used to party and have a bunch of girls around us, [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4388.24s)]
*  if later on I'm like, you like kids, [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4391.52s)]
*  that makes me look kind of crazy too. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4394.08s)]
*  So exactly. It's like, oh, so you was cool with them when everything was going on. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4396.16s)]
*  It's the same shit with Diddy. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4399.52s)]
*  It's like- [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4400.56s)]
*  No, no, no. We can't just throw Diddy and Drake in the same- [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4401.44s)]
*  Pop. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4403.44s)]
*  You're right about that. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4406.96s)]
*  I see the video today- [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4407.84s)]
*  That's more saying people are quiet about Diddy, but they're loud about Drake. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4409.04s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4411.6s)]
*  But it's like y'all been to Diddy parties. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4412.0s)]
*  No, I see the video today that fucked me up a little bit. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4413.6s)]
*  What was it? [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4416.32s)]
*  Just because it now gets me to think, is there something I don't know? [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4417.2s)]
*  About whom? [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4423.12s)]
*  Well, not necessarily Drake, but so is your peer, Shane- [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4424.72s)]
*  Shane Gillis. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4430.56s)]
*  Yes, he has a podcast. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4431.28s)]
*  Hilarious, yes. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4432.0s)]
*  There's a clip- [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4434.16s)]
*  New show out on Netflix, Tires. Go watch Tires. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4434.88s)]
*  Oh yeah, the premieres of the Netflix. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4437.36s)]
*  There's a 2019, I guess he does podcasts, he had 2019, him and his guy, who is his co-host, [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4438.32s)]
*  I guess, are on the podcast and he randomly comes out, you know, Aaron and I dug it up. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4444.4s)]
*  Randomly 2019, he comes out, they're talking about Epstein, then R. Kelly, and he says, [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4449.04s)]
*  I'm gonna just say this right now, in five years, they're getting Drake. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4454.4s)]
*  And like, he kind of like, it's not even like a joke where he starts to kind of, he's like, [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4458.16s)]
*  yo, that's the word out about this guy. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4463.28s)]
*  And that made me a little bit uneasy because I was like- [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4465.92s)]
*  Because the two white guys from rural Pennsylvania might know something about hip hop that you don't know? [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4469.44s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4474.32s)]
*  This is the thing about narratives, it's like, you know how far you gotta grasp at straws? [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4474.88s)]
*  Well, that's what people know. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4479.679999999999s)]
*  For the two whitest human beings on the planet to tell you something about a hip hop star that you speak to regularly? [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4480.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but I don't know these people's personal lives. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4488.639999999999s)]
*  I really wouldn't know. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4490.32s)]
*  I really wouldn't know what they're into sexually, I wouldn't know. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4491.5199999999995s)]
*  You know what's so funny? [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4493.919999999999s)]
*  This is hilarious. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4495.28s)]
*  Anytime white people talk about hip hop, it's stay out of our culture. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4496.16s)]
*  The second they start calling Drake a pedophile, they're like, yo, they might be on this side of the field. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4499.599999999999s)]
*  They might know some shit we don't know, yo. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4503.839999999999s)]
*  I'm not saying no. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4505.759999999999s)]
*  I definitely am not saying I believe it. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4506.879999999999s)]
*  I think you team OVO, bro. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4508.32s)]
*  No, I ain't team OVO. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4509.759999999999s)]
*  I mean, team XO. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4510.719999999999s)]
*  Too many motherfucking acronyms or whatever. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4511.759999999999s)]
*  I think you team XO. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4514.4s)]
*  TDE. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4515.84s)]
*  Me personally, me personally. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4516.96s)]
*  TDE. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4518.24s)]
*  No, XO too. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4518.799999999999s)]
*  Me personally, and I think this is probably the dangers of kind of like probably navigating the game, [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4521.599999999999s)]
*  like how Drake has done to get to the top, is that I don't think Drake necessarily is following a, [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4527.04s)]
*  to your point, high school female basketball player for some weird shit. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4534.8s)]
*  I don't. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4539.360000000001s)]
*  What I do think is that Drake knows how to stay next to the heat. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4540.16s)]
*  I guarantee he follows speed. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4545.28s)]
*  Who's a 16? [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4546.8s)]
*  He's probably 18 now. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4548.72s)]
*  But when he start popping off, he's a 16 year old streamer. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4549.84s)]
*  He's probably DMing him stuff. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4552.96s)]
*  Like you got to realize like Drake knows, Drake realizes his lifespan also requires him to be current, [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4554.64s)]
*  staying next to other people who are affecting culture in that generation. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4562.96s)]
*  Put them on. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4567.52s)]
*  And the only thing that, again, we've never seen a sexual message. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4568.16s)]
*  Like it's one thing he's like, yo, send me a nude. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4572.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4575.84s)]
*  Like, you know what I mean? [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4576.4800000000005s)]
*  If that was the, if the interactions were that, I'd be like, okay, that's crazy. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4578.0s)]
*  But just because he's, he's going to follow, if a child star gets 30 million followers right now, [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4584.4800000000005s)]
*  he's going to follow that person. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4589.36s)]
*  Yo, you're great. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4590.56s)]
*  Yo, you're great. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4591.44s)]
*  Oh, come to one of my shows. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4592.48s)]
*  Like I'm pretty sure he's not like, yo, come to the after party and then the ditty party. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4593.5199999999995s)]
*  We about to do, but the fact that we're having this discussion is why it's so effective. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4596.719999999999s)]
*  Has anyone accused him? [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4601.12s)]
*  Has anyone come out and been like, no, all the women have actually came out to say, [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4602.08s)]
*  yo, when I took a picture with them, what, like nothing happened. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4605.759999999999s)]
*  That was the only interaction. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4609.12s)]
*  Nothing else ever happened. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4610.879999999999s)]
*  He's too shrewd. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4612.08s)]
*  Like I can't, someone who has navigated the game this well to be where he is. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4613.04s)]
*  I can't imagine him just fucking up in the fucking DMS or something like that. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4617.04s)]
*  It's like, hey, get out of here. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4620.799999999999s)]
*  Now him having a daughter on the side, if you already got one, it's possible to have another. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4622.24s)]
*  Like to me, that even if it's bullshit, it's more believable than this other thing. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4628.16s)]
*  And by the way, I feel what's happening to Drake is kind of the inevitability of like that quote, [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4632.88s)]
*  and this is why it's like so, it's so opposite of what's going on with Kendrick. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4641.92s)]
*  It's like the fresh and fish thing where it's like, yo, I'm just fucking a bunch of chicks. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4646.24s)]
*  Like if Drake still isn't dating another chick, a new chick every two weeks, this doesn't happen. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4649.36s)]
*  Right? [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4654.4s)]
*  Like if Drake had settled down and like literally isn't doing the things, [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4655.04s)]
*  which by the way help furthers his career. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4659.2s)]
*  I'm always going to be with the new hot chick. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4660.88s)]
*  I'm court side every game. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4662.639999999999s)]
*  I'm popping out like the biggest artist should. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4664.08s)]
*  He probably doesn't have these type of things. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4667.12s)]
*  This is why the battle with him and Kendrick is a little bit unfair, right? [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4669.12s)]
*  Kendrick's a really boring guy that stays home with his wife. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4671.679999999999s)]
*  All right, guys, we're going to take a break real quick so I can help you make the biggest [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4674.0s)]

*  Only miscalculation in this entire thing for me, for Drake, was to actually give Kendrick a whole song. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4834.0s)]
*  With all due respect to the musical genius and talent that is Kendrick. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4841.84s)]
*  And again, I'm a casual. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4846.240000000001s)]
*  No one gives a fuck about him. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4848.8s)]
*  Meaning, I don't know his hobbies. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4851.84s)]
*  I don't know his interests. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4854.64s)]

*  I don't know if he's in a poker tournament. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4859.6s)]
*  I don't know anything about Kendrick. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4862.16s)]
*  Coming from somebody who just did a roast. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4864.72s)]
*  The most effective way to roast people. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4867.6s)]
*  Like, I didn't talk about the comedians almost at all. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4870.64s)]
*  Because nobody knows them compared to the athletes who are there. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4873.04s)]
*  I'm just shooting at the athletes and the famous people there. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4876.64s)]
*  I wish I knew Kim was there. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4879.360000000001s)]
*  Because she's the most famous person in the room. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4880.8s)]
*  That joke shouldn't go crazy. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4882.96s)]
*  Everybody knows every detail about Drake. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4885.12s)]
*  We know where he vacations. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4887.280000000001s)]

*  Because Drake be outside. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4893.84s)]
*  Kendrick's inside. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4894.88s)]
*  It's not that people don't care. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4895.84s)]
*  It's just that he doesn't give people anything to go off of. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4896.88s)]
*  He's a private person. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4900.4800000000005s)]
*  My whole point was that Drake's lifestyle has created this. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4903.68s)]
*  Like, no one is at this point. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4906.5599999999995s)]
*  Like, Rihanna disappeared. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4909.2s)]
*  Sure, sure. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4910.5599999999995s)]
*  Jay-Z at this point was like so secluded. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4911.2s)]
*  Drake is still living like the 25-year-old, I just got fat. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4914.08s)]
*  Hold on, hold on. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4917.44s)]
*  The separation that I would say is, Kendrick is known for his music and only his music. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4918.5599999999995s)]
*  Drake is known for the personality and celebrity that is Drake. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4926.48s)]
*  Yes. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4931.759999999999s)]
*  And his music. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4932.639999999999s)]
*  And the personality and celebrity that is Drake allows you to take so many more shots in this [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4934.56s)]
*  battle. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4940.88s)]
*  There's so much more information that's out there. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4941.52s)]
*  Drake got to explain to us shit about Kendrick that he's making fun of. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4944.96s)]
*  Like, I don't know. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4949.360000000001s)]
*  Like, I kind of lost interest in the battle because I don't know enough about Kendrick. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4950.08s)]
*  Like, I'm like, I think he's very talented. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4954.4800000000005s)]
*  Why is he like, wait, they're not looking together? [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4957.2s)]
*  Where do they even live? [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4959.04s)]
*  He has a wife. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4959.76s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4960.400000000001s)]
*  He has a kid. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4960.72s)]
*  Like, what is going on? [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4961.4400000000005s)]
*  True to your point. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4962.64s)]
*  Who's Dave Free? [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4964.24s)]
*  I never. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4965.28s)]
*  I don't even know the people that you're making fun of him for. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4965.92s)]
*  You got to give me a Wikipedia of this guy before you battle him? [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4970.0s)]
*  Well, here's the thing, too, though. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4974.88s)]
*  I argue, so if we're looking at levels in popularity, I would have Kendrick. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4976.719999999999s)]
*  In music, they're close. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4981.5199999999995s)]
*  Get out of here. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4983.28s)]
*  No, music. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4983.759999999999s)]
*  Music-wise, they're close. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4984.96s)]
*  You're too close. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4986.08s)]
*  You're too close. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4986.639999999999s)]
*  No, no, hold on. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4987.2s)]
*  That's his point. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4987.759999999999s)]
*  He's saying in music. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4988.48s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4989.44s)]
*  In music, they're close. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4990.32s)]
*  Just in the world, they're not. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4992.0s)]
*  You're saying in terms of music popularity or in the music world? [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4994.0s)]
*  No. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4998.0s)]
*  In the music world. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4998.24s)]
*  Music pop- listen. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=4998.96s)]
*  Define popularity. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5001.2s)]
*  Because I- [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5002.08s)]
*  Well, I'll do that on consumption. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5002.5599999999995s)]
*  So if Drake drops- [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5004.799999999999s)]
*  You think Drake and Kendrick have been consumed the same amount? [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5005.84s)]
*  In close amounts. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5010.48s)]
*  Drake's still more popular, but Kendrick was never that far behind. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5011.36s)]
*  I don't think it's in the same stratosphere. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5015.36s)]
*  I mean, the numbers are there. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5018.48s)]
*  You're a cash- [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5019.919999999999s)]
*  No, no, but- [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5020.4s)]
*  The numbers are there. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5021.2s)]
*  No, no, no, no, but Drake drops way more, so of course he's going to stream a lot higher. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5022.24s)]
*  Like, even now? [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5025.28s)]
*  Yo, even now? [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5026.0s)]
*  I don't think Kendrick can do it for the Drake has done internationally. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5026.48s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5029.839999999999s)]
*  You answer this question. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5030.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't think Kendrick has an international draw like Drake does. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5031.36s)]
*  I don't even think it's close. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5033.919999999999s)]
*  Okay, well, you answer this question now. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5035.2s)]
*  But no, real quick. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5036.48s)]
*  Let's just address that. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5037.2s)]
*  Because what you're talking about is popularity, right? [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5038.08s)]
*  No, I would say music- [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5040.32s)]
*  In the music. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5041.5199999999995s)]
*  In specific forms. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5042.24s)]
*  In music consumption, when Kendrick drops an album and Drake drops an album, [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5042.879999999999s)]
*  if it's 100 people that are going to go check out Drake, 75 to 80 will also check out Kendrick. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5047.360000000001s)]
*  And that's just the reality of just music. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5055.76s)]
*  Well, let's get data on this. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5058.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm going to be honest with you, Kendrick Lamar, he is the second most consumed person. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5059.76s)]
*  We can't act like this is some bum. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5066.72s)]
*  You know, Drake is wildly more popular. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5068.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5071.360000000001s)]
*  And by the way, Drake knew this coming into it. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5071.68s)]
*  You have more to lose than to gain. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5074.8s)]
*  So it seemed close. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5077.04s)]
*  So Kendrick outsold Drake in the last tour, and then Drake's most recent tour outsold Kendrick. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5077.76s)]
*  So it seems like it's the two of them going back to the point where it's racking. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5083.360000000001s)]
*  Drake outsold Kendrick Lamar in just 30 of the 72 shows he did this year. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5086.0s)]
*  Yeah, but then the year before that, Kendrick outsold Drake. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5090.96s)]
*  So this tour is huge for Drake. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5092.96s)]
*  So the point is, he's saying Drake is bigger, but it's not a crazy gap, [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5094.56s)]
*  which seems to stand by every metric. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5098.72s)]
*  Just only within music. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5101.12s)]
*  This grossed $129 million, and I think Kendrick's was $110 million. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5103.04s)]
*  So it was relatively close. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5108.4s)]
*  That's way closer than I thought. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5109.5199999999995s)]
*  When Drake comes to New York, well, shit, he's been on a tour run. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5111.92s)]
*  He did New York venues probably about six, seven times, and Kendrick did about three or four. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5116.639999999999s)]
*  Again, definitely way more, but... [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5123.679999999999s)]
*  It's twice as much. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5126.4s)]
*  Well, we're still in the same punching league. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5128.24s)]
*  You get what I mean? [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5131.44s)]
*  Twice as much as not to me. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5132.48s)]
*  Compared to other acts in hip hop, yes, you're sizably bigger than me, [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5135.12s)]
*  but I'm still in the same realm. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5141.2s)]
*  I'm still in that same realm, which matters. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5143.76s)]
*  That's what's going to force Drake to respond, right? [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5148.16s)]
*  Hey, you have literally the number two guy calling you out. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5150.96s)]
*  Now, I do agree with you to some point where [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5154.4s)]
*  he didn't necessarily have to drop a standalone diss song. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5157.36s)]
*  He could have just said, hey, I'm going to wait. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5161.200000000001s)]
*  Just like how you dropped a diss to me on a hit song like that. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5163.4400000000005s)]
*  Next time I'm going to DJ Khaled, so I'm going to diss the shit out of you. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5167.4400000000005s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5170.4800000000005s)]
*  It only benefits him. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5171.84s)]
*  It only benefits Kendrick. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5173.6s)]
*  Because people say Drake took the L with Pusha because he didn't respond. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5174.88s)]
*  If Kendrick made a whole song, a six and a half minute song... [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5179.92s)]
*  No, you would have to do that. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5183.04s)]
*  Like that was not that. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5184.320000000001s)]
*  Like that was a feature. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5185.52s)]
*  No, no, I know, but then Kendrick dropped. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5186.8s)]
*  No, Kendrick wouldn't drop that. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5189.36s)]
*  No, you're talking about... [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5190.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, so you don't think Drake should have dropped at all, [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5191.5199999999995s)]
*  responded to like that at all? [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5194.4s)]
*  That's not what I'm saying. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5195.92s)]
*  What I'm saying is he should have done it in a song not given Kendrick. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5196.8s)]
*  He should have gone first. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5201.36s)]
*  But he did. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5202.16s)]
*  He did Pusha and he shot at everybody. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5202.8s)]
*  He sang, oh, it's just a pusha. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5204.5599999999995s)]
*  It wasn't just a Drake. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5205.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, but it's a standalone diss. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5206.639999999999s)]
*  It's not even meant to be a single. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5208.24s)]
*  I think this proved to me that Drake is completely done with being... [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5210.88s)]
*  He's completely done with rap battles. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5214.639999999999s)]
*  He can't do it anymore. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5216.24s)]
*  And it's not because of ability, but because of where he is. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5217.68s)]
*  You see, you know, what's happening now, and I was talking about even the numbers, [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5221.200000000001s)]
*  Kendrick Lamar's numbers, like he's about to go number one next week with the new song. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5224.72s)]
*  He just dropped the Drake. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5228.240000000001s)]
*  He's going number one in the country. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5229.360000000001s)]
*  And you're going to give this guy his first number one of his number one solo record of [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5231.360000000001s)]
*  his whole career because you engaged with him. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5237.04s)]
*  Two things is happening. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5240.08s)]
*  Kendrick has never had a number one record. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5241.200000000001s)]
*  A solo, solo. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5243.04s)]
*  He's never had a number one solo record. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5244.240000000001s)]
*  And you're saying that he's on the same level as Drake? [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5245.6s)]
*  You guys are saying that? [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5248.56s)]
*  He's had number one records. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5249.4400000000005s)]
*  It just hasn't been a solo record. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5250.56s)]
*  But I'm saying, are you making the argument that someone who's never had a number one [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5252.72s)]
*  solo record is the same, is on the same level in music popularity as Drake? [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5256.320000000001s)]
*  Is that the argument you guys are standing on tonight? [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5261.76s)]
*  Well, Drake has a handful of solos. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5264.08s)]
*  I just want to know if we're lying. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5264.88s)]
*  Are we going to lie to Drake? [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5266.0s)]
*  Well, Drake has a handful of solos. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5267.280000000001s)]
*  Are we just going to sit on the couch and lie to each other? [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5268.160000000001s)]
*  Well, hold on. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5269.92s)]
*  Do we lie for funsies or do we just acknowledge the reality? [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5271.360000000001s)]
*  What do we do? [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5275.28s)]
*  Drake has a handful of solo records that became number one, but not as much as you might think. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5276.24s)]
*  A lot of his are also features or someone else is on the song as well. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5281.44s)]
*  We have to be realistic. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5285.28s)]
*  This is not like, you know, this is not Big Taylor, okay? [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5286.24s)]
*  What I'm saying is it took Drake for Kendrick to get his first number one. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5289.5199999999995s)]
*  By the way, up until Hotline Blink. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5294.24s)]
*  Think about that. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5295.28s)]
*  It wasn't even Hotline Blink. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5296.08s)]
*  It's not a feature, but it is. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5296.88s)]
*  It wasn't Hotline Blink because I think that went number two. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5297.759999999999s)]
*  Remember, Drake never had a number one as a lead artist for a while. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5300.400000000001s)]
*  Like, I remember when he wrote that long-ass paragraph and at that time, everyone thought [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5305.6s)]
*  not only was he the biggest in the culture, they thought he was one of the biggest in the world. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5310.0s)]
*  But obviously things change in how. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5313.84s)]
*  Keep in mind, I'm not talking about the culture. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5316.240000000001s)]
*  I'm talking about just the world. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5318.400000000001s)]
*  I think Drake is more accessible. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5320.08s)]
*  The things that he's rapping about are more accessible internationally. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5322.0s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5325.52s)]
*  Than the things Kendrick are rapping about. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5325.84s)]
*  Because of that, he'll have more success internationally and then those numbers will [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5327.44s)]
*  just be bigger. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5330.8s)]
*  If Kendrick is talking about personal, experiential, cultural trauma that exists in the black community [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5331.759999999999s)]
*  in America, what is some fucking Swedish guy going to listen to that and understand what's [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5337.599999999999s)]
*  going on? [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5342.16s)]
*  You're also using a metric that no one cares about, right? [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5342.32s)]
*  You see, when we report sales and as MediaPage reports sales, we don't care about anything [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5344.16s)]
*  but US sales. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5350.0s)]
*  There's a global sales, which obviously goes to, it's still money. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5351.04s)]
*  They're still getting paid from that data. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5354.4s)]
*  But usually what happens in the US kind of goes into the rest of the world. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5356.400000000001s)]
*  Of course, certain artists don't focus on those markets, right? [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5361.68s)]
*  Drake is huge internationally compared to any of these guys by like a landslide. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5364.16s)]
*  Same with Taylor Swift. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5368.64s)]
*  Same with all superstars. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5370.08s)]
*  But the conversation that- [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5371.6s)]
*  You can't name a superstar that's not huge internationally. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5372.96s)]
*  But the conversation that Drake wants to affect is the one that happens usually stateside. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5375.4400000000005s)]
*  That's why he has to compete. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5380.88s)]
*  What I'm saying is that's the miscalculation. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5381.92s)]
*  In my opinion, I think that he was yearning for that approval. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5383.84s)]
*  It's a legacy thing. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5387.76s)]
*  I think it's insecurity. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5389.84s)]
*  I think it's like he wanted that validation. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5390.8s)]
*  And it's- [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5392.64s)]
*  So it's been an MC. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5392.96s)]
*  Every rapper that's always held that throne of not being the biggest rapper, [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5395.12s)]
*  but being the best rapper has always- [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5401.360000000001s)]
*  Not only- [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5405.12s)]
*  That's one of the things it's like, well, I'm going to trivialize it a little bit by saying [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5405.68s)]
*  Lebron in the Dunk Contest. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5410.08s)]
*  People were saying about Kendrick, we've never seen you in a battle. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5411.599999999999s)]
*  And every guy who was supposed to be the top guy, we've seen him battle tested. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5414.24s)]
*  Now Drake has already battle tested. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5417.92s)]
*  Sure, he lost to Pusha T, but we've seen him win many others. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5419.5199999999995s)]
*  He could have not- [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5422.719999999999s)]
*  He could have ducked this one. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5423.839999999999s)]
*  But people also were watching and saying, hey, don't tell me you handled Meek Mill when [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5425.36s)]
*  you knew you could body him. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5430.639999999999s)]
*  Pusha T, you didn't finish that one. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5432.32s)]
*  And the guy we really thought could beat you, [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5434.4s)]
*  it's like the Floyd argument when they thought he was ducking certain people. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5437.44s)]
*  Yes, that's where the ego comes in, but the MC comes in as well. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5440.88s)]
*  Let's go toe to toe. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5445.5199999999995s)]
*  Now, if I'm Drake, and I think this goes back to the point I was saying earlier, [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5446.5599999999995s)]
*  he no longer could do these because what we've realized in this battle is that [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5451.679999999999s)]
*  I told people that Drake was an underdog and that was asinine for a lot of people. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5456.88s)]
*  They're like, yo, he's the most popular rapper. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5460.0s)]
*  And I'm like, let me tell you this. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5461.759999999999s)]
*  There is a group of people that have came together. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5463.12s)]
*  These are the neutrals that they've came together and they're tired of the king raining. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5465.759999999999s)]
*  They came to see a beheaded. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5470.32s)]
*  They've came to see this. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5472.48s)]
*  What humans do. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5473.679999999999s)]
*  Humans do not like all this. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5474.5599999999995s)]
*  It's fine. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5476.88s)]
*  Let me just get this point out. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5477.92s)]
*  Humans oftentimes resent success. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5479.36s)]
*  It happened with Michael Jordan. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5481.92s)]
*  We all saw it. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5482.96s)]
*  I saw it as a Knicks fan. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5483.759999999999s)]
*  I was like, fuck Michael Jordan. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5484.96s)]
*  He was beating my team all the time. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5486.24s)]
*  He's not as good as Magic Johnson. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5487.36s)]
*  He's not as good Larry Bird. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5488.799999999999s)]
*  I wasn't even fucking alive with a magic Larry playing. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5490.0s)]
*  I just needed somebody else. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5492.24s)]
*  People said this about Michael Jackson. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5493.599999999999s)]
*  They're like, no, Prince. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5495.12s)]
*  This to me is closest to Michael Jackson and Prince in my opinion. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5496.719999999999s)]
*  Prince was incredibly talented, amazing musician, played all the instruments. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5500.32s)]
*  He is nowhere near Michael Jackson in terms of his success as an artist. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5504.639999999999s)]
*  But people needed an alternative. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5509.759999999999s)]
*  This is what happens when Karl Malone won the MVP. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5511.5199999999995s)]
*  It was just exhaustion of Jordan being so great and so amazing. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5514.88s)]
*  So what you need is you basically have this other person that you turn to. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5518.639999999999s)]
*  That's not to say Karl wasn't amazing. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5521.92s)]
*  It's not to say that Prince was amazing. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5523.36s)]
*  It's not to say that Kendrick is one of the most prolific artists that's ever existed. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5525.599999999999s)]
*  It's not discrediting them all. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5528.96s)]
*  But in terms of where Drake is in the world, [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5530.32s)]
*  people are going to look in other directions because humans naturally, [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5533.52s)]
*  we resent the success. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5536.4s)]
*  And I think we inflate sometimes other people that are not... [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5538.0s)]
*  Maybe we overinflate some people because of that resentment for the success. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5543.44s)]
*  Well, that's why I got led to this next point, which I've continually said. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5547.52s)]
*  I said, listen, the rules aren't the same for both artists. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5552.64s)]
*  When Kendrick drops like that, [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5557.52s)]
*  like that was a response to a song called First Versus Shooter. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5559.76s)]
*  He drops like that. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5563.360000000001s)]
*  Drake has never ducked a battle. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5565.200000000001s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5567.04s)]
*  He's always been there, right? [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5567.52s)]
*  Everyone's like, it's been like two weeks. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5570.160000000001s)]
*  Drake didn't say anything. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5572.400000000001s)]
*  You know what everyone says? [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5573.200000000001s)]
*  He's scared. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5574.160000000001s)]
*  This one's saying changing the rules. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5575.84s)]
*  Okay, Drake drops. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5577.200000000001s)]
*  It's two weeks now. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5578.56s)]
*  We're waiting for Kendrick. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5579.4400000000005s)]
*  Yo, chill out. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5581.04s)]
*  Yo, he just takes a while to cook. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5581.92s)]
*  What people think about both artists doing the same thing, [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5584.320000000001s)]
*  just taking time to create music. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5587.360000000001s)]
*  I thought Kendrick was ducking and I was annoyed at Kendrick. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5588.72s)]
*  And I'm a Drake hater, but I'm also not like a Kendrick slurper. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5590.96s)]
*  But also look at Kendrick put blatant lies on some of the records. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5596.240000000001s)]
*  To Drake too? [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5601.92s)]
*  Yes. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5602.96s)]
*  Well, Drake started it. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5603.6s)]
*  Yeah, we got to be honest. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5604.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's the other thing that's biased. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5605.6s)]
*  I feel like it's like... [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5607.120000000001s)]
*  I'm not sure Drake started it. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5608.240000000001s)]
*  To carry free shit? [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5609.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that came afterwards. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5611.2s)]
*  That came after the whole... [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5612.88s)]
*  You have a kid. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5614.96s)]
*  Okay, so what was the first... [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5616.639999999999s)]
*  So everything... [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5617.76s)]
*  No, push ups, he takes a sub chance. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5618.32s)]
*  Oh yeah, Whitney in the bodyguard. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5621.28s)]
*  No, that's a play off words. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5624.0s)]
*  Come on, bro. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5625.36s)]
*  Stop it. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5626.4s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5627.92s)]
*  I didn't know you compromised. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5629.2s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5630.16s)]
*  Oh, me hoe. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5630.719999999999s)]
*  I really didn't know you compromised. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5631.44s)]
*  Oh, you compromised, bro. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5633.12s)]
*  But Dave Free is not a bodyguard. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5634.5599999999995s)]
*  He wanted to just... [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5637.28s)]
*  That's what Drake does. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5638.24s)]
*  When Drake's getting at an opponent, he always... [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5640.08s)]
*  I think people figured it out by now. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5642.88s)]
*  Hey, you're going to get at my love interest. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5645.28s)]
*  And I think he instantly went there. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5648.08s)]
*  This is exactly what he did to Pusha T. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5650.88s)]
*  When Pusha T revealed that he had a son, he said, [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5653.68s)]
*  listen, something ring like Virginia... [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5657.04s)]
*  That was again before. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5659.76s)]
*  No, it was his wife. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5660.5599999999995s)]
*  That was again before. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5661.28s)]
*  Okay, but he didn't mention anything messy like, [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5662.24s)]
*  yo, your general manager is fucking your wife. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5665.28s)]
*  I mean, define messy. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5669.679999999999s)]
*  He's talking about someone's... [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5670.8s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5671.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5672.32s)]
*  But that wasn't... [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5672.639999999999s)]
*  Both of them kept their wives... [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5673.599999999999s)]
*  He didn't make an allegation at that point. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5674.4s)]
*  That's what I'm trying to say. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5675.5199999999995s)]
*  And this is what we... [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5676.16s)]
*  He just mentioned that. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5676.5599999999995s)]
*  He just mentioned that. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5677.12s)]
*  This is what we said earlier, off. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5677.44s)]
*  We were talking about the roast and mentioning like [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5679.36s)]
*  Tom Brady's kids and nobody mentioned his kids [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5681.28s)]
*  because these are people that are off camera. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5682.96s)]
*  When you take people that are off camera, [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5684.5599999999995s)]
*  off, they're out of the pub. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5686.32s)]
*  Push, Kendra, keep their wives out of it. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5688.48s)]
*  They don't put them in the public. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5691.12s)]
*  You put their name in there. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5692.639999999999s)]
*  Don't play, don't be like, whoa, where is this coming from? [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5694.4800000000005s)]
*  How dare you speak on my family? [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5696.96s)]
*  But you just, you mentioned my family's name in a battle. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5698.56s)]
*  You mentioned my family's name negatively. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5701.92s)]
*  It's not positive. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5703.52s)]
*  You're not saying, hey, all respect to her. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5704.400000000001s)]
*  I just don't like you. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5706.0s)]
*  And you mentioned it in innocence. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5706.8s)]
*  You mentioned it in civilians. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5708.16s)]
*  Once you mentioned civilians, you open it up. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5709.76s)]
*  You can't be upset when your civilians are... [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5711.92s)]
*  I agree. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5713.68s)]
*  And that's why I think Drake coming out of the push of tea battle, [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5714.32s)]
*  I think he said to himself, [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5718.08s)]
*  I wasn't comfortable with the fact that my family got exposed [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5719.6s)]
*  and the fact that I had a kid got exposed. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5723.28s)]
*  And my response would have went somewhere else. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5725.36s)]
*  So I'm going to bow out of this one. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5728.88s)]
*  And I think him coming in, [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5730.16s)]
*  if you listen to the energy on push-ups, [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5731.36s)]
*  he even says at the end, which even though it's a play on words, [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5733.5199999999995s)]
*  he's like, I'm trying to keep it PG, [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5735.759999999999s)]
*  but he's basically almost hinting like, [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5737.44s)]
*  I'm down to really get kind of in the mud with you [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5739.679999999999s)]
*  before I wasn't with push of tea. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5742.719999999999s)]
*  The only thing is, I don't think there's ever a response for someone saying, [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5744.4s)]
*  you fuck kids. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5749.36s)]
*  Like, you see, there's two things. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5750.5599999999995s)]
*  So if you don't ignore it, there's an elephant in the room. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5752.96s)]
*  If you respond to it, they're like, wait, about that. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5755.68s)]
*  Then they come up with all these loose narratives. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5759.599999999999s)]
*  Let's do this. You're right. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5761.44s)]
*  I'll concede that point. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5762.5599999999995s)]
*  I'll say that. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5763.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's fucked up. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5764.5599999999995s)]
*  You can paint that narrative. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5765.36s)]
*  Let's say all allegations are false on both sides. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5766.48s)]
*  Who's winning this battle? [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5770.0s)]
*  It's still Kendrick. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5771.36s)]
*  No. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5773.28s)]
*  Like that is bonkers. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5774.32s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5776.24s)]
*  I do like this not like us record. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5778.96s)]
*  All right. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5780.96s)]
*  Yeah, not like us. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5781.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, I like this record, but I'm going to be honest with you. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5782.4s)]
*  The majority of this battle before we got to this was Kendrick Lamar sitting back and saying, [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5786.88s)]
*  I'm going to pick you part as a man. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5792.8s)]
*  The very fabric of what you portray to be. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5794.8s)]
*  You're a whole fraud. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5797.28s)]
*  You've stolen culture. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5798.639999999999s)]
*  You're a bad parent. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5800.08s)]
*  You've made the same mistakes and you won't live up to responsibility. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5801.5199999999995s)]
*  These are things that like he was almost picking at the fabric of Drake and you're looking at him [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5805.6s)]
*  like, damn, maybe this guy's a fraud. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5810.64s)]
*  So now if it's just completely lies that you were. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5812.64s)]
*  I can't like Drake anymore, man. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5815.360000000001s)]
*  I really liked him because he was a good dad. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5816.72s)]
*  He's such a good father. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5822.400000000001s)]
*  He's a family man. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5823.6s)]
*  That's why I've been listening for 20 years. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5824.320000000001s)]
*  He fucks bitches. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5828.88s)]
*  Are you still fucking bitches and writing bars about it? [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5830.8s)]
*  You still go in the yacht in terms? [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5833.92s)]
*  I'll tell you this though. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5835.6s)]
*  It's aspirational living. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5836.64s)]
*  Culturally and this is what Kendrick has like on his side. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5838.4s)]
*  I know you're not going to say culturally. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5840.88s)]
*  That's what they were into. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5842.4s)]
*  Hey, as soon as he invoked like, yo, check this out. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5846.08s)]
*  This is what's authentic to hip hop. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5849.2s)]
*  And this guy, I'm going to paint him as, yo, he ran to future when he need the clubs. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5851.52s)]
*  He ran into this guy when he needed lingo. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5855.6s)]
*  He ran to this guy. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5857.28s)]
*  That was crazy. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5858.08s)]
*  Yeah, that then will make up because hip hop is still about authenticity. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5858.88s)]
*  To a certain extent. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5863.76s)]
*  And I think that's where Kendrick also, you know, Drake, you know, someone said this and [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5865.04s)]
*  I agree with him. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5869.4400000000005s)]
*  Drake probably should have just kept, yo, I'm going to just give you hit songs the whole way. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5870.08s)]
*  Let me not try to get into this whole. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5873.52s)]
*  Hip hop is not about authenticity anymore. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5875.280000000001s)]
*  Hip hop is who's the best liar. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5877.76s)]
*  Yes. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5881.360000000001s)]
*  Who's the authentic one? [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5884.4800000000005s)]
*  Hey, why most people are. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5885.68s)]
*  Maybe a young boy is rapping about killing people while he lives in a mountain. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5887.84s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here about authenticity. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5891.28s)]
*  Like, what are we talking about? [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5895.12s)]
*  But they still feel like that's authentic to a lifestyle that he subscribes to because [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5896.16s)]
*  when he came in the game, he had a suspended tenure sentence for shooting somebody in the [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5899.5199999999995s)]
*  neck. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5903.04s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5903.5199999999995s)]
*  It's like, OK, this is the type of guy that would do that, right? [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5903.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5907.04s)]
*  It's their authenticity still matters. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5907.36s)]
*  And I'm telling you, the reason why Kendrick is just like an impossible opponent, unless [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5910.08s)]
*  you prove that all this pro black shit he's been doing is fake and fraud. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5915.44s)]
*  Like, you know what I mean? [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5919.44s)]
*  Even then, nobody cares. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5920.4s)]
*  They would instantly tell you. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5921.44s)]
*  That's the only way if you had a record of him saying, man, fuck all this Black Lives [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5925.28s)]
*  Matter shit and all these niggas getting killed by cops. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5930.16s)]
*  I'm just trying to get a song off. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5932.16s)]
*  I'm telling you. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5934.08s)]
*  Yeah, where are you going to get that recording, though? [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5934.639999999999s)]
*  Shit. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5937.04s)]
*  I think he didn't plan to do the suitcases. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5937.759999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5940.24s)]
*  If he didn't expose it himself on steppers about him sleeping with white women, if Drake [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5940.799999999999s)]
*  was the one to expose that, Drake would have won. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5945.36s)]
*  Do you think that would have been? [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5947.2s)]
*  Oh, man, that would have been good. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5949.52s)]
*  That alone would have been the dagger. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5950.88s)]
*  That do you think Kendrick dropped that? [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5952.400000000001s)]
*  No. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5954.72s)]
*  And at some point, I'm going to I'm going to go at it with this guy. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5954.96s)]
*  And so I need to clean out the closet. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5957.92s)]
*  Let me get out in front of it. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5959.200000000001s)]
*  Could be. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5960.320000000001s)]
*  We should be fucking smart. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5960.8s)]
*  Or he just wanted his 444. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5961.52s)]
*  Not like us is the song of the summer. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5962.96s)]
*  L.A. is back. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5965.040000000001s)]
*  I don't listen to Joe Rogan anymore. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5965.84s)]
*  We should all move there. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5967.280000000001s)]
*  And trying to strike a chord is probably a minor is the it's a much more salacious thing. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5968.72s)]
*  But is that just in terms of like that line is going to stand out? [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5973.84s)]
*  Is that a world tour? [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5976.96s)]
*  Your girls tour? [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5978.080000000001s)]
*  That's this for this battle. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5979.12s)]
*  It's a fucking crazy. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5980.96s)]
*  Hey, listen, I have no idea how these songs were created, even though I know there was a pattern of [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5982.16s)]
*  I'm leading you guys to something in terms of Kendrick. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5988.5599999999995s)]
*  But I wonder if he had this song in the tuck the whole time. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5991.76s)]
*  Like this song is a bop. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5995.44s)]
*  I'll tell you, he's amazing at making. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5997.92s)]
*  Yo, he mentions family matters in the song. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=5999.84s)]
*  So either. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6002.8s)]
*  But you could also switch out like a line. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6004.08s)]
*  It leads you to believe either he had Drake does have the leak and he got family matters early [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6006.400000000001s)]
*  or he that motherfucker can microwave DJ head is wrong. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6011.4400000000005s)]
*  This motherfucker microwave food. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6015.12s)]
*  Fantastic. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6016.96s)]
*  Yo, I'm going to be honest with you. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6017.92s)]
*  Like he he played a mental game with Drake, a mental game of chess where he convinced Drake, [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6019.12s)]
*  yo, all them songs like push ups where you're just popping. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6025.76s)]
*  It's not going to work. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6028.64s)]
*  You're going to have to get cerebral with me. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6029.68s)]
*  So I think I'm going to do meet the grams. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6031.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm going to give like these niggas sound like jigsaw on the record. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6034.16s)]
*  Yo, really mean this. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6036.72s)]
*  Really mean that. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6037.5199999999995s)]
*  Hey, are you ready now to play? [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6039.92s)]
*  Have you ever like I'm like, what the fuck is this guy doing? [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6041.04s)]
*  And then all of a sudden when I'm thinking, all right, cool. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6043.44s)]
*  Like I'm ready to put my thinking hat on for the next joint. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6045.68s)]
*  He's like, fuck that. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6049.04s)]
*  We back in the club. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6049.92s)]
*  I'm like, what? [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6050.8s)]
*  It was brilliant. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6051.92s)]
*  The joint is fire. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6052.639999999999s)]
*  It's brilliant. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6053.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's a swan. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6054.16s)]
*  He's he's prolific. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6054.96s)]
*  And he's one of us is 2014. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6056.32s)]
*  Right. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6057.599999999999s)]
*  Do you feel like this started with control? [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6057.84s)]
*  These two have never really gotten along from control. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6059.68s)]
*  If you ask me, Kendrick always wanted to destroy Drake. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6064.48s)]
*  I think he doesn't like what he represents. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6070.0s)]
*  And that's why I say the cultural part matters. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6071.84s)]
*  Like there's a ilk of people like Kendrick that they believe he is the true, [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6074.24s)]
*  you know, not watered down MC that has gotten his proper flowers to a certain extent. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6079.28s)]
*  And then they look at Drake to say, oh, this guy used us. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6087.52s)]
*  He's a pop star parading around as a rapper. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6092.0s)]
*  And I think Drake's ego is like, motherfucker, I'm going to show you I'm a rapper. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6096.320000000001s)]
*  I'm going to show you I'm a rapper. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6100.080000000001s)]
*  I literally said this. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6102.56s)]
*  You guys disagree with you. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6103.4400000000005s)]
*  It's the insecurity. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6104.4800000000005s)]
*  He wanted to validate himself. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6105.76s)]
*  But that's what being a rapper is. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6107.200000000001s)]
*  We agree with that part. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6109.4400000000005s)]
*  I need to prove to you guys. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6110.160000000001s)]
*  I need to show you guys. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6110.88s)]
*  That's what being a rapper and MC is. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6112.72s)]
*  Being the best. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6114.320000000001s)]
*  You have to be the best. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6115.200000000001s)]
*  Like you got it. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6116.64s)]
*  Like another cool J went out with candidates. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6117.2s)]
*  That's it. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6120.48s)]
*  Hip hop has always been that. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6120.5599999999995s)]
*  If you have that rapper gene, like you're going to engage in some of these. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6123.12s)]
*  Fuck rappers. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6127.2s)]
*  Being a great if another comic remotely in the same stratosphere as you. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6127.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6131.12s)]
*  Started taking shots. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6131.44s)]
*  Fuck you. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6133.599999999999s)]
*  It's over. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6134.4s)]
*  It's over. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6135.36s)]
*  Jay-Z didn't have to call out Nas on Takeover. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6136.08s)]
*  Nas' career was already on the downturn, but he wanted that number one spot. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6138.32s)]
*  And people wouldn't give him that spot because he felt Nas rap better. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6142.24s)]
*  So he's like, nah, I'm a body. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6145.04s)]
*  This is what I've always loved about Kendrick. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6146.719999999999s)]
*  Even if the music wasn't for me, like Mr. Morales ain't for me. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6148.16s)]
*  But Control, when he stepped in the booth and was like, I want the crown openly. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6151.5199999999995s)]
*  All you guys, I love you. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6156.959999999999s)]
*  I'll kill you if I need to. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6158.0s)]
*  I was like, I fuck with that energy. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6159.36s)]
*  I just fuck with that energy all the way. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6161.04s)]
*  So we were all, I think, waiting on this for 10 years. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6162.959999999999s)]
*  And I think Kendrick- [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6165.5199999999995s)]
*  Hey, let's talk about the race factor and all this. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6166.32s)]
*  Because I think Drake is getting an unfair. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6168.639999999999s)]
*  Like, it's fucked up what they're doing to him because he helped so many artists [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6172.72s)]
*  become bigger, gave them their first number ones, gave them careers. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6177.92s)]
*  And now he's incredibly wack. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6181.120000000001s)]
*  And now he's looked at like, oh, he just used all these people for his advantage. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6183.04s)]
*  Incredibly wack. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6187.280000000001s)]
*  And also, this is, you know, they always say like- [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6188.160000000001s)]
*  But it don't, sorry to interrupt you. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6190.72s)]
*  It don't matter because with everything, first of all, nothing gets changed here. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6192.240000000001s)]
*  All the Kendrick fans, the Drake haters, they get satisfied by what Kendrick's done. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6198.72s)]
*  And then all the Drake fans, they either love what Drake did or they go, [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6203.76s)]
*  he lied so it doesn't count. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6208.320000000001s)]
*  Nobody moves at all. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6210.0s)]
*  Everybody just wants whatever they feel to be valid. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6211.280000000001s)]
*  I know you said that. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6213.92s)]
*  Everybody just wants whatever they feel to be valid. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6214.8s)]
*  It's no different than politics. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6216.4800000000005s)]
*  It's no different than that. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6217.360000000001s)]
*  We have the feeling already. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6217.92s)]
*  Everybody on the West Coast right now, where it's been a minute since the West Coast [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6219.280000000001s)]
*  really had like a real, I don't want to say that Kendrick wasn't a top guy, [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6222.08s)]
*  but it's been a while since the West Coast has dominated. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6225.92s)]
*  First time since the 90s. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6228.4s)]
*  In some sort of way. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6229.679999999999s)]
*  Everybody's fucking so excited by this. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6230.799999999999s)]
*  They're like, yo, we're back on top. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6232.799999999999s)]
*  We fucking got this. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6234.24s)]
*  We're the baddest motherfuckers. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6234.96s)]
*  So their egos are satisfied. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6236.0s)]
*  So obviously there's frustration, I'm sure, with Drake fans. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6237.92s)]
*  Like, man, we really want to just cover them and we didn't get this dub. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6241.04s)]
*  But I don't think everybody just leaves Drake as a Drake fan. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6243.679999999999s)]
*  They've built too long. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6246.24s)]
*  I don't think everybody, but you said it's like politics and swing voters [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6247.12s)]
*  is what decides the winner. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6250.879999999999s)]
*  Well said. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6252.16s)]
*  And right now- [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6252.639999999999s)]
*  Here's the thing that people don't realize about politics. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6253.12s)]
*  Swing voters still only vote based on their identity. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6255.2s)]
*  That identity hasn't really been swung. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6258.96s)]
*  It's just been moved from side to side. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6261.84s)]
*  So for example, the swing voter, like that middle America voter, that guy, [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6263.44s)]
*  if the Republican is saying we're open in the factory [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6268.88s)]
*  and the Democrats saying we're closed in the factory, they swing Republican. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6270.96s)]
*  If the Democrat is saying we're open in the factory, the public saying we're closed, [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6273.76s)]
*  they go Democrat. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6277.84s)]
*  What I'm saying is they're not real swing. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6278.72s)]
*  Nobody's going to change sides in this battle. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6281.5199999999995s)]
*  You just go towards whatever your identity wants. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6284.08s)]
*  And with those swing voters, as they call them, their identity does not change. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6288.160000000001s)]
*  They just go to whoever is going to fulfill their identity. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6292.96s)]
*  And the same thing happens in his- [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6295.360000000001s)]
*  We're just saying that now if somebody was going for that top spot, I'm the best. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6296.72s)]
*  So I think Kendrick has swayed people to give him that crown. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6300.88s)]
*  He got the crown right up. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6305.280000000001s)]
*  If both of them dropped an album this year, I think Kendrick would also. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6306.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's what's crazy. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6309.6s)]
*  He would have some first. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6311.52s)]
*  But I don't think it's over for him. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6312.48s)]
*  I don't think it's over for Drake. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6314.32s)]
*  Consumption right now is like people want to see Kendrick, [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6314.719999999999s)]
*  and it's going to be interesting when he does, [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6319.12s)]
*  they want to see him have the run with him finally having the crown. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6320.639999999999s)]
*  And Drake fans are not leaving. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6326.0s)]
*  Drake fans, he's still going to be the guy. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6329.12s)]
*  And that's why I think Drake should just be like, [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6331.36s)]
*  he should look at this and be like, wait, I fucked up in giving this guy his first solo number one. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6334.16s)]
*  And so many people are now on his side. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6340.16s)]
*  I hate saying shit and it takes y'all an hour to say it. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6343.2s)]
*  I really hate saying shit. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6345.92s)]
*  Is that what's happening now? [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6347.12s)]
*  I say shit, you go, you guys go, nah. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6348.24s)]
*  And then an hour later you just say it and I'm supposed to go, oh, you got a good point? [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6349.92s)]
*  No one actually discounted that. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6353.04s)]
*  We're saying that wasn't the full reason. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6355.36s)]
*  Drake still gave him a number one. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6358.0s)]
*  It's still a feature. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6359.92s)]
*  Of course. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6360.88s)]
*  It's a feature, bro. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6361.28s)]
*  No, no, of course. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6362.24s)]
*  Wait, if your number one comes off the dis-battle from the biggest guy, it's a feature. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6363.76s)]
*  I'm still acknowledging that. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6368.64s)]
*  What I was always saying is that this guy was always either 1A or 2. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6370.64s)]
*  He's phenomenal. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6375.68s)]
*  Again, that's why there's two different conversations. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6377.44s)]
*  One is like, is this guy musically prolific? [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6379.44s)]
*  Of course, he's amazing at making music. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6381.84s)]
*  He's amazing at rap. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6383.6s)]
*  I don't even think Drake would even utter the words he's bad at this. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6386.64s)]
*  I think the reason he's even beefing with him is because he goes, [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6391.12s)]
*  this guy's awesome at this. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6393.76s)]
*  I respect that. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6394.96s)]
*  I want people to know that I'm more awesome. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6395.52s)]
*  That's what he's doing. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6397.52s)]
*  Yeah, no, of course. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6398.080000000001s)]
*  To me, that's that insecurity. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6399.6s)]
*  It's like if he just knows he's more awesome and he has the validation of [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6400.8s)]
*  the people coming out to the shows, the fan base, the ticket sales, [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6404.88s)]
*  literally every metric except the fans of the other guy, which he'll never sway anyway. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6408.160000000001s)]
*  The fans of the other guy are never going to be swayed. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6413.68s)]
*  What I'm saying is it's a misstep based on what I perceive as, [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6415.6s)]
*  and we all have this as performers, [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6420.56s)]
*  we're like, I just want to win everybody over. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6422.0s)]
*  What if these people who don't like me- [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6423.76s)]
*  I think you look at it like a comic, but that's not what, [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6424.8s)]
*  like in hip hop, it's a really contact adversarial sport. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6426.96s)]
*  What I'm saying is you could do it without dedicating the whole song, [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6432.0s)]
*  which we agreed earlier, which is you just put out a banger [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6435.28s)]
*  that got a little few bars to Kendrick and then you make him put out the whole song first. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6438.16s)]
*  By you putting out the whole song first, I think it gives Kendrick- [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6444.16s)]
*  I always thought that. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6448.400000000001s)]
*  I always thought him going first. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6449.12s)]
*  But again, here's the thing too. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6451.4400000000005s)]
*  Kendrick has had the patience of waiting 10 years. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6453.6s)]
*  And Drake, like Drake told me something like, [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6456.88s)]
*  because he just went on like an 84 city tour. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6460.08s)]
*  He dropped three albums, went on 84. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6462.88s)]
*  Like the dude is exhausted, right? [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6464.400000000001s)]
*  Before he could go on vacation, this motherfucker dissed him. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6467.04s)]
*  He wants to get this over with now. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6469.84s)]
*  He just wants to do it now. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6470.96s)]
*  He's like, all right, you know what? [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6471.92s)]
*  Fucking I'm going to lock it, I'm going to get this done. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6472.72s)]
*  And Kendrick has the advantage of, [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6474.64s)]
*  I could just play the whack-a-mole thing and be like, all right, well, I'll be back later. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6478.08s)]
*  You know, and I think Drake cooked up something, [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6482.0s)]
*  but hoping to hear what Kendrick was going to come with. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6485.36s)]
*  And it was clear Kendrick wasn't going to drop again. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6487.84s)]
*  And he's just like, yo, what do I really got to do to make this guy rap? [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6490.5599999999995s)]
*  Like, you know, he's kind of posted on the gram like, yo, what's up? [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6495.28s)]
*  Any day now. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6499.04s)]
*  And he's like, fuck it. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6500.16s)]
*  I guess I have to start it off. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6501.36s)]
*  However, I think that played into Kendrick's strategy because he was counterpunching. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6502.5599999999995s)]
*  If we're thinking about it like, yo, I'm counterpunching. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6506.5599999999995s)]
*  It looks thirsty almost. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6508.48s)]
*  Okay, you're trying to hit me with the hit song with pushups? [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6510.320000000001s)]
*  Okay, bet. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6513.68s)]
*  Let me give you this layered song about how I'm about to just dissect everything that's going on. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6514.240000000001s)]
*  Then Drake is like, okay, all right, let me try to play your game a little bit. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6519.04s)]
*  And let me kind of cycle. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6523.92s)]
*  And oh, you're obsessed with these rumors because, oh, you were touched as a child. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6524.96s)]
*  I remember you said that on your song. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6528.96s)]
*  And he's now doing that. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6530.96s)]
*  And Kendrick's like, psych, I got a club hit too, motherfucker. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6532.320000000001s)]
*  So, strategically, Kendrick played. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6536.08s)]
*  Oh, strategically. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6539.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6540.16s)]
*  He is. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6540.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6540.96s)]
*  And Drake is a top tier chess player. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6541.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6544.72s)]
*  Also telling Drake. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6544.96s)]
*  Those little tidbits. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6546.48s)]
*  Yo, I have the van that's the replica, I guess it's a replica of that van that was on your first album cover. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6547.36s)]
*  I crushed it in my video. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6554.88s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6557.04s)]
*  The place you shout out from our city, New Hope King. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6558.48s)]
*  I'm in there just chilling, showing you that I'm the boss of this shit. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6561.36s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6564.32s)]
*  He's doing all these things against like, I always said, [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6564.8s)]
*  thank God that Meek Mill was so fucking stupid because that nigga was just playing like, [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6569.04s)]
*  yo, he was playing like bingo. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6574.719999999999s)]
*  Like Drake was just running circles around him. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6576.639999999999s)]
*  But he's going at a guy who's just a master chess player that you can't even see his moves anywhere else. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6579.44s)]
*  Like someone actually said this. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6588.0s)]
*  They said, hey, listen, Drake may have got a little bit of a big head, no did he, [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6589.599999999999s)]
*  because of the win over Meek. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6594.96s)]
*  And one of those things where it's just that Meek just madly and badly misplayed his hand. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6597.12s)]
*  Apparently he was like heavily on drugs at that time. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6602.24s)]
*  Yeah, but think about this, right? [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6604.4s)]
*  If Pusha T had Drake fall back with a rumor or not a confirmation of the child, [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6608.16s)]
*  well, what's the biggest like expose you could have had of a rapper to that time? [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6614.16s)]
*  It would have been you don't write your rhymes, except you know how he fumbled it? [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6620.72s)]
*  The nigga tweeted it out. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6624.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6625.92s)]
*  Three weeks before he made a song about it. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6626.32s)]
*  It's like if he revealed that on a song out of the blue, [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6628.32s)]
*  motherfucker you'll write your rhymes. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6632.799999999999s)]
*  And we're like, huh, what you talking about? [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6634.16s)]
*  Then just play the reference tracks. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6635.36s)]
*  We might look at that different. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6637.2s)]
*  And the song sucked. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6638.5599999999995s)]
*  All right, that's a prerequisite. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6642.24s)]
*  It becomes a little bit of a rapper. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6643.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6644.88s)]
*  We're just don't. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6645.759999999999s)]
*  You got to keep this real. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6646.5599999999995s)]
*  Did Drake feed him that information about the daughter? [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6647.84s)]
*  Because he's claiming that he fed him the information. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6652.08s)]
*  I don't think he did. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6654.32s)]
*  I think he's just claiming what the internet is saying. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6655.92s)]
*  The objective act. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6660.24s)]
*  I do believe the daughter thing. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6662.72s)]
*  I don't believe the other things. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6664.72s)]
*  So I didn't even know that that was up for debate. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6666.96s)]
*  I thought it was like fact that he that he fed the information. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6668.96s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6672.4800000000005s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6673.84s)]
*  I think the other thing your picture in the back of some fuzzy girl in the video saying, [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6675.52s)]
*  oh, this happens to be the same. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6680.0s)]
*  No, no, I think he did feed that because I could tell they were [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6681.04s)]
*  trying to recently feed like, you know, the other street dudes that usually hold down [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6685.12s)]
*  OVO in Toronto, they're getting tired of him. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6689.12s)]
*  He hasn't been feeding the wolves. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6691.44s)]
*  And I saw him randomly just beefing. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6693.04s)]
*  They're like, fuck OVO. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6694.72s)]
*  He had a time has changed now. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6696.08s)]
*  What's up? [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6697.5199999999995s)]
*  You know, you better put someone in the books. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6698.24s)]
*  I'm like, OK, you're trying to get them to feed into an angle. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6699.68s)]
*  And I think I said to Drake, I said, that was your boy still, man. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6702.8s)]
*  Like, I'm not buying that shit. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6707.36s)]
*  The one thing I don't think that was on stage was I do believe that his father [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6709.2s)]
*  probably went on vacation with some girl and the suitcase got stolen. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6714.16s)]
*  Because that doesn't why would you have prescriptions with your name and shit like that? [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6719.599999999999s)]
*  Like, you know, I mean, if you're trying to stage like, I think he did a good job on Family [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6726.0s)]
*  Matters to to own it to be like, hey, well, the Maybach glove was in there because of me and blah, [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6729.5199999999995s)]
*  blah, blah. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6736.16s)]
*  That doesn't make sense. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6736.639999999999s)]
*  I didn't even ask him about that, though. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6737.599999999999s)]
*  But then why did Kendrick remove the cover art? [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6740.24s)]
*  Well, I think it only got removed on Apple, I think. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6743.200000000001s)]
*  Well, yeah, you can't upload the DSP is like an actual medical script. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6746.240000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6750.240000000001s)]
*  It's like, yeah, it's like the guy's name and address is on it. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6750.72s)]
*  I still don't believe Drake fed him that because he would have said it right away. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6754.8s)]
*  Yeah, right away. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6759.04s)]
*  He'd have been like, hey, dummy, we fed you this information instead of being like, [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6759.84s)]
*  oh, I got a daughter. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6763.12s)]
*  Some nobody told me. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6763.92s)]
*  I believe he did because that is so random. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6766.160000000001s)]
*  If Kendrick had if he said it so confidently, he must have had it from some really reliable [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6769.76s)]
*  source that I feel that you know what all these guys are doing, right? [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6776.4s)]
*  Like they're sending their find out information like pushing. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6781.28s)]
*  They find out information on one another. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6785.04s)]
*  This is kind of fun. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6786.72s)]
*  Well, Pusha T said it. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6787.68s)]
*  Pusha T said everybody thinks that Kanye told me no. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6788.64s)]
*  For he said for he was talking to a girl. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6792.08s)]
*  They're all smashing the same girls. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6794.64s)]
*  What I say, they're all smashing the same girls. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6796.08s)]
*  A thousand girls get dicked down by all famous people. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6798.48s)]
*  I found out that I found out that Metro Boomin hated Drake before it was like universally known. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6800.719999999999s)]
*  I found that out because a chick he smashed in LA, I smashed in LA. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6808.5599999999995s)]
*  And you know, we're all talking and you know, nothing a girl always wants to impress you [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6814.08s)]
*  by flexing the other popping guy she's fucked with. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6819.12s)]
*  And they always just tell every detail. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6822.08s)]
*  So I'm like, oh, this is great. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6824.16s)]
*  Like, yeah, he hates to fuck out of Drake. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6825.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm like, oh shit. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6827.44s)]
*  But then the same thing kind of came up again where people heard that. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6828.48s)]
*  You find out why? [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6830.879999999999s)]
*  I still don't know why. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6832.5599999999995s)]
*  I just know that he doesn't fuck with her. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6834.16s)]
*  How do you know they're not using you? [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6835.44s)]
*  How do you know the girls aren't sent to smash you, pillow talk with you? [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6837.599999999999s)]
*  Have you ever thought that academics is working for me? [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6841.2s)]
*  No, no, no, because me and Metro don't get along. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6843.599999999999s)]
*  Me and Metro don't get along. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6846.5599999999995s)]
*  So I'm like. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6847.44s)]
*  What I'm saying is you could be doing stuff that you haven't realized that you're doing. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6847.839999999999s)]
*  Oh, no, no, no, that probably is. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6850.639999999999s)]
*  That probably is. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6851.839999999999s)]
*  This is a really convoluted game, which I realize I think future and Drake, [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6853.12s)]
*  they're beefing over women. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6859.04s)]
*  I think that's a really simple thing to kind of. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6860.56s)]
*  Why are they beefing over women? [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6862.08s)]
*  I'm like so like this is such a confusing notion that guys would beef over women that [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6863.68s)]
*  they're not even trying to wife. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6869.04s)]
*  I mean, it's not about the women, it's about the respect. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6871.12s)]
*  It's power and ego, though. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6872.72s)]
*  I think it's they're saying things to these women and then the women are saying stuff, [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6874.08s)]
*  relaying it back to the guys. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6877.76s)]
*  So it's like, oh, fuck with him. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6878.96s)]
*  It's not that we fuck same girls like, no, no, no, I know you don't like me because this girl talk. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6881.28s)]
*  Like a random girl that's I don't know if she fucks future, but she being around it when I [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6887.04s)]
*  was trying to figure out my kill, why haven't future and Drake been around each other like [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6891.2s)]
*  a girl who's like getting invited to these little parties that they do. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6896.0s)]
*  And, you know, they're around like fly on the wall type shit. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6899.599999999999s)]
*  What some of these conversations was like future like future was super pissed off that [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6902.88s)]
*  Drake did an album with 21 Savage. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6907.68s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6909.5199999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6910.24s)]
*  Why? Because they beef like crazy. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6910.48s)]
*  That's why I was a little confused because like he did an album with you. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6912.4s)]
*  But according to the person who I got it from, they were like, hey, [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6914.799999999999s)]
*  he felt that Drake used him at that time to have that cultural equity within the clubs in Atlanta. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6918.48s)]
*  Because the future used him to have the cultural equity within [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6925.5199999999995s)]
*  well, passes and everybody mutually benefits. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6929.839999999999s)]
*  If anybody future benefited more. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6932.08s)]
*  And what for them, they feel like, well, if you're going to come back to Atlanta [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6933.919999999999s)]
*  and do it with another rapper, it should be me. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6938.24s)]
*  That's what I've heard. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6941.12s)]
*  But there's probably like a bunch of nuances. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6942.32s)]
*  I'm like, so high school. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6944.719999999999s)]
*  I mean, I mean, it's really like high school. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6946.0s)]
*  All this shit. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6948.16s)]
*  Because most people who want to be famous are insecure, myself included. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6948.639999999999s)]
*  I'm not going to act like, you know, most of us try to work on it, but some don't. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6952.0s)]
*  And it's just especially if you're famous young, there's no need to work on yourself. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6955.12s)]
*  And there is some thought that, hey, some people just like the dudes fucking flying [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6958.799999999999s)]
*  around this bitch with a jumbo jet and got a 400 million dollar contract while these guys, [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6964.24s)]
*  they get 15 million, which is by the way, you know, you know, it's funny watching Drake and [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6968.4s)]
*  Rick Ross argue about money and Drake says to him, yo, yeah, this looks like a slice of cheese. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6973.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6979.2s)]
*  And he says like, you're being bearish as bitch. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6979.599999999999s)]
*  Like, basically, that's the guy who owns the spirits. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6982.4s)]
*  That Bel Air, Bel Air, all that. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6987.36s)]
*  And if you look at Ross, like Ross will be dissing everybody in the world with the bottles in his [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6990.0s)]
*  Oh, he's always come on. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6994.96s)]
*  So he's funny, dude. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6996.24s)]
*  Rick Ross is genuinely funny. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6997.44s)]
*  That was one of the times I thought Drake was going on script. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=6999.2s)]
*  I think he was losing what the people cared about. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7001.28s)]
*  Like we like funny shit. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7003.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7004.32s)]
*  And like, we're not going to be Rick on funny. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7004.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7006.24s)]
*  Rick saying white boy and BBL Dress. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7006.8s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7008.56s)]
*  Phenomenal. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7009.6s)]
*  And Drake had that misstep with the whole Tex and his mom thing. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7010.32s)]
*  Like that was corny. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7013.52s)]
*  What was that? [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7014.48s)]
*  What was that? [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7014.88s)]
*  Like he showed the screen shot. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7015.44s)]
*  Oh, mom, Rick is being racist or whatever. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7016.72s)]
*  Like even though it probably wasn't a real Tex and his mom, but the fact that he tried [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7019.84s)]
*  to put it out that way. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7023.04s)]
*  No, it was real. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7023.92s)]
*  Calling a guy racist. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7024.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7026.56s)]
*  Calling the guy racist that is going to use the fact that you're not in the culture [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7027.12s)]
*  and you're a white boy. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7031.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7031.84s)]
*  You're kind of proving it with that. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7032.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7033.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, I hear you. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7033.92s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7034.48s)]
*  Huge misstep. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7034.96s)]
*  As a white guy, I was like, that is kind of racist. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7036.0s)]
*  Kind of related to that the most of anything. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7039.2s)]
*  That was the best diss I've ever seen. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7040.88s)]
*  Hey, I think Drake should just, you know, just hit songs with us. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7042.8s)]
*  What's the next move? [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7047.12s)]
*  What is the next move for Drake? [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7048.24s)]
*  Hit songs way out of this. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7049.84s)]
*  Now hit song meaning about Kendrick or just about something else? [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7051.2s)]
*  Give them three lines here or there. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7054.96s)]
*  Still a bitch. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7056.96s)]
*  But a nice for what? [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7057.5199999999995s)]
*  A God's plan. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7058.48s)]
*  Yeah, I'm still bigger than you. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7059.2s)]
*  Hey, listen, you're the liar that, you know, I gave you a couple of weeks, but that's it. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7061.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7066.8s)]
*  Now here's the problem. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7067.12s)]
*  You put out, you try to put out the hit song, you try to do it, and then it flops or doesn't work. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7068.24s)]
*  That's bad. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7076.72s)]
*  That's bad. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7078.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7078.96s)]
*  Yeah, but you know what Drake does best? [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7079.6s)]
*  Do a collab. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7083.4400000000005s)]
*  Go to one of the guys, which is by the way, this is one of the most interesting parts I've been [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7085.04s)]
*  looking at. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7088.160000000001s)]
*  Who's the truth? [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7089.04s)]
*  Who's the truth? [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7089.68s)]
*  Who's the truth inside? [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7090.08s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7091.4400000000005s)]
*  I've seen people, I've seen a lot of artists who you could tell. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7091.92s)]
*  And that's what I was saying before, when you cut me off, I was saying with every billionaire, [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7097.200000000001s)]
*  they have this story of you fucked over like 10 people or you had to, right? [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7101.68s)]
*  I think Drake, what we're watching now, especially the silence. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7105.4400000000005s)]
*  Is a lot of people who not necessarily fucked over, but they might feel ever so slighted. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7110.56s)]
*  Yo, remember when I just came in the game and you hopped on my song and then I got a little [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7117.120000000001s)]
*  cool and I said, yo, could I, could you give me another verse and you left me on red motherfucker? [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7122.72s)]
*  But he already put you on. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7128.0s)]
*  This is where it's like, no, because we're also speculating. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7129.68s)]
*  In music, it's more of these genuine relationships, not where you're only [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7133.84s)]
*  fucking with me when it's convenient. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7138.48s)]
*  Those people become a little bit salty. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7140.08s)]
*  Like, yeah, I'm salty at you that you are, they feel essentially used even though it's really mutual. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7143.04s)]
*  Right? [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7149.759999999999s)]
*  It's not even mutual. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7150.08s)]
*  I mean, if you're an up and coming artist and then the biggest artist alive does a song with you, [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7150.959999999999s)]
*  the only person that benefits from that is the up and coming artist. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7154.959999999999s)]
*  And let me say this. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7158.08s)]
*  It's like. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7159.28s)]
*  Roddy Ricch, Roddy Ricch has had a song with Drake. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7160.08s)]
*  It got leaked. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7163.44s)]
*  It's called In A Cut. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7165.2s)]
*  The real song never came out. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7166.96s)]
*  Roddy Ricch, obviously, when he dropped the box with one of the most popular artists on the earth. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7169.44s)]
*  Afterwards, subsequently, his career kind of cooled out a bit. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7174.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7176.8s)]
*  He just had a song with Drake that just didn't come out, though. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7177.6s)]
*  I think he might feel away. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7180.88s)]
*  I think he might, you know, not like salty, but it's just like, you know, [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7182.16s)]
*  okay, I'm not in the same space I was when we cut that record and that got leaked and didn't come out. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7186.4s)]
*  Maybe you don't want to do another record. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7191.76s)]
*  Now, when I see Kendrick going at you, I'm a little bit more pro Kendrick. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7193.6s)]
*  He's now, yo, West Coast, Kro-D, you know what I mean? [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7197.12s)]
*  So I think Drake is watching and we can't really see any artists standing with Drake. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7200.96s)]
*  21 Savage, right? [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7204.64s)]
*  Just brought him on tour and the same third. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7206.08s)]
*  Of course, 21 fucks with Drake, but he's stuck between a rock and a hard place. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7207.6s)]
*  He's from Atlanta. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7213.28s)]
*  You can't go against Future. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7214.96s)]
*  Future is king in Atlanta. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7216.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7217.12s)]
*  I remember doing an interview with 21 and he told me, he said, [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7217.6s)]
*  yo, in Atlanta, Future is bigger than Drake. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7220.16s)]
*  Like the people of Atlanta care more about Future than Drake, right? [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7223.04s)]
*  So he can't go against Future. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7226.88s)]
*  And then his man is also Metro. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7229.36s)]
*  So he's like noticeably absent and quiet and Drake is kind of out here fighting by himself. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7231.28s)]
*  The second thing we've also not seen during the meat mill thing, when all that was going on, [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7237.28s)]
*  yo, Drake was popping up in Houston clubs, got bitches shaking their ass to back to back. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7242.0s)]
*  It looked like he was the culture. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7246.64s)]
*  Like he was what people were liking outside. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7250.0s)]
*  And I'm watching now, looked like Drake is stuck in the booth. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7252.64s)]
*  And even though we haven't seen Kendrick, his music seems to be outside. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7256.160000000001s)]
*  Everybody's dancing to the song. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7260.0s)]
*  Like the audition. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7261.360000000001s)]
*  I don't think he's stuck in the booth. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7262.96s)]
*  I think it looks at least Pierce, he's trying to keep the women on his side. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7264.240000000001s)]
*  Like he's popping up at Nikki shows. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7267.84s)]
*  He's popping up at Sexy Red shows. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7270.64s)]
*  Like not during the beef. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7273.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7274.8s)]
*  Recently he was on tour with Nikki. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7275.2s)]
*  Like not on tour, but he did like a few different dates with Nikki. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7276.5599999999995s)]
*  That's after he dropped push ups. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7279.679999999999s)]
*  Like shit got to another. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7281.679999999999s)]
*  Not since this next level. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7284.16s)]
*  That's when he's winning. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7286.4s)]
*  Since Kendrick responded. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7287.12s)]
*  Yo, I'm winning. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7287.599999999999s)]
*  Yo, when you're winning. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7288.16s)]
*  When I'm winning, I'm outside. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7289.28s)]
*  It's a good time when you win. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7291.12s)]
*  It's a real good time when you win. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7292.72s)]
*  And it's just odd how no one is speaking up for Drake. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7295.84s)]
*  I think so. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7300.48s)]
*  I want if I'm Drake, right? [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7301.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7302.32s)]
*  And I built, I built the way I orchestrated my career is instead of, [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7303.52s)]
*  and there are some artists that have done this, trying to shut down every new artist [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7310.080000000001s)]
*  that comes out out of fear that they're going to take them over. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7313.280000000001s)]
*  Like literally trying to like squash and silence careers instead going, [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7316.56s)]
*  I'm going to give you your first hit. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7320.080000000001s)]
*  I'm going to give you the first hit so that when you blow up, you remember me, [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7321.280000000001s)]
*  we can continue to work together and you always remember that, you know, [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7325.68s)]
*  we built something good and I'm going to put you on. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7328.8s)]
*  And maybe he really likes putting people on. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7331.12s)]
*  Maybe he's, I mean, like, I know there's, look, Joe Rogan likes putting on new talent. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7334.24s)]
*  He's done it with so many of us. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7338.32s)]
*  He enjoys it. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7339.84s)]
*  He doesn't ask for nothing back. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7340.64s)]
*  He literally just enjoys putting on people who are nice. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7342.24s)]
*  So maybe there's a part of Drake like that and he's done it with so many people. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7344.88s)]
*  Now, when Joe's going through anything, he got a lot of motherfuckers like me [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7348.72s)]
*  that are ready to start swinging because we know how important he was. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7353.68s)]
*  Same thing with Charlotte. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7357.6s)]
*  Charlotte going through anything. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7358.72s)]
*  I'm riding with Charlotte till the end of times. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7359.92s)]
*  So it's like, if there's anything that affects any of those guys, we're riding. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7362.96s)]
*  If I'm Drake right now, I would be kind of hurt that I put all these fucking people on, [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7370.4s)]
*  did all these songs with these people who are really, you could say, oh, they're popping. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7375.2s)]
*  They were no names in terms of international play before he puts them on. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7379.6s)]
*  Probably has made them through that millions and millions of dollars. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7384.8s)]
*  Right? [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7388.96s)]
*  I'm very vocal about the credit, you know, who I give credit to, the people who put me on. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7389.52s)]
*  Very vocal. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7393.68s)]
*  Right? [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7394.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm sure those people in some way must feel if they're like reasonable human beings. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7395.280000000001s)]
*  And then nobody talking, nobody speaking up. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7399.76s)]
*  I'd be tight, bro. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7402.320000000001s)]
*  Well, they don't want to go against the other side. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7403.68s)]
*  And also, this is what the other side do. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7405.76s)]
*  But that's what's great. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7408.240000000001s)]
*  Now you're playing politics. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7409.280000000001s)]
*  Well, here's the thing, too. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7410.4800000000005s)]
*  I think there's a lot of people in the industry that... [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7412.160000000001s)]
*  Resent that motherfucker. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7415.76s)]
*  No, but beyond that, [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7417.040000000001s)]
*  they have looked at Drake and they have really maybe seen a little bit behind the curtain [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7418.72s)]
*  and they respect him less now. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7425.280000000001s)]
*  What does that mean? [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7426.8s)]
*  There was a time when they felt that he was the instant I get on a verse, [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7427.84s)]
*  it's going crazy, it's going to affect shit. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7432.88s)]
*  Like, I think now people look at him and be like, well, what is Drake [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7435.76s)]
*  if he doesn't have a Yachty next to him? [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7440.4800000000005s)]
*  Or if he doesn't, he's not riding this wave. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7442.72s)]
*  They don't look at him as untouchable anymore. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7445.4400000000005s)]
*  Do you think it... [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7449.68s)]
*  I'm playing devil's advocate because again, I'm the Drake hater on the team. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7451.12s)]
*  Do you think it says something that none of those guys will go to Beth? [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7455.04s)]
*  Because there's nothing anybody could say about you to make me go, [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7458.64s)]
*  I believe you, I'm going to stay quiet. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7462.4800000000005s)]
*  I'll die for this guy. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7464.400000000001s)]
*  You'll die for... [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7465.84s)]
*  But that's the thing. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7466.56s)]
*  Is it not telling? [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7468.16s)]
*  I'm actually asking you, do you think it's telling that nobody's coming? [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7471.04s)]
*  Do you think that says something about Drake more than the people? [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7474.8s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7477.12s)]
*  Nobody. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7478.24s)]
*  Like, is every one of these guys shitty? [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7479.04s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7482.639999999999s)]
*  I mean, in this business, you get people who are incredibly desperate for fame [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7483.28s)]
*  and they're incredibly... [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7487.92s)]
*  In our business too. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7488.639999999999s)]
*  And they're willing to do... [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7489.68s)]
*  Like, I just had a buddy who said that they weren't going to do something [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7492.5599999999995s)]
*  or they were going to cancel something. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7496.32s)]
*  I'm going to try to be vague here. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7498.08s)]
*  And they were going to cancel something because doing it was getting them a lot of hate. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7499.76s)]
*  And that thing that they were going to do is with somebody who really, [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7504.24s)]
*  I mean, kind of put them on and give them opportunities, et cetera. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7508.719999999999s)]
*  But just because they were worried about their career and what was going on with them, [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7511.599999999999s)]
*  they're like, I got to cancel it. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7515.04s)]
*  So people are going to prioritize themselves first. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7516.639999999999s)]
*  But I hear the point you're making, which is like, oh shit, maybe our perception is [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7518.8s)]
*  that he's so benevolent, he's helping all these guys. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7522.08s)]
*  When maybe they don't really see it that way. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7524.32s)]
*  Is that what you guys are saying? [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7526.0s)]
*  Yeah, like zero people are coming. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7527.36s)]
*  There should be one person, I would think. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7529.36s)]
*  Now, granted, I think you were first to support Rogan and that helped open up. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7531.36s)]
*  I was supposed to actually do after his controversy happened, [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7534.4s)]
*  I was supposed to do the pod that Monday, which was crazy, [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7537.04s)]
*  but like never crossed my mind to not do it. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7540.08s)]
*  I was like, man, you got it. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7542.0s)]
*  This guy's helped out Schultz. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7543.84s)]
*  Schultz has helped out you. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7545.2s)]
*  He's offering you this platform. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7546.719999999999s)]
*  You do this fucking podcast. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7548.08s)]
*  There's no question about it. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7549.2s)]
*  There's no one doing that for Drake. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7550.16s)]
*  Zero people. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7552.08s)]
*  And again, I am biased and I don't know if he's a bad guy. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7552.88s)]
*  So maybe I shouldn't present this, but... [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7556.88s)]
*  All these guys are industry friends. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7559.52s)]
*  Like all that twin shit. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7560.8s)]
*  They're not really friends. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7563.4400000000005s)]
*  And so it's like... [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7564.320000000001s)]
*  Is there one human being, just one human being who's like, [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7564.88s)]
*  yeah, this is a good guy. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7567.6s)]
*  I'm going to vote for... [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7568.72s)]
*  Yeah, but it's not them voting as a good guy. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7569.4400000000005s)]
*  They would have to go against... [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7572.0s)]
*  Birdman is the only guy defending you? [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7573.76s)]
*  What's going on? [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7576.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but that's what I'm saying. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7576.8s)]
*  The industry is against all of these guys. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7578.0s)]
*  This is a great point. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7580.96s)]
*  Yeah, like pull like this. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7581.92s)]
*  If you're industry friends and the industry is against him, [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7582.88s)]
*  then you're going to side with the industry because you see your security, [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7586.64s)]
*  safety and longevity within the industry. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7589.6s)]
*  It just exposes that these friendships and my twin, my dog... [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7592.4800000000005s)]
*  Metro said it earlier. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7598.240000000001s)]
*  Everyone has the biggest side. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7599.4400000000005s)]
*  If you pick Drake's side, you almost have to hope that he survives it. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7600.72s)]
*  Obviously he'll survive, but he'll survive for Drake. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7607.280000000001s)]
*  Will Drake still have that ability to help you? [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7610.0s)]
*  Because now you're making an enemy of the weekend. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7612.56s)]
*  You're making an enemy of Metro Boomin. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7615.360000000001s)]
*  Future. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7617.68s)]
*  All of these guys who... [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7618.72s)]
*  There's much more that's not even present. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7620.96s)]
*  This whole faction. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7624.08s)]
*  This is why being able to have your own audience and create your own shit, [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7625.6s)]
*  not feeling so dependent is so important. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7631.84s)]
*  We can go to war for Joe. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7634.64s)]
*  We can go to war for Charlotte. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7637.52s)]
*  We can go to war for any of the people that we really care about, right? [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7638.72s)]
*  Because we're not dependent on the industry. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7642.64s)]
*  The second you are dependent, the second... [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7646.96s)]
*  Oh, fuck, man. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7648.56s)]
*  The only hit I ever had was with Metro. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7649.200000000001s)]
*  And if I say this, Metro not going to feed me any more beats. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7650.96s)]
*  And then what if I just bought a house and then my kids in private school and shit, [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7653.04s)]
*  I won't be able to pay. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7656.4800000000005s)]
*  All right, let me just be quiet. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7657.12s)]
*  Yeah, you're shackled by your ties to the industry. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7659.200000000001s)]
*  I'm still wondering though, what the fuck did he do to all these guys? [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7663.76s)]
*  That's what I'm trying to ask. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7667.04s)]
*  How don't you know this shit? [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7669.04s)]
*  I mean, like... [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7671.36s)]
*  Could you speculate? [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7672.32s)]
*  Just speculate. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7673.12s)]
*  Well, we've just heard bullshit reasons. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7673.92s)]
*  Like reasons that are just like very light. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7675.839999999999s)]
*  Fucking girls. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7678.16s)]
*  Like... [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7678.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, like things like that. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7679.36s)]
*  I mean, Rick Ross on his song, he said, yo, it's because you sent a cease and desist. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7681.04s)]
*  But like... [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7684.16s)]
*  That ain't it. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7684.639999999999s)]
*  Like the guy who you're mad at, like French is still following Drake. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7685.36s)]
*  There's a deeper issue and I see Metro allude to it. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7689.679999999999s)]
*  He said, stop acting like the reason we fell out is because of a girl. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7692.4s)]
*  You didn't fuck my girl. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7696.32s)]
*  I'll spare you. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7697.28s)]
*  He said, I'll spare us both. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7701.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7702.88s)]
*  He was going to look bad too. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7703.04s)]
*  To be fair to Drake. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7704.5599999999995s)]
*  Metro, whatever the reason was going to be, he said, the reason I'm not telling you is [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7705.92s)]
*  I'll make both of us look bad. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7708.5599999999995s)]
*  Did he say that? [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7710.8s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7711.36s)]
*  Yeah, he said that. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7711.84s)]
*  He said, I'll spare both of us. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7712.8s)]
*  But he says, you look much worse if I tell what it is, but I'll spare both of us. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7715.04s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7721.5199999999995s)]
*  So I read it as if like, oh, if I say what happened, [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7722.4s)]
*  it's I'm going to be embarrassed, but you're going to look like the bad guy. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7726.88s)]
*  But I think what we're all trying to say here is it would make Drake look way worse, [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7733.04s)]
*  which is why Drake won't come out with it. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7737.679999999999s)]
*  He still looks stupid. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7739.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7741.5199999999995s)]
*  Metro will still have some sort of negative feeling about it, but not as bad as potentially Drake. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7742.24s)]
*  So maybe this has happened time and time again, [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7747.92s)]
*  and enough people have been affected that nobody's coming out. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7750.16s)]
*  I didn't even ask Drake. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7752.799999999999s)]
*  I was like, yo. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7754.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean, that's your guy's business. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7756.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, I mean, and I don't think he's going to. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7758.400000000001s)]
*  This is probably again, the mere fact that we've gotten two albums, a bunch of diss songs, [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7761.84s)]
*  and none of these guys have said you did A, B, C, and D. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7766.400000000001s)]
*  That's odd. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7771.360000000001s)]
*  We're beefing and fighting, but we can't even address the reasons why. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7773.4400000000005s)]
*  What Drake has told me was like, yo, he honestly just feels it comes from like [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7777.84s)]
*  people viewing his position. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7781.44s)]
*  Like, you know, jealousy, envy. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7783.44s)]
*  Jealousy, the fact that he's at the top, he got the jet, the lifestyle, the, you know what I mean, [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7786.0s)]
*  the money, and because of whatever, you know, maybe wrong or slight, even sometimes if he doesn't [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7790.16s)]
*  intend it, they may have just like harbored feelings for him. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7796.719999999999s)]
*  But I still look at him like, nah, not this amount of niggas just come like, yo, it's time to get him today. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7800.879999999999s)]
*  There is some validity to jealousy. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7805.5199999999995s)]
*  We all get jealous. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7807.759999999999s)]
*  We all whatever. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7808.5599999999995s)]
*  But when a guy at the top writes off everything, is there just jealous? [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7809.92s)]
*  I don't fully believe that. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7814.48s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7815.5199999999995s)]
*  That's not on a page. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7816.48s)]
*  And especially it looks even weirder when you're the guy, like, you're the guy that took Jay-Z's [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7817.28s)]
*  model to Super Saiyan when you put your hand around the new guy. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7823.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7826.8s)]
*  Like, if every comic went against Joe Rogan and wouldn't say why, [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7827.12s)]
*  you would probably have to say, what the fuck did Joe do? [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7832.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the easy thing to say is, well, yeah, your job is a spot, but it's like, well, [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7836.320000000001s)]
*  it's kind of helped all y'all. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7840.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7842.0s)]
*  And that's this is a fucking great conspiracy right here. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7843.040000000001s)]
*  Yeah, no, I really don't know. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7846.160000000001s)]
*  Anybody who spent time with Joe will vouch for Joe. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7847.4400000000005s)]
*  He's a great fucking guy. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7849.76s)]
*  Blah, blah, blah. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7850.8s)]
*  That's not happened. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7852.080000000001s)]
*  None of these. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7852.8s)]
*  All right. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7853.84s)]
*  Has anybody vouched for Drake? [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7854.0s)]
*  Birdman. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7857.200000000001s)]
*  Bursal. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7858.0s)]
*  Yachty. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7858.400000000001s)]
*  I'm sure Yachty's been. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7858.8s)]
*  I don't even know if Yachty's come out. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7859.76s)]
*  Because Yachty had liked to post that seemingly was dissing the other guys. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7861.84s)]
*  He said, no, it was a mistake. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7865.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7866.48s)]
*  It's like, bro, it's your man's. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7866.8s)]
*  Like, you guys paint your nails together. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7868.4s)]
*  You got to stand on it. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7869.759999999999s)]
*  This time, like, yo, you get the little gel joints done together. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7871.12s)]
*  You got to stand on it right now. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7874.16s)]
*  They just did a podcast together on the beach with it. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7875.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7877.759999999999s)]
*  Who's Zach something? [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7879.28s)]
*  Kendrick said you're playing dirty with Zach. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7880.96s)]
*  It's like Zach Beard. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7882.88s)]
*  He's a bit into or he's accusing Drake because that's another angle that you're masterful. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7884.24s)]
*  He's defeated every possible angle Drake could go. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7892.16s)]
*  Number one. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7896.08s)]
*  All right. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7898.56s)]
*  There's the angle of, hey, the venue for this beef is Academic Stream and he's a number one Drake fan. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7899.360000000001s)]
*  How does this play out? [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7905.360000000001s)]
*  You know what he says? [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7907.2s)]
*  He's compromised. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7908.56s)]
*  He hits everything. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7909.6s)]
*  And so the Zach Beard thing is, at first, the internet lopsidedly was like, yo, it's Drake, [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7910.96s)]
*  Drake, Drake, Drake, Drake. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7919.04s)]
*  And Kendrick kind of negates it by kind of like trying to air out and put into air. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7920.48s)]
*  Drake is using a whole bunch of bots. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7925.04s)]
*  Zach Beard is a guy who's, I think he manages Yeat, but like, [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7927.12s)]
*  there are these nefarious individuals that kind of make narratives happen. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7932.879999999999s)]
*  So he's the bot man. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7936.799999999999s)]
*  Well, that's what he's alluding to. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7938.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7939.839999999999s)]
*  You're the bot man. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7940.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7940.879999999999s)]
*  Like, yo, you're cooking up the bots with Drake. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7941.679999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7944.08s)]
*  And him kind of like throwing certain things into the air. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7945.12s)]
*  You got to listen to these songs. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7948.4s)]
*  I know. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7949.76s)]
*  You're driving me crazy. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7950.08s)]
*  You didn't speak with some authority. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7951.52s)]
*  I sent him every song in order. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7953.4400000000005s)]
*  He did. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7955.12s)]
*  He did. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7955.4400000000005s)]
*  Now, to be fair, I've never spoken authority about the music. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7956.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7958.56s)]
*  I don't care. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7959.84s)]
*  You got to. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7962.320000000001s)]
*  Buddy, not like us is such a fucking banger. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7963.04s)]
*  I know. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7966.64s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7966.96s)]
*  Yo, I promise you. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7967.4400000000005s)]
*  It is the back to back of this battle. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7968.24s)]
*  Two minutes of song. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7969.360000000001s)]
*  Give it two. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7971.280000000001s)]
*  Give it two. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7971.76s)]
*  If Me the Grams was actually all factual, [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7972.4800000000005s)]
*  it's insane. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7977.12s)]
*  It would be probably one of the biggest knockout punches we've seen. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7977.76s)]
*  To not only reveal, and I wrote a verse to your mom explaining that this industry has [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7984.56s)]
*  corrupted her son and turned him into a pedophile. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7991.360000000001s)]
*  Let's say that's also real, which that's not real, obviously. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7994.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7996.88s)]
*  And then I showed how you've neglected actual real responsibility, [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=7997.4400000000005s)]
*  chased the worst things that comes along with fame, [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=8003.76s)]
*  the things that you think I'm jealous of you for. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=8006.88s)]
*  It's not just like parenting. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=8011.92s)]
*  It's just like you're hiding another child. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=8013.28s)]
*  He's dropping these lines like, you call yourself the boy, [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=8016.0s)]
*  I'm going to help you turn to the man. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=8019.6s)]
*  That's kind of like it's taking every... [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=8021.6s)]
*  You just can't listen to Drake just talk about, [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=8024.16s)]
*  I'm going to the club to fuck some bitches no more. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=8026.400000000001s)]
*  This guy's basically saying, this guy's a piece of shit and a creep. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=8028.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=8031.92s)]
*  Fuck a rap beef. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=8032.24s)]
*  It's a war with yourself. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=8033.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=8034.32s)]
*  Y'all want to listen to this guy? [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=8034.72s)]
*  For the turn up? [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=8036.88s)]
*  I should have listened to that. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=8037.599999999999s)]
*  When I heard that one, I was like... [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkSt_gw5-XI&t=8038.719999999999s)]
