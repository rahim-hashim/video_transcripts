*  Goat storyteller, one of the best comedians out there. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5.12s)]
*  You've seen him on Def Comedy Jam and his Domino Effect specials, four of them. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7.72s)]
*  This is unprecedented the amount of comedy he's actually put out for free for all of you on the internet. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11.72s)]

*  Aly turned his tough life into comedy gold. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=19.52s)]
*  He's raw, he's real, relentless, no gimmicks, just pure, hilarious storytelling. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=22.12s)]
*  I want to dive in because I feel like what you're experiencing was a lot of us have experienced when we put stuff on YouTube is like, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=27.08s)]
*  you're getting big views, you're selling out these huge venues. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=34.76s)]
*  But there's also this thing where it's like, is it just in our little bubble? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=39.4s)]
*  Have you felt that? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=43.44s)]
*  Yeah, I think I'm in a little bubble. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=44.4s)]
*  I don't think it's popped the ceiling yet. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=45.92s)]
*  But then you look at the views, if 100 million people have watched this, what ceiling? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=47.84s)]
*  I'm waiting on India. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=52.44s)]
*  I think with Alys and Deek you might get Pakistan first. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=53.76s)]
*  I think white people think I'm Indian. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=58.68s)]
*  No way. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=64.64s)]
*  I just recently did Boston. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=66.08s)]
*  Hold on, hold on. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=69.16s)]
*  When I was a kid, white people couldn't understand that I was, they thought I was black. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=70.16s)]
*  When they were racist toward me, it would be go back to Africa. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=77.24s)]
*  They would call me the N word. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=79.92s)]
*  And I would be like, I think I'm supposed to be offended. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=80.8s)]
*  What happened in Boston? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=83.16s)]
*  So this is when I was, I hate to put them out there, but because she rectified it, but [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=86.72s)]
*  it was, I was at Boston laughs. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  Right? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=93.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=94.84s)]
*  And two white guys opened for me and I walk out and this white dude was like, I thought [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=95.84s)]
*  he was Indian and he just turned his back to the stage. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=102.88s)]
*  I was like, what? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=106.84s)]
*  How much is this white guy love Indians? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=111.08s)]
*  I think he was more offended that I was black. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=113.52s)]
*  I would have never came if I knew he was black. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=120.72s)]
*  Indian yes, but black no. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=123.0s)]
*  I like how Buzz is like just getting a little less racist. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=125.0s)]
*  It's like they've accepted the color spectrum a little bit. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=128.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=131.68s)]
*  Really? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=132.68s)]
*  You thought they would get over it with Bill Russell bringing so many championships. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=133.68s)]
*  I just like hear racism a lot. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=137.92s)]
*  I've thought about this too. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=140.04s)]
*  It's like there might've been a period during Bill Russell's reign because it's not like [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  he didn't just win them as a player. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=145.92s)]
*  He won them as a coach. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=148.0s)]
*  Like I'm wondering what is happening to like the racist people in Boston at that time when [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=149.92s)]
*  he wins what nine as a player and then they're going to bestow like the most important position [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=154.28s)]
*  for the franchise that they care about. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=159.92s)]
*  The coach. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=162.84s)]
*  This is my thing against racist black men who argue about Jordan. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=164.72s)]
*  Because I think you just this is my problem with it with the whole Bill Russell thing. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=169.8s)]
*  So somebody said who's one of the greatest coaches of all time? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=175.36s)]
*  They're going to mention Red All-Pocket. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=178.24s)]
*  They're not going to say, oh, it was the era. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=179.72s)]
*  He didn't know. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  No, they're just going to mention him. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=183.48000000000002s)]
*  But when it gets to Bill Russell, oh, he didn't play against nobody. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=186.88s)]
*  He played against everybody in his era. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  He played against Wilton and everybody else. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=192.24s)]
*  But then when he left, when Red All-Pocket left, he became the coach and he played and [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=195.52s)]
*  coached Jordan. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=202.04000000000002s)]
*  There's no way Jordan could have played and coached. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=203.04000000000002s)]
*  There's no way. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  And played 36 holes of golf. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=207.56s)]
*  Impossible. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=208.88s)]
*  He had to cut 10 players on the team. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=209.88s)]
*  It's just me and Scotty. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=213.68s)]
*  Everybody else sit down. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=216.08s)]
*  It's amazing how they just try to diminish what he did in basketball. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=221.0s)]
*  He has 11 champions. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=225.48s)]
*  I wonder if part of it is like that was a time I think in the NBA, my dad would tell [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=226.96s)]
*  me his story. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=232.68s)]
*  So Bill Russell, my dad saw he was the first person he ever saw dunk a basketball. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=233.68s)]
*  It was like during a layup lines and he was like, I just saw him jump up there dunk. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=237.6s)]
*  He goes to me, Bill Russell is the best player that he ever saw play because he completely [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=241.72s)]
*  changed the game even defensively. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=245.58s)]
*  This was a time where my dad would tell me that like when the Knicks were playing at [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=248.84s)]
*  the same time, the what is it with clowns and stuff? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=252.36s)]
*  What is that called? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=256.2s)]
*  The circus. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=257.2s)]
*  The circus. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=258.2s)]
*  When the circus was in town. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=259.2s)]
*  What did they call it? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=260.2s)]
*  The carnival. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=261.2s)]
*  I forgot the name of that shit. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=262.2s)]
*  I'm about to call it the barbershop. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=263.2s)]
*  He told me the Knicks would be bumped out of the garden for the circus. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=264.2s)]
*  The finals are on tape delay apparently. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=277.64s)]
*  Ringling Brothers was huge. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=283.47999999999996s)]
*  Come on bro. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=284.47999999999996s)]
*  We might need to see the circus. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=285.47999999999996s)]
*  Hey, we're having a circus here. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=286.47999999999996s)]
*  Can you tame an elephant? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=287.47999999999996s)]
*  No. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=288.47999999999996s)]
*  We'll get it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=289.47999999999996s)]
*  Anyway, that was kind of wild times. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=290.47999999999996s)]
*  Bill Russell is the dude that has a picture where he's just wearing all the rings. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=291.47999999999996s)]
*  More rings and fingers. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=298.47999999999996s)]
*  Player and coach. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=299.47999999999996s)]
*  At a time where they weren't even in the game. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=300.47999999999996s)]
*  I think in certain cities, stay in the same hotel as the white players. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=302.48s)]
*  And he did all this in chucks. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=314.6s)]
*  That's why they had to dribble like this. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=317.6s)]
*  You know the craziest Bill Russell stat? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=324.72s)]
*  If I think it's 14-0 in game sevens. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=331.48s)]
*  He never lost a game seven. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=334.0s)]
*  Game seven, Bill Russell, you win. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=335.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=338.0s)]
*  There's nobody else I can think of that ever had that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=339.0s)]
*  Were you a big hoop fan growing up? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=342.32000000000005s)]
*  Always. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=344.0s)]
*  Basketball. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=345.0s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=346.0s)]
*  But was it obviously Rockets? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=347.0s)]
*  Obviously Rome. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=348.0s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=349.0s)]

*  Remember we were all Braves fans for no reason? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=367.4s)]
*  It was just because they were on TV. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=368.4s)]
*  He was a circus fan when he was growing up. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=369.4s)]
*  I know that shit. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=370.4s)]

*  Okay. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=426.4s)]
*  So what is, I think we have to accept that LT at his prime, I think. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=427.4s)]
*  And high cocaine, for sure. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=431.4s)]
*  Why do we diminish the value of cocaine in the excitement of the sport? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=436.4s)]
*  Because remember in like the 80s when the basketball players were just fist fighting on the court? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=442.4s)]
*  Yeah, I thought all of them was high. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=446.4s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=451.4s)]

*  Olajuwon, it's like nobody wanted to fight the dream. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=457.4s)]
*  You heard the Vernon and Maxwell story? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=460.4s)]
*  You heard Vernon talk about it? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=463.4s)]
*  I know Max. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=464.4s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=465.4s)]
*  And me and Max used to be in the club back in the day. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=466.4s)]
*  But when he said about Olajuwon slapping him, I was like, yeah. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=469.4s)]
*  The dream was like, hey man, stop all that fat mouthing, bro. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=473.4s)]
*  In his broken Nigerian language, bro. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=480.4s)]
*  I've been at the mosque with him. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=484.4s)]
*  At the where? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=489.4s)]
*  At the mosque. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=490.4s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=491.4s)]
*  So his brothers are bigger than him. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=492.4s)]
*  It's crazy how big his brothers are. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=495.4s)]
*  But to be next to him in prayer. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=498.4s)]
*  It's a big orphan. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=502.4s)]
*  Yo man, I'm going to go to the back. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=506.4s)]
*  This thing, this thing, like I can't even concentrate. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=509.4s)]
*  Imagine being right behind those feet. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=514.4s)]
*  Oh man, like you're praying in the back. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=517.4s)]
*  It's crazy how big he is. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=521.4s)]
*  So were you in Houston going to the mosque while he was playing for the team? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=524.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=529.4s)]
*  Really? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=530.4s)]
*  So he was just going to like. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=531.4s)]
*  He had drafted in 84. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=532.4s)]
*  I was not there. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=533.4s)]
*  I was locked up in 80. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=535.4s)]
*  That's the thing about I always go back to like I missed and I hated too. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=537.4s)]
*  Like people would be talking to me about years. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=542.4s)]
*  Oh, you're locked up to Houston's rings? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=544.4s)]
*  And let me tell you, the terrible thing about this, they play in the Knicks. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=547.4s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=552.4s)]
*  Painful memory for all of you. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=554.4s)]
*  I'm the only one in a Texas prison rooting for the Knicks. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=556.4s)]
*  Oh, you just want your life to be hard. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=560.4s)]
*  So when the Knicks lose, it's like everybody in the cafeteria was waiting. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=565.4s)]
*  They weren't even eating. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=570.4s)]
*  They were just. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=571.4s)]
*  As soon as I came in, I was playing shit. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=573.4s)]
*  And then I remember San Antonio was playing the Knicks. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=578.4s)]
*  I had on a Knick jersey. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=581.4s)]
*  I'm performing at this club downtown and I'm with Rodney Winfield. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=582.4s)]
*  He's a legend. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=586.4s)]
*  And this is how he talked. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=589.4s)]
*  Rodney was like, God damn, why don't you just take off the goddamn jersey? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=590.4s)]
*  Because I'm walking downtown and everybody fucking with me because the Knicks lost to San Antonio. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=594.4s)]
*  He said, man, just take off the jersey, bro, because I can't fight with you. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=598.4s)]
*  I'm over. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=602.4s)]
*  He's looking out for himself. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=604.4s)]
*  He's not even worried about you. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=606.4s)]
*  Yo, OK, I've seen like so many videos. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=608.4s)]
*  You can obviously tell these great stories. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=610.4s)]
*  I think there's like a little part of me like as a comedian, like if ever, God forbid, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=612.4s)]
*  I got locked up and like, oh, what if I could use my my comedy abilities to lighten the mood in the jail or whatever? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=618.4s)]
*  And I'm watching. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=623.4s)]
*  I know it's so stupid, right? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=625.4s)]
*  But I'm very curious because a lot of your stories you're talking about kind of teasing people. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=626.4s)]
*  At what point do you build up the courage to be like roasting guys who are locked up probably for some dangerous shit? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=632.4s)]
*  Is there ever a point where you're like, man, that's not the guy I'm going to tease? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=641.4s)]
*  Like, how do you build rapport to be yourself? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=646.4s)]
*  Um, I knew company. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=648.4s)]
*  You know, I was there for like six or the first two hours making my bones. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=652.4s)]
*  OK, so people understood he's going to say whatever he's going to say, regardless. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=656.4s)]
*  Fighting him is not the way to go because you you grew up boxing. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=661.4s)]
*  Right. OK, so you can. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=666.4s)]
*  And I know mass majority of people can't fight. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=668.4s)]
*  I like I know it. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=671.4s)]
*  So I'm like this. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=672.4s)]
*  I'm like, like, you really want to do this? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=674.4s)]
*  So you weren't scared at all? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=676.4s)]
*  I've never been scared. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=677.4s)]
*  Not even in the beginning. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=678.4s)]
*  You tell this great story is one of the first thing I saw on our show about the Mexicans are wearing boots. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=680.4s)]
*  Yeah, I was I was unaware, but not scared. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=686.4s)]
*  I wanted to know what it means. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=689.4s)]
*  Have you? Have you guys? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=691.4s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=692.4s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=693.4s)]
*  Yeah, I just was unaware. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=694.4s)]
*  So in Domino Fake 3, that's why it's damn near my favorite one because it's showing how unaware I was. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=696.4s)]
*  When I got locked up in the county, I'm like, I'm so unaware how this the process. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=701.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=706.4s)]
*  But when dudes at the balls like, you know, you slapped my sister. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=707.4s)]
*  I'm like, no, I've never slapped a woman. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=712.4s)]
*  Don't even know your sister. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=714.4s)]
*  And then once I figured out they was talking to me, I was like, oh, shit. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=716.4s)]
*  So you're trying to start something with me. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=720.4s)]
*  Oh, they're making up a big thing. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=723.4s)]
*  They make up a thing. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=725.4s)]
*  And I couldn't and once I figured out they was talking to me, I couldn't wait for them to come and let me in the cell. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=726.4s)]

*  And I'm sitting there waiting with this sandwich that I'm not going to eat. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=762.4s)]
*  Just because you think you don't never eat because you think you're going to get out. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=767.4s)]
*  Yeah. You know, I'm straight. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=770.4s)]
*  He didn't know how much his bond was. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=772.4s)]

*  Say you're not a drug dealer. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=799.4s)]
*  I got to go to court and try to act like I need bond reduction. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=800.4s)]
*  I'm going to put my resort in Cabo up. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=804.4s)]
*  That's collateral. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=807.4s)]
*  And so I'm waiting and the dude was like, you know, that's him. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=810.4s)]
*  And I'm looking down the hallway like, oh, no, they're not talking about me. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=815.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's who slapped my sister. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=820.4s)]
*  And I was like, who is this abusive guy? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=823.4s)]
*  Who should fuck him up? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=826.4s)]
*  Who they're talking to? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=831.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I'm going to stop. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=832.4s)]
*  I'm going to whoop your ass when you come in there. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=834.4s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, am I the only one in this hallway? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=836.4s)]
*  Oh, so they talking to me. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=840.4s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=842.4s)]
*  So my first thing is like, yo, as soon as I get in there, we're going to see. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=843.4s)]
*  Because I do not like to be lied to. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=848.4s)]
*  Then you have a friend who was like jacked and tall. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=850.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's Brian. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=853.4s)]
*  Brian became my friend too. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=854.4s)]
*  It's Poo Poo and Brian. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=856.4s)]
*  And this is this is the shit that they do to bother people when they get ready to come in. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=857.4s)]
*  So as soon as I get in, I put my stuff down and I'm like, yo, what's up? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=864.4s)]
*  And dude's like, what? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=870.4s)]
*  I said, you said I slapped your sister. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=872.4s)]
*  I'm fucking with you. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=874.4s)]
*  I'm like, yo, but I'm still want to fight because you you made up this narrative about me. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=876.4s)]
*  And I just want I just want to get it on. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=882.4s)]
*  I don't have it. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=885.4s)]
*  But I used to hear about this tank when I was in the street. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=886.4s)]
*  10B3 is 1301 Franklin Street. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=889.4s)]
*  This is a notorious place. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=892.4s)]
*  OK. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=894.4s)]
*  And you would hear about it. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=895.4s)]
*  They'd be squabbling in 10B3. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=896.4s)]
*  You would hear about it. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=898.4s)]
*  And people say you don't want to go to a corner tank. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=899.4s)]
*  And so when they're assigning people tanks and I'm just sitting there, I'm standing there, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=902.4s)]
*  they give it all these people these other floors. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=906.4s)]
*  He get right to me and say 10B3. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=908.4s)]
*  I'm like, ain't that some bullshit? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=911.4s)]
*  So that's my that was my whole thing. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=915.4s)]
*  I still wanted to fight. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=917.4s)]
*  And did you guys end up? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=918.4s)]
*  No, because they was just bothering me. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=920.4s)]
*  So then maybe I'm in this tank for about what? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=922.4s)]
*  Fight my case about five, six months. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=925.4s)]
*  Now I'm doing the same shit. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=927.4s)]
*  Tell other people. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=929.4s)]
*  That's him. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=930.4s)]
*  OK, so you get convicted because you end up going to prison. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=937.4s)]
*  OK. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=941.4s)]
*  Upon conviction, you say you've never been afraid, but you have to be like processing outcomes. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=942.4s)]
*  Right. Like, are you worried about, oh, I'm going to bump into this person who has beef with a friend of mine on the outside? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=947.4s)]
*  Like, I don't really have a lot of beef. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=953.4s)]
*  So now my crew was protected, but my whole crew was locked up. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=955.4s)]
*  They got all of us at one time. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=959.4s)]
*  So it was a homecoming. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=960.4s)]
*  So it was like, yo, all of y'all come on this way. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=961.4s)]
*  So I really wasn't concerned about that. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=964.4s)]
*  Was it really the last drug deal you were like legitimately? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=967.4s)]
*  That was legitimate. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=970.4s)]
*  I was done. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=971.4s)]
*  And you got pulled into one last. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=972.4s)]
*  It was like a moment. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=974.4s)]
*  And I wasn't even supposed to be in this shit. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=975.4s)]
*  Like, I was literally out. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=977.4s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=979.4s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=980.4s)]
*  You were out. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=981.4s)]
*  You decided you're doing something else. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=982.4s)]
*  I'm done. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=984.4s)]
*  I'm done. I'm out. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=985.4s)]
*  I'm done. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=986.4s)]
*  Do one more with me. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=987.4s)]
*  And he's like, yo, man, just do this last round and watch my back. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=988.4s)]
*  And I'm like, OK. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=990.4s)]
*  And then I'm there. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=992.4s)]
*  And I kept saying it. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=994.4s)]
*  Saying it like we never would have been locked up if they if Mo would have listened to me [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=996.4s)]
*  and wasn't on his. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1001.4s)]
*  See, when people have financial woes, they make bad decisions. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1003.4s)]
*  Yeah, desperation. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1006.4s)]
*  You know, you get attitude with your friends. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1007.4s)]
*  You got all this shit. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1009.4s)]
*  So I get there and we in this hotel room and they won't let me go to the bathroom. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1010.4s)]
*  They say they taught something wrong. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1017.4s)]
*  They told it. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1018.4s)]
*  OK. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1019.4s)]
*  And this is just me processing all of it. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1021.4s)]
*  So when we sit down and they bring out the money, the first thing I asked, well, like, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1024.4s)]
*  wow, hundreds and fifties. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1031.4s)]
*  This is a drug deal. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1033.4s)]
*  Hundreds and fifty. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1035.4s)]
*  I'm like, oh, that's weird. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1036.4s)]
*  Why? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1037.4s)]
*  Because lower amounts would indicate when you sell drugs, it's going to be a lot of tens [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1038.4s)]
*  and fives and twenties and sliced up. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1045.4s)]
*  That's what you're getting paid in. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1048.4s)]
*  If you got clean bills, it's probably coming from the sting operating. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1049.4s)]
*  And it's clean bills. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1053.4s)]
*  And I asked, I said, hey, what's these numbers on the money? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1055.4s)]
*  And they said, oh, man, we just that's a bank numbers came from the Franklin Bank in New Orleans. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1059.4s)]
*  I just left New Orleans and I'm like, Franklin Bank, Franklin, Franklin. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1065.4s)]
*  I said, OK, so I thumbed through the money and then I did the sign. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1071.4s)]
*  I knocked on the table three times, which in this was a tell Mo. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1076.4s)]
*  This is the police. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1081.4s)]
*  We've done this. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1082.4s)]
*  Let's deal. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1083.4s)]
*  We go outside and I say, Mo, tell Charles, don't come to the parking lot with the coke. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1085.4s)]
*  This is this is bad. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1092.4s)]
*  He goes down and tell Charles once I find out once we get locked up and we had to go to court together. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1094.4s)]
*  Charles told me what he said. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1100.4s)]
*  He said, oh, man, he made your boy nervous and he made it sound good. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1102.4s)]
*  And I'm asking Charles as a grown man, why would you think I was nervous? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1107.4s)]
*  He didn't run me since I was 14. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1112.4s)]
*  When was I? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1115.4s)]
*  When was I ever nervous? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1116.4s)]

*  How you and Charles became friends is the funniest story. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1252.4s)]
*  This might be my favorite story in the whole special. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1255.4s)]
*  Tell it, tell it, tell it. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1258.4s)]
*  So, Charles is running the apartments. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1259.4s)]
*  And what does that mean? [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1262.4s)]
*  Like, he's the supplier for most everybody in the apartments. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1264.4s)]
*  Got it. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1268.4s)]
*  They're selling this stuff. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1269.4s)]
*  And we, where we live at is maybe one, two, three, like six sets of apartments. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1270.4s)]
*  OK. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1275.4s)]
*  Everybody got their own little section. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1276.4s)]
*  But the Greens is where nobody goes. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1277.4s)]
*  They swear the police is over there. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1281.4s)]
*  So, I'm buying my dope from Ronel. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1283.4s)]
*  OK. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1287.4s)]
*  Which is Charles' brother-in-law. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1288.4s)]
*  And they in the crew. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1291.4s)]
*  You don't generally meet Charles. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1293.4s)]
*  Yeah, you don't really meet Charles. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1295.4s)]
*  You just meet Ronel. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1296.4s)]
*  You probably don't want to. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1297.4s)]
*  So, I'm buying my little stuff from Ronel. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1298.4s)]
*  And I decided to go to the Greens. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1301.4s)]
*  And how I go to the Greens is because it's a homosexual guy named Tink that tells Ronel, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1304.4s)]
*  it was very sassy. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1317.4s)]
*  He was selling Ronel, he was buying stuff from Ronel. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1319.4s)]
*  And he was like, Ronel, why I gotta buy my cracks over my... [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1322.4s)]
*  This outfit is, Tink must have been like a fan of Simmons, Richard Simmons. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1326.4s)]
*  He had on these little bitty ass Carl Lewis shorts, right? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1343.4s)]
*  And these leg warmers. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1347.4s)]
*  And he had this hat, and he had a curl that really didn't take. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1349.4s)]
*  So, it was just wet hair. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1352.4s)]
*  He had on a half-shirt that said, Thriller. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1354.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1357.4s)]
*  He's terrible. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1360.4s)]
*  But when he bought, I run around and catch him in the parking lot. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1363.4s)]
*  And I was like, hey, Tink, is people over there tonight? [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1369.4s)]
*  Yeah, we over there. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1372.4s)]
*  All you gotta do is come over there. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1373.4s)]
*  I bring everybody. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1375.4s)]
*  So, when I get to the pool, I get to the pool area. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1377.4s)]
*  He told me to wait at the pool. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1379.4s)]
*  And it's like, yo, he wasn't lying. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1381.4s)]
*  It was so many fiends over there. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1383.4s)]
*  They start coming out like Thriller, like Michael Jackson. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1386.4s)]
*  So, I'm over there, son. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1391.4s)]
*  So, now you're making money. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1394.4s)]
*  So, you're servicing this area that nobody went to because they thought the cops were over there. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1396.4s)]
*  But it was really just gay people. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1399.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1400.4s)]
*  Tink is the only one that's gay. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1402.4s)]
*  One takes one. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1405.4s)]
*  Everybody else is just regular people. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1407.4s)]
*  Tink is the only one over there with this bullshit. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1408.4s)]
*  You've seen Thriller. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1410.4s)]
*  You buy him one. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1411.4s)]
*  You all get it. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1412.4s)]
*  So, and Ronel notices that I'm buying more from him very rapidly. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1413.4s)]
*  So, Charles wanted to meet me. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1420.4s)]
*  And everybody hang out at the park. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1423.4s)]
*  I don't know why drug dealers take over a park. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1424.4s)]
*  They like the greenery. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1427.4s)]
*  It's not even a green park. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1429.4s)]
*  This is a park in apartments where they put down some rug. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1432.4s)]
*  They put a structure on top of it. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1438.4s)]
*  This is great. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1441.4s)]
*  They're doing their best. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1443.4s)]
*  You can look and see the pool. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1444.4s)]
*  So, I'm over there and Charles wanted to meet me. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1446.4s)]
*  And I came over there to buy something for Ronel. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1450.4s)]
*  And Charles keeps trying to talk to me. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1454.4s)]
*  And I'm like, no, I don't want to talk to him. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1456.4s)]
*  Wait, why? [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1458.4s)]
*  Because this is like Nino Brown. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1459.4s)]
*  Oh, that's the top guy. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1461.4s)]
*  I don't, hey man, what's up, little man? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1462.4s)]
*  I'm like, hey, can I just get my stuff so I can go? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1465.4s)]
*  And then Charles like, hey man, he told me that I was going to work for him. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1468.4s)]
*  Because I was selling so much. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1473.4s)]
*  He said, hey man, you're going to work for me. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1475.4s)]
*  And I'm like, no, I'm pretty cool. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1477.4s)]
*  You said no to it. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1479.4s)]
*  And then Charles, at the time I didn't know what this gun was. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1480.4s)]
*  You know, I found out later. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1483.4s)]
*  But this was the biggest gun I had ever seen, which was a Desert Eagle. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1485.4s)]
*  It comes from the United States. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1490.4s)]
*  And he pulls his gun out. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1491.4s)]
*  And he pulls his gun out. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1493.4s)]
*  He's like, hey man, what I say you going to do, you going to work for me. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1494.4s)]
*  And I had a 25 automatic that I had two weeks prior gotten to with this dude and took his gun. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1498.4s)]
*  His gun fell out. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1508.4s)]
*  And I grabbed it. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1509.4s)]
*  Not a crack head. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1510.4s)]
*  It fell out. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1511.4s)]
*  And I kept it. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1512.4s)]
*  It's like a video camera. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1513.4s)]
*  So when he pulled out his gun, I pulled mine out. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1515.4s)]
*  I'm like, no, I'm not going to work for you. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1520.4s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1522.4s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1523.4s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1524.4s)]
*  A guy points a Desert Eagle at you. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1525.4s)]
*  And then in that time, you take out your gun and point it back at him. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1526.4s)]
*  Is there any concern that normal people without you have for some reason have like no fear. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1531.4s)]
*  You have high fear tolerance. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1537.4s)]
*  But normal people would be like, if I pull out my gun, this person is just going to shoot me and then I'll die. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1538.4s)]
*  Why were you not worried that that was going to happen? [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1543.4s)]
*  Because he got to shoot. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1545.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1547.4s)]
*  You got to shoot. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1548.4s)]
*  You can't pull something on me. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1549.4s)]
*  You got to shoot. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1550.4s)]
*  Like if you pull the gun out and don't shoot, some people say like they're not willing to shoot in the first place. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1551.4s)]
*  I've been. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1556.4s)]
*  I have had a gun put on me three times and I've never been shot by either person. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1557.4s)]
*  This is actually the worst thing to happen because now you're probably too confident. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1563.4s)]
*  You said either person, which lets me know someone pulled it on you twice. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1566.4s)]
*  No. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1569.4s)]
*  Three different people. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1570.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1572.4s)]
*  And if my boy, Kid Styles, he was like, yep, this is what happened. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1573.4s)]
*  A dude put a gun on me because I was ribbing on him in the parking lot. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1577.4s)]
*  This is what I'm getting at. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1581.4s)]
*  You're going to be the first to shoot. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1583.4s)]
*  He gets mad because I'm talking about him in the parking lot and he pulls his gun on me and I looked towards Kid. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1585.4s)]
*  I said, Kid, he about to get his ass whooped. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1592.4s)]
*  And I turned and I said, hey, you better put that gun up before I fuck around and get mad out here. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1596.4s)]
*  And then I just turned back, talking to Kid and he put his gun. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1602.4s)]
*  And Kid was like, yo, you are a crazy man. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1605.4s)]
*  I said, man, if he was going to shoot, he would have shot. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1611.4s)]
*  Because if I pull out on you, I'm going to shoot your ass. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1615.4s)]
*  I'm for 100% going to shoot you. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1619.4s)]
*  It's not even a doubt in my mind that I'm going to shoot you. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1623.4s)]
*  I'm going to blow your fucking brains out. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1627.4s)]
*  Because in my mind, I can't pull a gun on you and not shoot you. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1629.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1633.4s)]
*  That's me. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1634.4s)]
*  But what happened in this situation where he pulled the gun out? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1635.4s)]
*  We're in the middle of Jamaica, Jamaica. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1637.4s)]
*  It's a club. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1639.4s)]
*  All these people out here, you're not fucking going to shoot me. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1640.4s)]
*  Got it. Got it. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1643.4s)]
*  So you were basically, you were telling Charles, you were basically like, listen. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1644.4s)]
*  Oh, with Charles, that was another person. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1647.4s)]
*  But going back to Charles, when he pulled, when I pulled my gun out, Charles is a big dude. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1649.4s)]
*  He's not a small dude. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1655.4s)]
*  Charles snatched my gun out of my hand. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1657.4s)]
*  This motherfucker got hot. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1661.4s)]
*  And I'm still sitting there with my hand like this. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1664.4s)]
*  You just got your gun finger up for no gun. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1666.4s)]
*  And the way he says it in specials first, he's like, this motherfucker, this landward put a gun on me. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1670.4s)]
*  Like he's laughing about it, then snatches it. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1674.4s)]
*  This shit is like, it is mine. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1676.4s)]
*  I just got hot and I didn't pull the gun on him. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1680.4s)]
*  He don't give a shit. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1682.4s)]
*  So he respected it. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1683.4s)]
*  Yeah. And then gave him my gun back and told me, man, nobody fuck with you, man. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1684.4s)]
*  You let me know. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1688.4s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1689.4s)]
*  So do you think a guy like him is so feared that he's actually looking for people with heart? [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1690.4s)]
*  He's looking for people with heart. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1694.4s)]
*  And especially you're like 16 at the time, right? [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1695.4s)]
*  14 I think. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1697.4s)]
*  Oh, 14. Yes. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1698.4s)]
*  The young ones, you want to get them early. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1699.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1701.4s)]
*  And if you see a young guy with heart, you're like, I can, I can school this guy up and he's going to be with you or against you. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1702.4s)]
*  I can teach him whatever he needs to know, too. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1708.4s)]
*  Like I can teach him all that. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1710.4s)]
*  Now, were you calculating that in the moment? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1711.4s)]
*  Were you like, I have to show him that I'm not scared? [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1713.4s)]
*  It was just a knee jerk. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1716.4s)]
*  It was just a reaction of you pulled a gun on me and OK, I got a gun, too. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1717.4s)]
*  And your shit got a flash, though, because if this shit get crazy, I'm going to shoot you. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1725.4s)]
*  Now, I may not hit you because it's a 25, which is the most inaccurate of a gun of all time. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1731.4s)]
*  But it's the fact. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1737.4s)]
*  Well, I've already acclimated myself to what's going on out here. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1740.4s)]
*  At first, I was very naive to it, but I've been through some some some little instances out here, so I got to get my shit together. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1744.4s)]
*  Even at 14 years old. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1752.4s)]
*  Drug dealing is not an easy thing. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1754.4s)]
*  If I would go back to 14 in this whole situation, I would just hoop. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1756.4s)]
*  I would just do so. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1761.4s)]
*  Give me a heart. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1765.4s)]
*  My mom or something else. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1768.4s)]
*  But and I and the crazy thing is I never had to be out there. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1770.4s)]
*  Yeah, I was like both your parents and your mom successful. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1774.4s)]
*  Your dad, your dad. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1777.4s)]
*  Was it like a career service? [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1778.4s)]
*  Carrier service. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1780.4s)]
*  Yeah, carrier service. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1781.4s)]
*  He was my dad never sold crack. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1782.4s)]
*  He only sold powder. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1783.4s)]
*  That's who he was doing all this. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1785.4s)]
*  This carrier stuff over these attorneys and they could you give me some powder? [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1787.4s)]
*  And then he started selling powder because he's selling it to the attorneys. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1790.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1795.4s)]
*  So he's doing the money drops in the exchanges for the attorneys because this is a time where I guess I guess what you're not going to be like sending bank transfers or whatever like that. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1796.4s)]
*  This is an in person. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1806.4s)]
*  He started that company in 1980. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1807.4s)]
*  So you have these successful, obviously smart parents. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1809.4s)]
*  You don't have to deal drugs at all. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1812.4s)]
*  You're in the environment, but then your mom moves away at a certain point in time. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1815.4s)]
*  She moves to a nicer area. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1819.4s)]
*  So like there is a version. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1820.4s)]
*  You're clearly a smart guy. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1822.4s)]
*  Is there ever a version when you're like around this world where you're like, what am I doing? [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1823.4s)]
*  Like I don't have to do this. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1828.4s)]
*  This is why I was getting out. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1829.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1830.4s)]
*  OK. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1831.4s)]
*  OK. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1832.4s)]
*  This is for the birds. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1833.4s)]
*  And what am I doing? [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1835.4s)]

*  It's a terrible present. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1879.4s)]
*  Here's a question I have when I'm watching though. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1881.4s)]
*  You got 230 cash afterward. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1883.4s)]
*  You're like, I'm out. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1885.4s)]
*  That's not quite enough that you could just invest it and be like set for life. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1886.4s)]
*  Where you got there from? [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1890.4s)]
*  No, dude. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1891.4s)]
*  At the time, like we're talking about 80s. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1892.4s)]
*  That's probably the rest of your life with 230 cash. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1894.4s)]
*  No, you start a business. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1896.4s)]
*  You can. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1897.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's why I'm so what is your plan beyond this? [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1898.4s)]
*  You have a plan like I'm going to do all type of shit going on. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1901.4s)]
*  Like I wasn't just making money from the window. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1905.4s)]
*  I had a condo my mama didn't know about. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1908.4s)]
*  I could have released it out. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1911.4s)]
*  I had all type of shit going on. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1913.4s)]
*  I had invested in this rap group. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1915.4s)]
*  I had a lot of shit going on. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1917.4s)]
*  So that's what I was wondering because I know you stopped at like 16. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1919.4s)]
*  You got to think of 230 in the 90s, the early 90s. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1922.4s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1927.4s)]

*  Texas too. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1931.4s)]
*  19, that's a lot. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1932.4s)]
*  Oh, it's a lot. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1933.4s)]
*  I'm curious if he doesn't get locked up. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1934.4s)]
*  Is there a point when he's like 25 or 23 or he's like, man, I was making so much money [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1936.4s)]
*  before I could go right back to that? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1941.4s)]
*  Because that is kind of what happened at 16. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1943.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1945.4s)]
*  We were dating that girl. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1946.4s)]
*  Everything is good. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1947.4s)]
*  And the money gets low. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1948.4s)]
*  I was chilling. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1949.4s)]

*  And I'm and I'm a kid. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1957.4s)]
*  I'm super kid at this point. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1960.4s)]
*  I'm just in high school. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1961.4s)]

*  And I'm moving around and I'm good. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1969.4s)]
*  I got 230 cash. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1971.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1973.4s)]
*  You know how many investments I could have started anything at that point. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1974.4s)]
*  Did you have to manage street politics at that age? [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1979.4s)]
*  Like, did you maintain business relationships with other like rivals? [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1982.4s)]

*  So it's not a lot of people who know me. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1990.4s)]
*  I'm not Charles is the main front face. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1993.4s)]
*  But I think that sometimes people get the errors mixed up. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=1996.4s)]
*  OK. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2000.4s)]
*  See, the early nice is early night, late 80s, early 90s. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2001.4s)]
*  It's not like whatever this shit is now or in the two thousand middle 2000s. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2005.4s)]
*  I don't have to know anybody because you nobody's coming from their side of town to my side of town. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2011.4s)]

*  That's not my now. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2021.4s)]
*  It's so interconnected. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2022.4s)]
*  But before it was neighborhood by neighborhood. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2024.4s)]
*  It was like people was trying to take over. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2026.4s)]
*  You try to take over a city now. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2028.4s)]

*  And you just go on them. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2054.4s)]
*  And this is when you show your car off. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2055.4s)]

*  You're outside. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2179.4s)]
*  I relate to that because it's like, I don't have a similar story, but not, nowhere to the level where you were at. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2180.4s)]
*  But just doing knucklehead shit. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2184.4s)]
*  And I didn't need to do it at all. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2185.4s)]
*  Like, I was good at home. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2187.4s)]
*  My mom had no idea of the stuff I was doing. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2189.4s)]
*  That's why one of the funniest stories is when you actually get locked up and you have to call your mom and tell her. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2191.4s)]
*  Didn't want to call her at all. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2195.4s)]
*  My mom had no idea I was doing any of the shit that I was doing. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2197.4s)]
*  It's so great. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2200.4s)]
*  That's the worst thing when you got a call and reveal your fucked up life to your mom. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2201.4s)]
*  And I was there for really two weeks before I called my mom. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2207.4s)]
*  Sweet. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2211.4s)]
*  You didn't go home for two weeks. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2212.4s)]
*  Your mom's probably weird. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2213.4s)]
*  I didn't live with my mom. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2214.4s)]
*  OK, got it. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2215.4s)]
*  So she's used to you not at least. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2216.4s)]
*  She used to me not. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2217.4s)]
*  Were you still calling her like, hey, what's up? [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2218.4s)]
*  Just checking in? [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2220.4s)]
*  No. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2221.4s)]
*  I can't call from the jail. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2222.4s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2223.4s)]
*  Can't tell you where it's from. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2224.4s)]
*  I'm hoping. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2225.4s)]
*  The way you did that first call, didn't you do a three way? [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2226.4s)]
*  So it did. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2228.4s)]
*  I'm talking about a buffer. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2229.4s)]
*  I'm talking about a buffer, man. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2230.4s)]
*  Because he's like, yo, this is terrible, man. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2231.4s)]
*  OK, so what happens when you tell it? [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2236.4s)]
*  Oh, my mom is pissed. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2238.4s)]
*  She is like, yo. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2241.4s)]
*  How do you break it to her? [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2245.4s)]
*  What do you say? [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2246.4s)]
*  What is the first thing you say? [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2247.4s)]
*  You told me I needed to be out when I was 18. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2248.4s)]
*  I said, man, they say I was selling drugs. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2250.4s)]
*  They say, what the fuck you mean they say? [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2254.4s)]
*  Who was they? [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2258.4s)]
*  They say I was selling drugs. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2259.4s)]
*  It was just terrible, man. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2264.4s)]
*  Now, does she immediately, is she furious? [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2266.4s)]
*  Does she step into mom mode where she's like, I need to protect you? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2269.4s)]
*  She cry first. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2272.4s)]
*  OK, she cry first. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2273.4s)]
*  Oh, that's heartbreaking. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2274.4s)]
*  And you on the phone like this. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2275.4s)]
*  God damn. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2277.4s)]
*  And you, this is how you turn the phone up. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2278.4s)]
*  You been deflated. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2286.4s)]
*  Damn. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2287.4s)]
*  I ain't going to buy her shit. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2290.4s)]
*  You like, man. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2295.4s)]
*  And she's like, what you at? [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2297.4s)]
*  I'm like, I'm in the county, man. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2298.4s)]
*  What's your bond? [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2300.4s)]
*  And she was like, and I'm like, hey, we can make this bond. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2301.4s)]
*  And she's like, what? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2305.4s)]
*  Man, you don't remember I used to come to your house and plant stuff in your garden. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2307.4s)]
*  Like, yeah, you're going to have to dig them begonias up. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2314.4s)]
*  My mom was pissed. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2319.4s)]
*  That line killed me in the spell. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2321.4s)]
*  You didn't dig up them begonias. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2323.4s)]
*  But she was pissed, bro. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2325.4s)]
*  My mom was. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2328.4s)]
*  Because she, it's like real time, I was not honoring everything that she had been through to make our life good. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2329.4s)]
*  And I think that's what people don't think about. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2340.4s)]
*  Just like even now, these kids that's in the streets, you don't want to honor your family. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2344.4s)]
*  Family sacrifice. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2350.4s)]
*  You rather do some dishonorable shit. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2351.4s)]
*  And to appease people that don't really have any type of, they have nothing to do with your life. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2353.4s)]
*  Akash had like, we were just talking about your specials. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2363.4s)]
*  And Akash had like, I thought a really great take on especially domino effects. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2367.4s)]
*  And I want you to say more about like this idea that like you take accountability for your actions. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2372.4s)]
*  A lot of times, you know, especially in comedy, a lot of us are talking about the things that have forced us into these situations. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2378.4s)]
*  We are the victims. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2384.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2385.4s)]
*  And it's like so sad for me. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2386.4s)]
*  It's like a cool, rare take where it's like, no, I made these decisions and I did this stuff. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2387.4s)]
*  And I think it's very easy to be like, well, society made me or these things made me. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2392.4s)]
*  But even now, as you talk about, you're like, no, no, I disrespected my mom's sacrifice. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2398.4s)]
*  She did everything that she could have done to make me not do these things. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2403.4s)]
*  I thought that that was, I thought it's a brave take. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2407.4s)]
*  I think that's a huge thing about honor. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2409.4s)]
*  And so when you hang out with other ethnic groups, other cultures, they have a big thing. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2414.4s)]
*  Like, I don't know not one Pakistani guy that I asked a person to know that's not what his parents told him to be. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2420.4s)]
*  I don't know not one Indian guy that doesn't do what his parents told him to do. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2428.4s)]
*  He fucked up. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2434.4s)]
*  You think my parents told me to do this? [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2436.4s)]
*  I tried. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2438.4s)]
*  I tried. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2439.4s)]
*  You tried. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2440.4s)]
*  I tried as hard as I could. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2441.4s)]
*  You gave it a try. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2442.4s)]
*  His mom thinks he's in the circus. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2443.4s)]
*  You know, and that's the thing that we lose honor within this society. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2448.4s)]
*  I want you to go out and just be a good functioning human being. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2455.4s)]
*  No, fuck that. I want a drill. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2459.4s)]
*  What? [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2461.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2462.4s)]
*  And you start to take on America's theme of the bad guy. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2463.4s)]
*  Everybody want to be the bad guy. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2469.4s)]
*  Get money at any cost. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2472.4s)]
*  Good guys finish last. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2473.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2474.4s)]
*  No, they don't. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2475.4s)]
*  No, they really don't. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2476.4s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2477.4s)]
*  They finish safe. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2478.4s)]
*  Yeah, you seem last. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2479.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2480.4s)]
*  Yeah, they finish safe. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2481.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2482.4s)]
*  And it's a, my favorite line of all of the specials is, it seems like I'm the only one [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2483.4s)]
*  locked up for what I did. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2491.4s)]
*  Why? [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2494.4s)]
*  Because everybody else was, I was in this, they framed me. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2495.4s)]
*  I'm like, they framed you. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2498.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2500.4s)]
*  You just finished robbing somebody two cells over. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2501.4s)]
*  I think they got you pretty fucking big down. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2505.4s)]
*  You still here robbing? [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2508.4s)]
*  Who do you think? [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2511.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2512.4s)]
*  You know, it's embarrassing. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2513.4s)]
*  I had, we were doing a pod, but Charlotte and I had a guy in the pod and it's just like [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2514.4s)]
*  great stories and hilarious, but he ended up getting locked up for, I think it was like [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2519.4s)]
*  10 years and for something he didn't do. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2522.4s)]
*  And I asked him and I was like, can I just ask you, did you do other shit that you should've [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2524.4s)]
*  got locked up for? [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2529.76s)]
*  And he goes, I should be in here for 200 years. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2530.76s)]
*  So it's like, maybe they didn't get you for the one. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2533.4s)]
*  But they were so- [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2537.6s)]
*  Like Al Capone. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2538.6s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2539.6s)]
*  Capone like evaded taxes or whatever. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2540.6s)]
*  But that motherfucker deserved to be locked up with diarrhea or whatever. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2541.6s)]
*  And then what he died of syphilis. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2544.4s)]
*  Syphilis. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2546.4s)]
*  It's like, hey, it's like, hey, can't get you on this, but that's where pussy got it. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2547.4s)]
*  It takes that syphilis to go off. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2555.4s)]
*  It's a thing even in comedy. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2558.4s)]
*  You have this thing where people feel like you owe me something in comedy. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2563.4s)]
*  I'm supposed to, or you have this entitlement. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2572.4s)]
*  And I'm like, nah, it really doesn't work like that. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2576.4s)]
*  So I'm, a lot of times comics, especially young comics, used to be mad at me, especially [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2580.4s)]
*  when I was in the club. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2584.4s)]
*  I would come in, I'm headlining and I'm putting all of your stuff out of the green room. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2586.4s)]
*  Because this is an earned space. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2594.4s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2596.4s)]
*  I didn't come with you. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2597.4s)]
*  If you didn't come with me, then this is not your space. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2599.4s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2604.4s)]
*  I have to earn this space. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2605.4s)]
*  It's like I had to earn it. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2606.4s)]
*  Damon Waynes was at my home club at the Emperor of Houston. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2609.4s)]
*  Great club, by the way. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2614.4s)]
*  And he asked for me to come. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2615.4s)]
*  Oh, they asked for me to come. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2619.4s)]
*  He didn't know who I was. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2621.4s)]
*  They asked for me to come. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2622.4s)]
*  And I get there Saturday, no, Friday. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2623.4s)]
*  I do Friday, Saturday, Sunday. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2627.4s)]
*  Somebody had, he had replaced his feature for Thursday. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2629.4s)]
*  He didn't like him. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2632.4s)]
*  And I had just came into town. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2634.4s)]
*  They asked me to come. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2635.4s)]
*  So I came up there. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2637.4s)]
*  I never went in the green room. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2639.4s)]
*  Out of respect for him. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2641.4s)]
*  Then Sunday, he had his son-in-law. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2642.4s)]
*  Hey, man, can you get out of here for me? [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2645.4s)]
*  I came in the green room. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2647.4s)]
*  He said, I understand this is your home club. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2649.4s)]
*  I'm like, yeah. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2652.4s)]
*  Why didn't you come in this green room? [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2654.4s)]
*  I said, I wasn't invited. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2657.4s)]
*  He said, you old school. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2660.4s)]
*  I'm like, very much so. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2662.4s)]
*  Because now, say you got all your stuff in the green room. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2665.4s)]
*  Dick Gregory takes a nap between the shows. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2668.4s)]
*  So you going in and out of the door while he's in. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2672.4s)]
*  If you come with, if I came with you, then yes, I'm in there. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2674.4s)]
*  You know the expectation. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2679.4s)]
*  But if I did not come with you, I'm not going in the green room. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2680.4s)]
*  I don't know what you got going on in there. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2683.4s)]
*  It's not my space yet. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2685.4s)]
*  You have to earn the space. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2687.4s)]
*  And the feature wants to, the opener wants to, hey, man, no. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2691.4s)]
*  Because I didn't come up like that. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2698.4s)]
*  I came up under, this is the space for the headline. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2700.4s)]
*  Get himself together. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2703.4s)]
*  Feature and host, y'all find somewhere in the club to be. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2705.4s)]
*  And that's what it is. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2709.4s)]
*  And they never understood it. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2712.4s)]
*  But then you get to the space where it's yours. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2714.4s)]
*  And then you understand. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2717.4s)]
*  Hey, man, I'm in here. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2719.4s)]
*  I'm in there trying to get my mind together. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2721.4s)]
*  You in here talking about some other shit. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2723.4s)]
*  God knows what. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2725.4s)]
*  You in here arguing with your wife while I'm fucking trying to get my mind together. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2726.4s)]
*  I'm like, get your ass out of here. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2730.4s)]
*  I don't want that type of energy. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2734.4s)]
*  And especially if I don't know you. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2736.4s)]
*  It's like going on a roll. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2739.4s)]
*  Like this new thing that people do. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2740.4s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2742.4s)]
*  You probably get this. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2743.4s)]
*  You'll go in on Instagram or somebody that messaged you. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2745.4s)]
*  Hey, are you coming to Seattle? [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2748.4s)]
*  I would like to be your opener. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2750.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2752.4s)]
*  I don't know you. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2753.4s)]
*  This is not about you being funny. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2755.4s)]
*  I don't know you. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2757.4s)]
*  And being in this space is an intimate space. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2759.4s)]
*  You want your friends around you. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2763.4s)]
*  I'm not some strange person. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2766.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2769.4s)]
*  That you have no idea who they are. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2770.4s)]
*  So then you put them on the show and then you listening. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2773.4s)]
*  Yeah, I fucked the elephant last night. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2776.4s)]
*  What? [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2778.4s)]
*  My audience don't agree with this. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2779.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2781.4s)]
*  There's a version of it where it's also you're curating like a night for those people in the audience. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2782.4s)]
*  And you're putting in a variable that you really don't know what could happen. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2789.4s)]
*  And I think a lot of us come up where like I just want the opportunity to open for somebody. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2794.4s)]
*  And you think that maybe by opening for them, maybe they'll take you on the road. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2798.4s)]
*  And that does happen. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2801.4s)]
*  It is awesome. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2802.4s)]
*  But the best way I think it's ever been done is like comics will ask to open and they'll just send a joke. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2803.4s)]
*  And if I watch a joke and I think the guy's like hilarious, I'll be like, oh shit, this is awesome. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2810.4s)]
*  Yeah, it'd be great to have like a local guy on. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2815.4s)]
*  But the entitlement of just yeah, let me do 15 minutes in front. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2817.4s)]
*  It's like, do you not think that I don't have like some friends I've been doing comedy with this whole time that I would love to give that opportunity? [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2820.4s)]
*  But we have an hour and a half to do this show. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2827.4s)]
*  I think a lot of times maybe when you're young in comedy and I'm sure I'm guilty of this, it's like you don't think about like what the headliner is creating as a night for the audience. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2829.4s)]
*  And it's important to not interrupt that. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2838.4s)]
*  The best way for me is to use someone who knows me. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2841.4s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2847.4s)]
*  That knows you. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2848.4s)]
*  Oh. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2849.4s)]
*  I got on the first time I ever opened for DL. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2852.4s)]
*  Malik S. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2857.4s)]
*  Called me. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2859.4s)]
*  And then DL like, yo, I want him to do the show. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2862.4s)]
*  Like, if I send somebody to DL, hey, DL, you in Cincinnati, if you can allow this person. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2867.4s)]
*  It's coming from me. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2877.4s)]
*  If anything happens, it's on me. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2879.4s)]
*  You don't have any type of buffer. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2882.4s)]
*  Yo, it's funny. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2884.4s)]
*  The guy who sent me a clip asked me to wreck him for someone else who was in town. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2886.4s)]
*  And it does make it so much easier in that way when your friend who you believe in their comedy goes, yo, this kid is nice. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2891.4s)]
*  He's funny and he's familiar with their stuff. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2898.4s)]
*  He's not going to fucking elephant on the stage or whatever. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2900.4s)]
*  Because that shit is important. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2902.4s)]
*  I don't think that like people realize I don't want to call it our anxiety. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2903.4s)]
*  But like when you when you create something and I like calling it art because I think it art when you create it with those expectations, you don't want to disrupt that. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2907.4s)]
*  Don't want to disrupt it. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2916.4s)]
*  It's like you have to get validation and you have to get passed. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2918.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2922.4s)]
*  You know, from somebody else to somebody else, everything in my career, I've got passed. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2923.4s)]
*  I got on the show because of Eric Abrams. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2928.4s)]
*  Oh, Abrams suggested you to art. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2931.4s)]
*  Yeah. And that's the that's where it came from. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2933.4s)]
*  Yeah. And Eric Abrams has directed every special I've done. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2936.4s)]
*  Really? [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2942.4s)]
*  It's just Eric and Jordan. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2943.4s)]
*  You're keeping that guy in the work. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2945.4s)]
*  Me, Eric, Jordan, Joe, Matt. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2947.4s)]
*  Wow. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2949.4s)]
*  We just just the four. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2950.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2953.4s)]
*  Four wives meaning me. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2954.4s)]
*  It's like we just rolling. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2955.4s)]
*  And if somebody else before they bring somebody else on, it's always a conversation. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2957.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2963.4s)]
*  You know, it's not, oh, this is this is such and such. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2964.4s)]
*  It's just a weird thing. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2967.4s)]
*  And I think that now younger comics have gotten entitled where we owe them something. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2968.4s)]
*  But what bones do you know that I that I made? [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2974.4s)]
*  Like, what do you know about my career? [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2978.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2980.4s)]
*  Other than, oh, you see, especially. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2981.4s)]
*  No, I've been doing Santa for 27 years. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2982.4s)]
*  I think what some might know is that you're going to have sold out shows that weekend and they can't wait to get in front of sold out crowds. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2985.4s)]
*  So you want to skip the club and come to the theater. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2993.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2997.4s)]
*  And the theater is a different monster. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=2999.4s)]
*  This is something that I think is important. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3003.4s)]
*  I think a lot of comics learn is silences in theaters are very different than silences in a small club. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3005.4s)]
*  You've got to be very comfortable owning those moments. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3013.4s)]
*  And that's a skill you learn. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3017.4s)]
*  Like theaters expose jokes that aren't ready yet. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3018.4s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3021.4s)]
*  Jokes and people. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3024.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3025.4s)]
*  It's a thing. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3027.4s)]
*  And a hundred people being quiet is different than two thousand. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3029.4s)]
*  It's a different different monster. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3036.4s)]
*  You're right. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3040.4s)]
*  And then you have to even when you first when you first start doing theaters, did you realize how tired you were after the show versus when you were doing clubs? [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3041.4s)]
*  Yeah, there's a different I think it's because you put so much hours like I you know, my journey was I was doing a show. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3050.4s)]
*  I was doing clubs kind of pretty early and I did like three or four rounds before I ever even got a door deal. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3058.4s)]
*  Like I did maybe two rounds of clubs where I was selling them out and I got those bullshit bonuses they give you. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3065.4s)]
*  Yeah. Where you sell out the whole weekend. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3071.4s)]
*  They're like, well, here's five hundred dollars. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3072.4s)]
*  Five extra hundred dollars. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3074.4s)]
*  And I was like, I'm rich. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3075.4s)]
*  The club made a hundred grand on me that week. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3079.4s)]
*  I'm so excited. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3082.4s)]
*  But I think I did that a few times. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3084.4s)]
*  So, yeah, you start to understand the pacing of that of that size room. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3086.4s)]
*  And then when you first make that jump into the theater, I definitely remember it's like, oh, that joke wasn't ready yet. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3090.4s)]
*  I could sell it in the club. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3096.4s)]
*  But the theater and the joke wasn't developed enough for the theater. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3098.4s)]
*  I couldn't hold the tension enough in that joke. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3102.4s)]
*  That punch line wasn't strong enough to make them erupt. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3104.4s)]
*  And it is it is like a luxury and privilege to do those big rooms. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3107.4s)]
*  But I will say like it will sharpen your comedy in a very special way. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3112.4s)]
*  I'm not even talking about the material. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3116.4s)]
*  I'm talking about your body. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3118.4s)]
*  Because in a comedy club, it was you. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3120.4s)]
*  Twenty steps this way. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3123.4s)]
*  Twenty steps that way. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3124.4s)]
*  You can engage them. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3125.4s)]
*  You're right. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3126.4s)]
*  Twenty and twenty. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3127.4s)]
*  You're not really putting you put maybe an extra hundred steps in your life. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3128.4s)]
*  A theater. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3135.4s)]
*  I can't sit right here. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3136.4s)]
*  I got to go over there. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3139.4s)]
*  I got to go. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3140.4s)]
*  So I done done three miles on this stage. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3141.4s)]
*  Bang for three miles. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3146.4s)]
*  You know, you know, something that like I think it helped me for theaters is like when I would do clubs in the city and I've noticed you've done this as well. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3149.4s)]
*  You do it. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3157.4s)]
*  But like I would sit down and I would try to use like as little energy as possible. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3158.4s)]
*  And it was it was really like testing if the jokes were strong enough to carry it on its own. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3163.4s)]
*  I was like, I know I can perform these things, but like what if I just kind of clip my wings and see if the joke can carry it? [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3169.4s)]
*  Probably. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3176.4s)]
*  Because you can we can all like dance up a joke in a small room. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3178.4s)]
*  But like if you can take almost everything away from it and just focus on that connection. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3182.4s)]
*  And I've seen a lot of your stuff and I know you talk about walking around, but you'll be seated. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3187.4s)]
*  And you'll let them come to you. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3191.4s)]
*  And I think it's like developing that ability to hold attention while not doing anything is crucial for going into these bigger venues because even taking a few steps to somebody that's on the top, top balcony, that just looks like sitting down to them. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3193.4s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3209.4s)]
*  So I did the beacon. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3211.4s)]
*  And I knew that I didn't want a whole store feature. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3213.4s)]
*  I just wanted to do it myself. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3218.4s)]
*  It was a thing. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3220.4s)]
*  The old last year you came. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3222.4s)]
*  Somebody opened up the Iran Davis, you know, of course. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3224.4s)]
*  Yeah, I love how he's great came out. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3227.4s)]
*  But in my mind, this time is just me and the people. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3229.4s)]
*  Peter Parker, great DJ. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3234.4s)]
*  He did his thing. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3236.4s)]
*  And then when the lights went out, I heard this eruptions like they knew. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3238.4s)]
*  And I felt like when I was at the DMX concert, I just started screaming for no reason. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3247.4s)]
*  I knew he was coming. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3252.4s)]
*  So when I walked out, they didn't they realized didn't know that I was coming out first. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3267.4s)]
*  Oh, so it was a real surprise for them. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3274.4s)]
*  They're expecting an opener. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3275.4s)]
*  And then I watched the whole place erupt. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3277.4s)]
*  Oh, no, that's him. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3281.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3283.4s)]
*  And this lady DM me and said, it's crazy because I've never done this before. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3284.4s)]
*  You walked out and I was so excited. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3292.4s)]
*  I just start crying. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3295.4s)]
*  And I was like, I'm Michael Jackson. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3297.4s)]
*  And it was like a great compliment that she was so excited. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3303.4s)]
*  And like, I've been that excited to see. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3307.4s)]
*  How many people in your life? [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3312.4s)]
*  Who? [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3313.4s)]
*  X. Yeah. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3314.4s)]
*  It's like, damn, man. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3315.4s)]
*  Damn, it was crazy. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3317.4s)]
*  And he when he did a movie premiere in Houston, and he was sitting right in front of me. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3319.4s)]
*  And my boy was like, you losing her? [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3326.4s)]
*  You losing her? [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3328.4s)]
*  I'm like, fucking right. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3329.4s)]
*  So he shot a video. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3333.4s)]
*  He shot his video in Galveston. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3336.4s)]
*  Which song? [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3338.4s)]
*  I forget the song that he shot in Galveston, but you probably they can probably find it. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3339.4s)]
*  But his crew was at this club called Cloud Nine. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3344.4s)]
*  And this is back when I was drinking Hennessy like crazy. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3350.4s)]
*  I was a crazy person. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3354.4s)]
*  So I get thrown out the club because I was standing on their furniture. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3356.4s)]
*  And I wouldn't stop. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3360.4s)]
*  So I'm out of the club. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3361.4s)]
*  And this dude named Wham from Chicago Wham come out and Wham was like a big time gangster. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3363.4s)]
*  He was the only person I ever seen being able to carry a shotgun in the club. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3373.4s)]
*  I don't even think he had no license or nothing. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3377.4s)]
*  So he comes out. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3380.4s)]
*  Who was standing on my goddamn furniture? [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3381.4s)]
*  And I was like, I'm so drunk. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3383.4s)]
*  I'm like, I was standing on your furniture. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3385.4s)]
*  And he's like, Ali, you need to cut this shit out. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3387.4s)]
*  So some other dudes named Fats and they from Queens, they start laughing. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3389.4s)]
*  I'm like, fuck y'all laughing about. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3395.4s)]
*  And when they threw me out, it's like the parking lot is gravel. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3397.4s)]
*  So I kind of slid and the rough riders was on this bus. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3403.4s)]
*  And I was like, yo, y'all can get it. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3408.4s)]
*  And everybody on that fucking bus can get it. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3411.4s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3413.4s)]
*  So they get on the bus and they walking towards me and Wham got a shotgun saying, now y'all ain't gonna fuck with him. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3416.4s)]
*  He was saying, Ali, go back in the club. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3421.4s)]
*  I'm like, no, no, no, Wham. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3423.4s)]
*  What they talking about? [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3425.4s)]
*  I'm like, yo, you know you losing your fucking mind right now. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3427.4s)]
*  I went back in the club and about, I'm gonna give you 10 minutes. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3431.4s)]
*  I'm right back on that goddamn furniture. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3438.4s)]
*  This girl named Sanobia was dancing on the furniture. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3441.4s)]
*  And he was like, Ali is fucking terribly drunk right now. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3444.4s)]
*  Rough riders in the club at this point? [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3451.4s)]
*  No, they're still outside. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3453.4s)]
*  And Capone, because this coming from here, Capone brings me here. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3455.4s)]
*  I'm doing BBQs and it's a little box. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3462.4s)]
*  And I'm like, Capone, I need a stool. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3466.4s)]
*  He said, nothing can fit up here. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3469.4s)]
*  I'm like, no, I need a chair. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3470.4s)]
*  And the microphone comes down and then I'm doing my thing. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3472.4s)]
*  And the rough riders are upstairs. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3476.4s)]

*  I said, you know something, y'all ain't gonna do nothing to me. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3499.4s)]
*  Because if I go out there and push them bikes over, y'all gonna cry. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3501.4s)]
*  That's the real domino thing. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3505.4s)]
*  And we had a good time. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3509.4s)]
*  They knew I was fucked up. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3514.4s)]
*  Did you ever get to meet X? [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3516.4s)]
*  Just at the move. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3519.4s)]
*  Just at that moment. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3520.4s)]
*  That was before all this happened though, right? [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3521.4s)]
*  He didn't remember you from trying to fight his entire crew. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3524.4s)]
*  He wasn't there. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3527.4s)]
*  They was already setting up in Galveston. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3528.4s)]
*  They was headed to Galveston, but they stopped the party. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3531.4s)]
*  But I remember being that excited to see it. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3534.4s)]
*  It's like I could relate to everything that he was saying. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3539.4s)]
*  It's not like a lot of new rappers. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3542.4s)]
*  I don't relate to none of this shit they be saying. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3545.4s)]

*  Really? [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3551.4s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a break for a second. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3552.4s)]
*  There's some copy here. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3553.4s)]
*  Let me just tell you what I want to say. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3554.4s)]
*  They turn supplements into gummy bears, and it's absolutely fantastic. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3556.4s)]
*  I walk into the office. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3560.4s)]
*  I grab a pack of these gummy bears. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3562.4s)]
*  I pick them up, I tear it, and I eat it, and they're delicious. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3564.4s)]
*  And then afterwards, I get to feel good about it. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3566.4s)]
*  I don't get to feel like I ate gummy bears. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3568.4s)]
*  I get to feel like I got my daily supplements. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3570.4s)]
*  This is genius. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3572.4s)]
*  Groons! [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3573.4s)]
*  Am I pronouncing it right? [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3575.4s)]
*  Groons? [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3576.4s)]
*  Because I saw that little oom lot, so I assumed it was Groons. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3577.4s)]
*  Everyone in the studio is eating these every single day. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3580.4s)]
*  Probably too many packs a day. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3582.4s)]
*  I would like to show you what they look like. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3584.4s)]
*  We ate them all. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3586.4s)]
*  Because it is a fantastic snack, and it's actually good for you. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3587.4s)]
*  It's low in sugar, gut-healthy, and has immunity and cognition benefits. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3590.4s)]
*  You want a supplement that you can enjoy. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3595.4s)]
*  This isn't a chore. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3597.4s)]
*  It's not something disgusting that you're just eating so you can live forever. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3598.4s)]
*  This is the thing that you want to eat nonstop. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3602.4s)]
*  I would eat it for four meals a day if I could. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3605.4s)]
*  The point is you got to go to www.gruns.co, and you're getting up to 52% off. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3607.4s)]

*  Now let's get back to the show. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3618.4s)]
*  Alright guys, let's take a break real quick. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3619.4s)]
*  I'm literally going to eat this right now because we have to record for three more hours. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3620.4s)]
*  I'm not going to have time for food. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3624.4s)]
*  This is the healthiest, best protein bar on the market. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3625.4s)]
*  It's a protein bar with a simple concept. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3629.4s)]
*  It's the most protein with the fewest calories. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3630.4s)]
*  28 grams of protein, 150 calories. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3632.4s)]
*  You know how insane that is for a protein bar? [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3635.4s)]
*  Most of the time if it's got 28 grams of protein, it's like 300, 400 calories. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3637.4s)]
*  They cut that shit in half. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3641.4s)]
*  It's fantastic. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3642.4s)]

*  Buy these. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3645.4s)]
*  Adequate protein intake is critical for building and preserving muscle now and as we age. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3646.4s)]
*  It also plays a vital role in metabolic health, preventing excess body fat accumulation. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3651.4s)]
*  Listen, I'm trying to get less fat. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3657.4s)]
*  I'm eating one of these every day. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3659.4s)]
*  I think it's working so far. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3661.4s)]
*  So that's all you need to know. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3662.4s)]

*  Right. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3788.4s)]
*  So as I constantly listened, it made sense. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3789.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3795.4s)]
*  You know, and I was like, my first, and then you said your knee jerk reaction was to go [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3796.4s)]
*  with it. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3802.4s)]
*  And my knee jerk reaction, I'm not fucking with you. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3803.4s)]
*  And it made more sense because that's what happens with us a lot. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3806.4s)]
*  It's people that don't fuck with me, period. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3811.4s)]
*  And they probably don't even know you. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3813.4s)]
*  It's a headline or one line that you said. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3815.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3817.4s)]
*  This is, and this is like, I think we're all guilty of this shit. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3818.4s)]
*  And that's why I kind of have empathy when people are saying these certain things. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3820.4s)]
*  It's like the version of me that you think I am, I probably would feel the same way as [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3823.4s)]
*  you. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3828.4s)]
*  That's just not who I am. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3829.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3831.4s)]
*  It's like people got mad at me because I said something about Tupac. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3832.4s)]
*  Well, he was a fucking dancer when I met him. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3836.4s)]
*  You mad at me for the truth? [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3840.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3842.4s)]
*  He was dancing. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3843.4s)]
*  I'm like, this is public record. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3844.4s)]
*  This is public knowledge. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3846.4s)]
*  What did you say about him being a dancer? [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3848.4s)]
*  I just said, when I met Tupac, I'm already in the streets. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3851.4s)]
*  So when I meet him, he's with Digital Underground. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3858.4s)]
*  I meet him with Digital Underground. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3861.4s)]
*  Where he be? [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3863.4s)]
*  I'm sitting there, he's in an elevator. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3864.4s)]
*  He's there in Houston for a music conference. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3865.4s)]
*  I meet him then. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3868.4s)]
*  It wasn't the Thug Life Tupac at the time. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3870.4s)]
*  But why would it be when I'm already in the streets? [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3873.4s)]
*  I wouldn't have looked at him like that. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3877.4s)]
*  So then when I go to prison, then I hear all the rest of this shit. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3879.4s)]
*  And I was like, oh, okay. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3883.4s)]
*  But I didn't see it. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3886.4s)]
*  I never saw him in concert. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3888.4s)]
*  I never saw Biggie in concert. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3890.4s)]
*  My shit started at 14. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3892.4s)]
*  They wasn't in the streets like that when I was coming up. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3896.4s)]
*  Why did this make people so mad? [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3901.4s)]
*  Because they got some love affair with a person that they don't know. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3903.4s)]
*  It's people that was in my DM that probably wouldn't defend their mom like this. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3908.4s)]
*  You want to honor your family, but you want to honor the legacy of Tupac [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3916.4s)]
*  when you want to honor your family. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3923.4s)]
*  I don't think there's one person on this planet that I actually don't know that I would defend. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3926.4s)]
*  That vehemently. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3935.4s)]
*  That I'm going to take my time out to say a threatening message to you, incriminate myself on the Internet. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3937.4s)]
*  I was like, okay. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3948.4s)]
*  And then in my mind, I'm like, people don't understand. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3950.4s)]
*  I never said I was the toughest dude. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3956.4s)]
*  I'm just willing to defend myself with everything that I have in my family. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3958.4s)]
*  You don't have to be tough for that. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3964.4s)]
*  I think some people call that toughness, for sure. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3967.4s)]
*  But the level that I'm going to go through to defend myself is crazy down. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3970.4s)]
*  You can't even imagine the type of shit I do to defend myself. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3979.4s)]
*  But now you're at a level where... [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3986.4s)]
*  And people say that shit all the time. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3989.4s)]
*  I don't give a shit about you. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3991.4s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3993.4s)]
*  You got so much to lose. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3997.4s)]
*  No, no, not that. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=3999.4s)]
*  Because this is something I deal with specifically with the situation you just brought up where it's just like... [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4001.4s)]
*  You get to a level where people know you so casually. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4006.4s)]
*  Earlier in your career, they probably know you intimately. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4010.4s)]
*  Your super fans have seen probably 10 hours of your comedy. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4013.4s)]
*  They know everything that you... [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4017.4s)]
*  They know if you say this about Tupac, they're like, yeah, because he met him when he was a dancer. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4019.4s)]
*  They know everything about you. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4022.4s)]
*  The people that listen to the podcast religiously, they know everything about us. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4023.4s)]
*  So when they hear some stupid rumor on the Internet like that, it was like, yeah, that's not Schultz at all. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4027.4s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4032.4s)]
*  But the people that know you casually, the bigger you get, the more people know you casually and will start having opinions about you based on that casual nature that will be wrong. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4033.4s)]
*  That's where I start to go. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4043.4s)]
*  If you fight every single wrong opinion about you as you reach superstardom, you'll never stop fighting. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4045.4s)]
*  Never stop fighting. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4051.4s)]
*  So there has to be a certain point where it's just like, I know you're willing to die for it. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4052.4s)]
*  But for the person that doesn't even know you, does that make sense? [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4056.4s)]
*  OK, I'll go with that. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4062.4s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4064.4s)]
*  I'm wishing you well. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4065.4s)]
*  I feel like a party is like, still, if they call me out my name, I'm still going to... [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4069.4s)]
*  Yeah, yo, it's like, you don't need them wherever. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4073.4s)]
*  They got to know there's a cost. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4078.4s)]
*  But you can't be paying that debt every single time because that is the nature of success. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4082.4s)]
*  I mean, we have this conversation all the time where it's just like, the cost of success is the lack of understanding of who you truly are. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4088.4s)]
*  There are people that think, who's the guy that plays Iron Man? [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4096.4s)]
*  Robert Downey Jr. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4099.4s)]
*  There are people that think Robert Downey Jr. is actually Iron Man. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4100.4s)]
*  They don't think he's some guy. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4103.4s)]
*  I actually love Robert Downey Jr. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4105.4s)]
*  Yeah, because he's Iron Man to you. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4107.4s)]
*  And it took me a long time to get back to him. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4109.4s)]
*  And I've always liked his shit. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4114.4s)]
*  But then he did Less Than Zero. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4117.4s)]
*  And I was like, I don't know. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4119.4s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4122.4s)]
*  What happened to Less Than Zero? [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4123.4s)]
*  It's some scene from when he had semen on his mouth. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4124.4s)]
*  I was like... [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4129.4s)]
*  I knew it was some gay shit. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4133.4s)]
*  I knew it was some gay shit. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4134.4s)]
*  Fucking Robert Downey Jr. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4136.4s)]
*  I was like, yo, it took me a while to get back. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4138.4s)]
*  And I watched all the Iron Man's. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4141.4s)]
*  He's like, he got me back. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4144.4s)]
*  It wasn't until he died in the ventures that you were like, I forgive him. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4147.4s)]
*  I was like, oh, come on with this bullshit, man. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4150.4s)]
*  This is the funniest thing too. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4156.4s)]
*  When he first gets locked up, he gets put on a block that is known as... [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4157.4s)]
*  They call it the sissy block. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4161.4s)]
*  It's all gay people. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4163.4s)]
*  And then there's some OG telling him like, he's like, I need out. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4164.4s)]
*  I can't believe they're thinking whatever. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4167.4s)]
*  And this is the crazy thing. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4169.4s)]
*  This is why I learned how to speak up for myself. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4171.4s)]
*  So the warden, when you get processed on this unit, the warden comes and he asks you questions. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4176.4s)]
*  And me being so fucking cavalier, he's like, well, you think you can protect yourself on this unit? [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4183.4s)]
*  And I said this. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4190.4s)]
*  I should have just said, this is why you got to be direct. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4191.4s)]
*  Yes or no? [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4194.4s)]
*  Me and my cavalier asked him, we'll see. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4196.4s)]
*  And he was like, okay, cool. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4199.4s)]
*  Put his ass on T2. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4201.4s)]
*  And I didn't know, right? [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4205.4s)]
*  So the first time we went to... [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4207.4s)]
*  This shit is so funny. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4211.4s)]
*  The first time we went to eat, all these fucking dudes... [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4213.4s)]
*  It's just bananas. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4215.4s)]
*  Spitting. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4216.4s)]
*  You're not even chewing. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4217.4s)]
*  I'm not even chewing. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4219.4s)]
*  I'm not even fucking... [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4220.4s)]
*  Spitting into the goddamn cafeteria. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4221.4s)]
*  And I come in last, I'm the last person. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4223.4s)]
*  And my boy Elliot was like, what the fuck is you doing over there? [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4227.4s)]
*  I'm like, I don't know. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4231.4s)]
*  Just where they put me. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4233.4s)]
*  He said, man, you got to get the fuck from over there. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4234.4s)]
*  Look at your cellies. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4237.4s)]

*  Hey, bro, I just need to be moved. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4327.4s)]
*  And old school, it ain't nothing but a couple ways to get moved. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4329.4s)]
*  Either they move you or you got to start beating people up. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4332.4s)]
*  And I asked him one more time to move me. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4336.4s)]
*  And they was like, no. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4341.4s)]
*  And then the shit went bad. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4343.4s)]
*  And old school was like, oh, come on, you're fucking the Cadillac up. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4346.4s)]
*  And I'm in there hitting people that they got shit to do with nothing. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4349.4s)]
*  So they take me out. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4356.4s)]
*  They put me in solitary for two days. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4358.4s)]
*  And the warden comes. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4360.4s)]
*  He said, I'm going to put your ass on the worst block over here. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4363.4s)]
*  And it was M Block. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4367.4s)]
*  I get to M Block. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4369.4s)]
*  And this is like home. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4371.4s)]
*  Like they in there gambling. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4373.4s)]
*  It's all type of foul prison shit going on over there. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4376.4s)]
*  And I'm sitting there like this. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4379.4s)]
*  Sleeping peacefully. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4381.4s)]
*  This is like I'm in the back of the Cadillac. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4384.4s)]
*  I'm good. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4389.4s)]
*  I just I didn't want to be associated. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4390.4s)]
*  That's a hard time to do. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4392.4s)]
*  Because then if you're there, people start thinking that you're there for a reason. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4394.4s)]
*  And then you could be a victim, right? [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4398.4s)]
*  You probably could be. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4400.4s)]
*  They would have found out. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4402.4s)]
*  They just misplaced him. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4404.4s)]
*  It was a bad situation. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4406.4s)]
*  So once I got to M Block, you were good. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4409.4s)]
*  It was straight. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4411.4s)]
*  And you knew enough people at M Block where I didn't know anybody on M Block. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4412.4s)]
*  And did anybody not try you on some gay shit, but anybody like test your like they heard why I got moved over. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4415.4s)]
*  So they were like, all right, we respect that motherfucker was not staying on that block. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4421.4s)]
*  And apparently other people had gone through that when you were beating up the guys on the sissy block. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4426.4s)]
*  Where did any of them enjoy it? [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4432.4s)]
*  Were they like, yeah, it's a passion. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4433.4s)]
*  I'm so mad. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4437.4s)]
*  What are you doing? [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4442.4s)]
*  Don't enjoy it. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4445.4s)]
*  Harder. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4447.4s)]
*  Fuck me. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4449.4s)]
*  Enjoying this beating. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4450.4s)]
*  Start punching yourself. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4452.4s)]
*  I don't know what to do. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4454.4s)]
*  Yo, prison just seems so crazy. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4456.4s)]
*  I never even thought I would be so fucking mad. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4458.4s)]
*  That's all it takes. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4460.4s)]
*  Some dudes are like, yes. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4462.4s)]
*  I'm going to keep that in mind if I ever go to prison. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4465.4s)]
*  If someone tries to fight me, I'm going to call him daddy immediately. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4467.4s)]
*  I'll be good. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4471.4s)]
*  That's not a safe word. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4474.4s)]
*  That is an awful word. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4479.4s)]
*  Oh, it's so bad. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4483.4s)]

*  Daddy. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4489.4s)]
*  He's strong. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4493.4s)]
*  How crazy is it that the CEOs made you do some shit, made you do some fucked up shit just so you could get to a place where you wouldn't do fucked up shit? [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4498.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4508.4s)]
*  I don't understand the whole, like how much control do you have over where you sleep in prison? [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4509.4s)]
*  Basically none until you got to kind of get known. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4515.4s)]
*  Does known mean like you curry favor with the CEOs or does known mean? [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4520.4s)]
*  Illustration. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4525.4s)]

*  Like where does that start? [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4579.4s)]
*  I imagine it's like a years long process. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4580.4s)]
*  Let me tell you where it started. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4582.4s)]
*  Because the funniest thing, when I got to Torres, they was in a crazy game situation. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4583.4s)]
*  It was a lot of riots. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4590.4s)]
*  I came from another unit with, I was considered an old head when I got to. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4592.4s)]
*  And you're 20 years old. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4598.4s)]
*  I'm 21. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4601.4s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm considered an old head. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4602.4s)]
*  Okay, OG. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4605.4s)]
*  I'm coming from a unit of old school cats. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4607.4s)]
*  Right, got it. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4611.4s)]
*  So when they send us there, they sent us there to get the unit under control. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4612.4s)]
*  Oh, there was too many young dudes who were causing problems. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4618.4s)]
*  Didn't know how to do time. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4621.4s)]
*  Got it, got it. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4623.4s)]
*  So they strategically will send some OGs there to get the young guys to kind of stay in line. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4624.4s)]
*  Hey, man, because let me tell you about old heads. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4630.4s)]
*  They're smart. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4634.4s)]
*  It's like understanding that the prisoners do run the prison to a certain extent. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4635.4s)]
*  So you can't just bully them into submission. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4641.4s)]
*  You have to kind of work with them. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4644.4s)]
*  You need a boss to go over. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4646.4s)]
*  Wow. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4647.4s)]
*  Like having a veteran in the locker room. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4648.4s)]
*  It's like, he don't even have to play, but he's going to keep everybody in line. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4650.4s)]
*  Hey, man, you can't, you don't want to do your time like that. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4655.4s)]
*  You explain to people, man, you don't want to do your time like this. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4658.4s)]
*  That's right. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4661.4s)]
*  They're coming in, it's their first bid and they just like, I'm going to act crazy like this. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4662.4s)]
*  Wow. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4665.4s)]
*  And the OGs need to come in and be like, dude, this is every day. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4666.4s)]
*  Calm the fuck down. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4670.4s)]
*  Let's pass this shit in the best way possible. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4672.4s)]
*  Talking to people. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4674.4s)]
*  So you get tapped. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4676.4s)]
*  How does he know that he can, this is kind of the interesting thing. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4677.4s)]
*  Are you already friends with Mendoza? [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4680.4s)]
*  Not friends, but do you already have like enough trust built up with him? [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4682.4s)]
*  Mendoza noticed that everybody on my block started enrolling in school. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4685.4s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4691.4s)]
*  Okay, so. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4693.4s)]
*  And I would come, I was the person that would, with the young, because you had different age groups and old heads go to different, you can talk to them. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4694.4s)]
*  You can talk to these group people. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4707.4s)]
*  So you had people that was already in the field that started enrolling in school and enrolling in trades because now you have somebody who's saying, so this how you going to do your time? [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4709.4s)]
*  What you going to go back outside with? [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4719.4s)]
*  To nothing. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4721.4s)]
*  Yeah, go outside there with some sort of education. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4722.4s)]
*  And I look like them. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4724.4s)]
*  I'm the same face. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4726.4s)]
*  It's just like now. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4728.4s)]
*  When I go to, when they ask me to come somewhere, I don't speak to children that's in trouble like I'm not a part of this trouble. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4730.4s)]
*  I don't go in with the, you got to do, I'm like, let me tell you what I was doing. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4742.4s)]
*  And let me tell you how embarrassing this was. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4747.4s)]
*  Let me show you how the road that you're going to end up. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4750.4s)]
*  If you continue to go down this road. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4757.4s)]
*  You know, let me show you the weakness in you by showing you how weak I was at this time. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4761.4s)]
*  That's why you never hear me glorifying selling drugs. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4768.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4772.4s)]
*  Because it was so crippling to my community. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4773.4s)]
*  I remember being Roy Bush Jr. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4776.4s)]
*  I tell this story, he still doesn't realize how him and Chris Cotton saved me. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4779.4s)]
*  Rest in peace Chris Cotton. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4786.4s)]
*  Save me. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4788.4s)]
*  We're doing, Comedy Central does a festival in San Francisco. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4789.4s)]
*  Okay. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4793.4s)]
*  And they're doing Ari's show, this not happening. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4794.4s)]
*  And I'm there to do the show, tell another story, whatever. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4798.4s)]
*  And I'm so depressed because I can't find a road to the theater that wasn't riddled with homeless drug users. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4803.4s)]
*  And I'm so sad because my mind keeps saying, what was the role that you played in this? [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4818.4s)]
*  In this. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4828.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4829.4s)]
*  It's probably the Fillmore that you were performing at. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4830.4s)]
*  Yeah, this is the offspring of your actions. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4832.4s)]
*  Your actions. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4836.4s)]
*  And it was, man, I would walk 10 blocks down to go down 10 blocks, come around and still with see. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4837.4s)]
*  And I was like, I was really depressed. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4847.4s)]
*  And when Roy asked me what story I was telling, and Chris Cotton was talking about what he was, what story he was telling. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4852.4s)]
*  And Roy told me the story he was telling about when he got booed at the Apollo. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4860.4s)]
*  And he was staying, he didn't really have no money to stay. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4866.4s)]
*  He was standing next to this prostitute doing her business. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4871.4s)]
*  And she had told him all these things she had to sleep with, and he had got booed. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4875.4s)]
*  And then he came, he was sitting on the steps and she walked up saying, it didn't go well, huh, baby? [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4880.4s)]
*  And he was like, nah. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4886.4s)]
*  He said, now you know when I told you about them dicks I was sucking? [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4888.4s)]
*  Some of them dicks had bumps on them. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4892.4s)]
*  Saying, what you got to keep doing what you got to keep doing. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4895.4s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4898.4s)]
*  Shit. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4899.4s)]
*  It could be worse. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4900.4s)]
*  And he said, it's going to be a bump in the road. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4901.4s)]
*  And I'm like, I am laughing hysterically. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4906.4s)]
*  And it kind of broke me up. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4912.4s)]
*  Roy, that is fucking awesomely funny. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4917.4s)]
*  You know, I go through these times where I blame myself for this, even this culture, how these kids, [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4921.4s)]
*  I was out there a while. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4937.4s)]
*  And that's what was my initial thing. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4940.4s)]
*  People say, well, when you think that you're going to get, you're going to blow up. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4947.4s)]
*  And I would always say, when I pay the universe back for the wrongs I've done. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4951.4s)]
*  And that's a big thing. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4957.4s)]
*  If you believe in energy, you believe in karma, the things that you did that was destructive, [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4960.4s)]
*  you have to rectify those things before you get to another level and be destructive again. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4965.4s)]
*  Like, I don't want to be destructive in my speech. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4974.4s)]
*  I don't not want to be a beacon of light for people. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4978.4s)]
*  That's why I don't mind telling the stories about prison because some people look at it like, oh, shit, I was in that same condition. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4984.4s)]
*  How can I do this? And I tell them now, this is not the goal. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4993.4s)]
*  The goal is to have a normal functioning life. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=4999.4s)]
*  You don't have to be a, because I don't consider myself no superstar. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5004.4s)]
*  I don't consider myself even a celebrity. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5008.4s)]
*  I'm not invited to shit. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5010.4s)]
*  I'm not a celebrity. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5014.4s)]
*  I don't mind being a goddamn thing. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5016.4s)]
*  I saw you at the time break. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5018.4s)]
*  I was on stage. I knew everybody up there. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5021.4s)]
*  I was behind the earthquake. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5024.4s)]
*  I saw you backstage before. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5026.4s)]
*  I saw you when you was on stage. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5028.4s)]
*  I was invited by my publicist. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5031.4s)]
*  Because the publicist that was running the thing, I was paying, I don't know what, damn, they should have got me a ticket. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5037.4s)]
*  All that fucking money I was paying for a month. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5044.4s)]
*  Crap, man, you're a pay up publicist. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5049.4s)]
*  Five grand, seven grand a month. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5051.4s)]
*  You do nothing. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5053.4s)]
*  Sometimes they are effective. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5055.4s)]
*  I think early in my career, I was like, this is a fucking waste of money. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5057.4s)]
*  But I will say this last run, I thought they did a really good job of getting, especially for guys like us who do YouTube and social media stuff, [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5060.4s)]
*  getting mainstream sources to pay attention to what we got going on. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5070.4s)]
*  It's almost like Hollywood and mainstream outlets have no clue the views that we're getting. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5073.4s)]
*  They're completely uneducated about what's happening on the Internet, which is where all the people actually are. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5078.4s)]
*  There's a huge disconnect, man. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5084.4s)]
*  You're talking about, I've been on the Emmy ballot three times. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5086.4s)]
*  And people with lesser material. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5092.4s)]
*  Don't seek justice in this business. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5097.4s)]
*  I stopped. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5101.4s)]
*  But the point, I keep plugging in this particular thing, the Emmys and the Grammys, because one of us had to win shows. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5103.4s)]
*  One of the independents had to eventually win. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5113.4s)]
*  And now the floodgates are open if one of us wins anything. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5117.4s)]
*  Yeah, I went out there for this like Emmys thing, this like introduction thing. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5124.4s)]
*  That basically Netflix pitches the people that they're hoping might be nominated and win. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5128.4s)]
*  And it was one of those things where it's like, I'll be honest, one of the execs came over like, listen, this isn't exactly like a meritocracy. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5133.4s)]
*  There are certain people that just kind of get nominated every year. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5139.4s)]
*  And I'm not trying to shoot on them. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5142.4s)]
*  I just think that there's like a lack of understanding of what we're doing. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5144.4s)]
*  And I'm very fortunate that it feels like, especially maybe even with the last special, the mainstream, for better, for worse, there's criticism. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5148.4s)]
*  But then there's some time celebration, at least is becoming more aware. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5157.4s)]
*  And that's why I've been paying attention to what's happening with you, because at a certain point, the numbers can't be ignored. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5161.4s)]
*  You know what I mean? It's like they just break through on their own. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5169.4s)]
*  And like I witnessed it happen for me, like even being invited to the Tom Brady thing. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5172.4s)]
*  Like Tom Brady thing was Sunday, just to put things in perspective. Friday and Saturday, I did Madison Square Garden. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5176.4s)]
*  So it's like that's where I was in my career. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5184.4s)]
*  And that's kind of always kind of looked at things in order to get that Tom Brady opportunity. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5187.4s)]
*  I need to first sell out Madison Square Garden twice in order to get JFL like new faces. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5191.4s)]
*  Remember that thing? Yeah, I had to have five shows on MTV. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5197.4s)]
*  And I'm looking at other people on new faces like they are new because I don't even know your face. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5201.4s)]
*  So like I just I've accepted that it might not be a meritocracy, but I'm going to have to work. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5208.4s)]
*  I don't care how many times harder. I'm just going to have to work to get it. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5214.4s)]
*  And that's literally why I was very excited for you to come on, because I'm seeing what's happening with you. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5217.4s)]
*  And is it delayed? And is the awareness from like maybe typical industry delayed? Yes. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5224.4s)]
*  But is it imminent? Absolutely. Because you cannot deny numbers and appreciation. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5232.4s)]
*  Skill you can deny. I think people deny skill all the time. But they cannot deny a wave of interest. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5240.4s)]
*  A community, an audience that really fucks with it. You cannot deny it. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5247.4s)]
*  And whether you get an Emmy or not, I feel like your audience won't care either what. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5250.4s)]
*  Because they know the real. They see it. They consume it. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5253.4s)]
*  You know, I sometimes you just reminded me of something about my trip, like with Montreal. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5257.4s)]
*  I get they call me and say, hey, man, you you you have Montreal. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5263.4s)]
*  They want you to come to Montreal and you're going to do like 60 of the dates. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5269.4s)]
*  But that theater is a smaller. You know, I wasn't invited to the gala or nothing. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5274.4s)]
*  Of course. Yeah. So and I asked, I said, for what? [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5278.4s)]
*  Like, what am I? Why am I going? [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5282.4s)]
*  It's like, what? I said, I don't want to go to Montreal. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5285.4s)]
*  I know this is the super bowl of comedy. I said, yeah. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5289.4s)]
*  What do you go there for? To get management to have a deal on it. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5293.4s)]
*  And at the time I had a deal with Comedy Central. I had an agency and I had management. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5301.4s)]
*  I said, did you all quit? [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5307.4s)]
*  It's like, no, but you just go and they had to really convince me to go. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5309.4s)]
*  I'm glad I went. It's an education process, dude. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5316.4s)]
*  It sounds crazy. I know it sounds crazy because because I know the exact position you're in, by the way, [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5319.4s)]
*  where it's just like you're doing bigger venues than these people that are getting like nominated for things. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5326.4s)]
*  You have bigger numbers and you're just looking at the raw data going, what the fuck am I missing here? [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5331.4s)]
*  But Hollywood is really a bubble. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5336.4s)]
*  Like even anytime I've done a movie, the only people that know me on the movie set are the guys that are like they're working the set, [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5339.4s)]
*  like the grips, the lighting, because they're the ones that are watching the real shit, right? [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5346.4s)]
*  They're not watching like, what is this avant-garde new like movie that's in French? [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5352.4s)]
*  They're like, if you say you like it shows, you have taste in cinema. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5357.4s)]
*  Like now the real people will kind of know. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5361.4s)]
*  And eventually that becomes so deniable it trickles through. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5363.4s)]
*  Would you do the Adam's family? Would you do Go Man's? [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5366.4s)]
*  Because I look like them? [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5371.4s)]
*  Yeah, you look like them. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5373.4s)]
*  They're fucking great Go Man's. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5375.4s)]
*  They're Spanish fluently. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5377.4s)]
*  If they're rebooting, maybe I'll check it out. I got to read the script for sure. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5379.4s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a break for a second. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5383.4s)]
*  Listen, we're in the same stuff that we were last week. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5386.4s)]
*  Not like anybody's noticing that, but we would like to bring it up because we're authentic. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5388.4s)]
*  What a finals, right? [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5392.4s)]
*  Listen, we are, we are. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5394.4s)]
*  I mean, unreal. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5396.4s)]
*  You know what's funny though is like we're recording this right now. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5398.4s)]
*  We have no clue if World War III has begun. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5401.4s)]
*  You know, like so so it is. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5404.4s)]
*  If it has begun, this is what life used to be like. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5407.4s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, it's like a little time capsule. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5409.4s)]
*  It is a time capsule. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5411.4s)]
*  Pretty nice. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5413.4s)]
*  I'm going to be dead right now. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5414.4s)]
*  Whoa, whoa, whoa. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5415.4s)]
*  You don't think they're getting over here? [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5417.4s)]
*  Why would you say that? [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5419.4s)]
*  I'm just saying. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5421.4s)]
*  You don't got Iron Dome yet. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5422.4s)]
*  I'm on vacation, bro. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5423.4s)]
*  Right now I'm on vacation. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5425.4s)]
*  So you're closer to the fucking fight. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5427.4s)]
*  Who knows I'm on vacation? [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5429.4s)]
*  Yeah, what are you doing right now? [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5430.4s)]
*  I can't tell you. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5432.4s)]
*  I'm not going to give up my location. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5434.4s)]
*  God forbid. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5436.4s)]
*  God forbid they do some sort of like targeted attack. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5438.4s)]
*  I'm not going to do it. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5440.4s)]
*  Point that I'm trying to make is that there is a big UFC fight that is this weekend if America still exists. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5441.4s)]
*  OK. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5447.4s)]
*  Where is it? [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5448.4s)]
*  Vegas. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5449.4s)]
*  Las Vegas. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5450.4s)]
*  Even if it doesn't exist, I have a feeling Dana is going to be like, yo, we're doing it. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5451.4s)]
*  He's going to make that fight. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5453.4s)]
*  He's going to make that fight. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5454.4s)]
*  It's happening. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5455.4s)]
*  100%. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5456.4s)]
*  It will be in the desert no matter what. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5457.4s)]
*  So yeah, Toporia versus Olivera. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5460.4s)]
*  Listen, with all due respect to Olivera, I can't see how Toporia loses this fight. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5462.4s)]
*  Same. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5466.4s)]
*  This Toporia guy is, Olivera gets touched. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5467.4s)]
*  He gets hit. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5470.4s)]
*  And he has amazing resilience. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5471.4s)]
*  Like he'll go down and then get back up. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5473.4s)]
*  But I just I can't see. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5475.4s)]
*  I can't see Toporia not connecting and I can't see him. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5478.4s)]
*  Yeah, he doesn't have the jiu-jitsu that Olivera does, but he's a great wrestler. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5482.4s)]
*  So I just I don't I don't see. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5485.4s)]
*  I think it's going one way. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5488.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5489.4s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know much of what I'm seeing of Toporia. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5490.4s)]
*  He's nice. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5492.4s)]
*  I'll tell you one thing that the fight before it is Pantoja versus Cara France. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5493.4s)]
*  Cara France. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5499.4s)]
*  Cara is a stylebender's boy and Pantoja is just an absolute menace. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5500.4s)]
*  That's going to be an interesting one right there. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5504.4s)]
*  That's going to be an absolute what is it a barn burner? [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5506.4s)]
*  Oh yeah, a barn burner. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5510.4s)]
*  Why is that a saying? [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5511.4s)]
*  I don't know, but Charles Barkley always struggles saying that's a barn burner. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5512.4s)]
*  Why does that why is that why do we describe that as like a good thing? [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5518.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5522.4s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5523.4s)]
*  I've never seen a barn burner. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5524.4s)]
*  I imagine it's probably pretty awesome though. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5525.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5526.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5527.4s)]

*  Racial undertone. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5532.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5533.4s)]

*  I don't know if you can, you can shit on this if you want to. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5570.4s)]

*  And I would go into agencies and be like, I'm on Wild'n Out. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5599.76s)]
*  And they'd be like, we're looking for like a two broke girls kind of show. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5602.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5605.679999999999s)]
*  And I know as an Indian, they want a certain narrative. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5606.679999999999s)]
*  I feel like with black people, it's a little bit like we want black people that we're not [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5609.24s)]
*  quite so scared of. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5612.68s)]
*  You're telling stories about some shit that's like. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5613.68s)]
*  They want the skin color to be diverse, but not necessarily the personality and experience. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5616.48s)]
*  And I don't know if that's like, I don't know if they're even aware of it. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5623.32s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5627.48s)]
*  Like, I wonder if it's like. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5628.48s)]
*  I remember there was a pilot and every pilot I've ever seen for an Indian is he's married [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5629.72s)]
*  to someone or in love with someone who's non-Indian or can't get someone at all. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5634.28s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, I just don't. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5638.92s)]
*  I had a holding deal with ABC and I was like, I don't really want to audition for this. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5640.639999999999s)]
*  I was in a position where I felt like I could say that. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5644.2s)]
*  And she was like, why? [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5646.12s)]
*  And I was like, well, I explained the reason. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5647.12s)]
*  White exec in L.A. And I don't think she wasn't racist at all. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5648.759999999999s)]
*  Poor girl truly didn't understand. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5651.639999999999s)]
*  She goes, but he's Indian. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5653.24s)]
*  Like that was she couldn't understand that. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5655.719999999999s)]
*  That's not something I want. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5657.4s)]
*  You should be happy. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5658.4s)]
*  You got something. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5659.5599999999995s)]
*  That is the perspective. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5660.96s)]
*  There was a thing I and I don't. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5662.44s)]
*  That's why it's so beautiful that we have YouTube and you got double digit million views [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5664.48s)]
*  on one special and like you get to talk to your people and do it your way. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5668.12s)]
*  And it's awesome. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5671.5199999999995s)]
*  But I do think within the industry, there's a little bit of that. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5672.96s)]
*  And not to discredit anything you're saying, you probably might be experiencing both. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5675.16s)]
*  But I think there's a little bit of that. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5678.44s)]
*  And I'd love to know your opinion on that. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5679.86s)]
*  I think we just isolated just to me because I can't speak for what they're looking for [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5682.639999999999s)]
*  because some things that. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5688.24s)]
*  I have done, they have accepted from other people. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5690.96s)]
*  I'm saying so, I don't think that. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5695.48s)]
*  I think because they have not made me, they didn't have their hands. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5700.16s)]
*  That is what it means to get this is a massive thing that like, it's interesting. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5703.8s)]
*  I think a lot of times people won't even like to admit it's taking ownership over someone's [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5707.5199999999995s)]
*  career is very important for people like they want to know. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5713.72s)]
*  Even back in the MTV days, like MTV to an MTV were separate. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5717.32s)]
*  And if you were popular on MTV to the MTV people, like, but that's not one of ours. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5721.44s)]
*  We want to do it. It's like it becomes part of their identity. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5726.12s)]
*  And when you are, quote unquote, made, I don't like self made, like made by the people, [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5729.4s)]
*  like the people decide community, they can't go. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5733.5199999999995s)]
*  We put him on exactly. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5736.88s)]
*  And I do. I do agree with you. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5739.8s)]
*  There is a little bit of a hesitation like they would. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5741.639999999999s)]
*  They've invested three specials or three things in this one person. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5744.4s)]
*  Rather, that person get this opportunity than this guy who did it on his own and forced his way in. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5747.32s)]
*  But I'm telling you, it reaches a breaking point. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5752.599999999999s)]
*  You know what? It's title feels like early kids like you feel like our guy, our secret that we consume [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5755.88s)]
*  and the rest of the world knows, even though clearly the rest of the world knows about you. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5764.759999999999s)]
*  But it's like it just feels like, oh, that's our guy. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5768.24s)]
*  And it's like we relate to everything. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5770.679999999999s)]
*  I'm speaking from the black point of view and have just got to a point where it's like, OK, [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5772.48s)]
*  undeniable, Hollywood had to pay attention. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5777.4s)]
*  And I feel like you're right there. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5780.2s)]
*  I don't even compare to to care because I'm so out the box, like totally in it. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5783.839999999999s)]
*  And I still love Kev, but Kev has Dave Becky, who's like the manager. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5795.839999999999s)]
*  Oh, I don't know about all the time. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5799.599999999999s)]
*  He had behind the scenes. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5801.0s)]
*  He had he had a machine, you know, three arts and David. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5803.08s)]
*  He had a lot going on. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5807.52s)]
*  It's no machine. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5809.76s)]
*  I'm in Houston and I'm generating what I'm doing from Houston, from my hometown, with my bread, [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5813.0s)]
*  with my own money. Yeah, like that's what I got. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5822.56s)]
*  It probably just feels like that to me just because I remembered Kev like when passing around the DVDs, [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5825.28s)]
*  like being at the barbershop. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5830.48s)]
*  And that's how I discovered Kevin Hart. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5831.44s)]
*  He got the DVDs and we gave him a pass. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5833.36s)]
*  I think I think you're right. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5834.639999999999s)]
*  In terms of like public perception, where it's like I think the perception early on in Kev's career [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5836.48s)]
*  is like he had some pilot. It didn't go. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5841.759999999999s)]
*  And then then it's like he's in the clubs. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5844.5199999999995s)]
*  I think on the street, people aren't aware of who your representation is. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5847.28s)]
*  It's more just like, oh, he's doing shows at Caroline's and he's grinding. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5851.48s)]
*  That's a normal thing for every comic. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5855.04s)]
*  Every comic has a story where they were selling their CDs and DVDs outside the club. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5858.08s)]
*  That's a normal thing. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5862.88s)]
*  That's not a it's not isolated to one to one person. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5865.76s)]
*  Yeah, I know I have people's DVDs that I use them as. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5869.12s)]
*  Remember this shit? [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5875.52s)]
*  I'll be going on that bullshit. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5880.24s)]
*  I'm like, I'm just saying I bought it. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5881.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I support it. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5884.799999999999s)]
*  And it's like it's like it's not I'm talking about before the DVDs. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5886.16s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5890.879999999999s)]
*  So you had what was no DVDs. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5891.679999999999s)]
*  You had just people that had their stuff on CD. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5895.879999999999s)]
*  Well, you would just listen. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5899.679999999999s)]
*  It was yeah, the audio. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5901.12s)]
*  Yeah, you just audio with a shitty printed cover. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5902.759999999999s)]
*  I mean, it was so good. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5907.5599999999995s)]
*  Paper is paper. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5909.04s)]
*  That they just [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5910.12s)]
*  faded. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5911.04s)]
*  It's new and it's faded. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5913.88s)]
*  It wasn't even like, oh, this is just fade over time. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5917.48s)]
*  No, this started off like, yeah, it is some weird ass picture of them. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5919.8s)]
*  Yeah, with a microphone. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5924.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5925.68s)]
*  Man, you made this at Kinko's. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5926.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5928.12s)]
*  That's that's anonymous with the people who come up in that era. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5930.12s)]
*  Errors are very important when you think about comedy, [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5934.64s)]
*  when you think about anything like I was doing an interview with Vlad [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5940.04s)]
*  and I was talking about [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5944.08s)]
*  Ken Goodson and if you didn't come on this part and went on Vlad, [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5946.24s)]
*  I'd have been so I'd have been like, are you fucking kidding me? [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5950.36s)]
*  No, they do. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5952.48s)]
*  No, that's right. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5953.48s)]
*  I do. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5955.28s)]
*  It was it was pulling teeth. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5956.12s)]
*  It was another [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5958.16s)]
*  it was another day. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5960.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5962.84s)]
*  Yeah, you're not going to get me to incriminate me with old shit. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5964.2s)]
*  And I saw part of it. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5968.8s)]
*  You told a great story. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5970.360000000001s)]
*  Willie D called me to do that. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5971.56s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5973.360000000001s)]
*  Well, it took it took a buffer. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5973.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5976.04s)]
*  Well, he called me and I'm like, hey, man, listen, I know, I know. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5976.76s)]
*  I'm here. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5981.56s)]
*  Oh, correct. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5982.32s)]
*  No, I wouldn't start so I know. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5983.0s)]
*  I know. Yeah. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=5984.88s)]

*  Even if you didn't light it, if you just put it on the table for the energy. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6121.8s)]
*  You just play with your lighter. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6127.96s)]
*  The whole thing. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6129.0s)]

*  And like, I'm not I'm not you have to you have to provoke you. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6144.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6150.52s)]
*  I have to be provoked. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6150.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6151.64s)]
*  Other than that, I'm just fucking happy go lucky. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6151.88s)]
*  I'm living my life. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6154.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6156.08s)]
*  That's what a grenade is, though. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6157.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6158.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6158.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6158.679999999999s)]
*  A grenade is just a baseball. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6158.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6160.32s)]
*  Until somebody takes the pin out. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6160.48s)]
*  You are a grenade, actually. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6162.08s)]
*  Yes. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6164.88s)]
*  Because with the pin in, it is no different than a baseball. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6165.2s)]
*  You throw it around to your friends. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6167.5599999999995s)]
*  Everybody's playing catcher's play. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6168.679999999999s)]
*  The same as the pin goes out. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6170.04s)]
*  It's like, all right, I'll leave it off the fucking pin. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6171.5599999999995s)]
*  Everyone's dead. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6173.32s)]
*  Everyone's dead now. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6174.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6174.92s)]
*  But you know, what's weird is this. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6175.8s)]
*  Like you say, like Thompson girl. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6179.0s)]
*  Yeah, he loved Tom. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6180.88s)]
*  He wouldn't say that. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6181.92s)]
*  Tom's like, he's fucking awesome. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6182.719999999999s)]
*  Like when I'm around, it depends on the people that I'm around. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6185.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6189.56s)]
*  Because sometimes people be extra aggressive for no reason. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6190.320000000001s)]
*  And I just be like. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6193.320000000001s)]
*  Towards you. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6194.120000000001s)]
*  Just in the room. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6195.360000000001s)]
*  Why? [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6196.56s)]
*  Why do you think? [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6196.92s)]
*  I can because sometimes people really have. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6197.56s)]
*  Is there an ego thing? [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6200.84s)]
*  It's like sometimes an insecurity thing. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6201.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6203.4800000000005s)]
*  You don't think this is why I always hated to go do certain shows [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6203.8s)]
*  because I would do shows with Ari. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6209.4800000000005s)]
*  I know what you're talking about. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6211.72s)]
*  And it's like everybody wants everybody to win. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6212.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6215.72s)]
*  But then it's there. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6216.24s)]
*  I'm going to go wreck this. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6217.36s)]
*  It's just all about them. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6218.64s)]
*  And I'm like, you know, man, this is a show for every fucking body. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6220.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6224.68s)]
*  And you can be around Bruce Bruce, Don DC Curry some more. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6225.400000000001s)]
*  And who else is on that show? [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6232.52s)]
*  Lavelle Crawford. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6236.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6238.08s)]
*  Happy as a clam on the show. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6239.32s)]
*  I'm the youngest one. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6242.799999999999s)]
*  I don't have no what they know. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6244.28s)]
*  They're like, yo, when they're going because he's going to go out. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6247.44s)]
*  But they know what it is. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6251.5599999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6253.0s)]
*  But you have me. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6253.28s)]
*  Then you get around some other people. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6254.16s)]
*  And there seems to be like a competitive. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6255.839999999999s)]
*  Like, yeah, why are we competing? [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6258.2s)]
*  I mean, you know this already. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6261.0s)]
*  It's like I think there is an insecurity with folks. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6262.679999999999s)]
*  And like sometimes people, the way that they present their insecurities [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6265.28s)]
*  is kind of debilitating to like building friendships and building any kind of [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6270.0s)]
*  community. Like if somebody thinks that you're funnier than them, there are [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6275.200000000001s)]
*  people who are confident that are like, man, I'm a huge fan of yours, dude. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6279.52s)]
*  I fucking love that. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6282.76s)]
*  Like your your skill doesn't make them feel bad about themselves. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6283.8s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6288.64s)]
*  But then there are some people who are like, I got to find a way to cut him down [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6289.08s)]
*  because I think in my head he's better than me. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6293.4800000000005s)]
*  So I got to convince me he ain't shit. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6295.200000000001s)]
*  And then you feel that animosity. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6298.04s)]
*  And I think that. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6300.28s)]
*  I think that is the worst version of at least our industry, and I know it [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6302.24s)]
*  presents itself in other industries, too, but it's like that's the work. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6305.5599999999995s)]
*  To be honest, like low key, I think this is something that Rogan has helped in [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6310.12s)]
*  comedy because he's so supportive, like he so wants to shine a light on people [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6314.48s)]
*  he thinks are talented that I think it got a lot of comics who are generally [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6319.0s)]
*  kind of bitter and angry to be like, you know, maybe there's a different way that [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6323.8s)]
*  we can do this because there's enough. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6327.88s)]
*  Yeah, there might be enough. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6329.56s)]
*  Like Rogan's mad at me. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6330.8s)]

*  Once you see the industry support, if you'll even care, [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6438.6s)]

*  which is the people. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6448.120000000001s)]

*  They existed with Comedy Central. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6465.96s)]

*  It's like, who the hell is watching Comedy Central at midnight on a Friday or whatever? [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6490.4s)]
*  And then they never showed it again. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6495.24s)]
*  It's like... [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6497.96s)]
*  And something told me this wasn't going to be the thing. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6501.360000000001s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6747.4400000000005s)]
*  It was 2007. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6747.76s)]
*  It's just what you're normally doing. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6748.64s)]
*  So you're like, yeah. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6750.4400000000005s)]

*  So then I said, I'm going to put this YouTube thing out. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6752.8s)]
*  I shot it for YouTube and we had 28 people. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6756.56s)]
*  And then I went to this... [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6763.6s)]
*  My manager hooked me up with this marketing guy and said, hey, man, we got to grow your page. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6765.360000000001s)]

*  Right. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6777.320000000001s)]
*  And Facebook knows it was damn the same as YouTube. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6778.64s)]
*  Like, I couldn't even get into it. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6784.0s)]
*  That's how bad the shit was. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6785.4800000000005s)]
*  I didn't even know how to get into it because I wasn't checking it. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6786.360000000001s)]
*  It was no movement. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6789.52s)]
*  So we started creating the movement with the advice from them. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6794.0s)]
*  I had no... [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6802.400000000001s)]
*  When I saw your... [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6803.76s)]
*  When I heard your whole thing, it was like, it had a deal. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6805.76s)]
*  It didn't have a deal. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6809.280000000001s)]
*  So he put it out on his own. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6810.88s)]
*  And I was like, oh, he on... [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6812.52s)]

*  I ain't going to say I'm on this shit. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6869.24s)]
*  He got all this fucking money. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6870.44s)]
*  He got fired smoking shit. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6871.639999999999s)]
*  But I'm on some broke shit. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6873.639999999999s)]
*  I was like... [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6875.16s)]
*  That was my like fifth thing we put out. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6876.16s)]
*  So like the first one, matter of fact, the first one was super early. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6879.48s)]
*  The second one we did, we were in Europe and this is how broke it was. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6883.24s)]
*  For one of the shoots, we were in London. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6888.599999999999s)]
*  We use a gum to balance the camera. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6891.16s)]
*  Do you remember that? [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6896.0s)]
*  Because we didn't have a tripod. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6897.0s)]
*  We ran out of tripods. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6899.0s)]
*  We could only travel with like two or three tripods. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6900.08s)]
*  So we got two sticks of gum and we put it under one part of the camera. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6902.599999999999s)]
*  And in the wide shot, when people are laughing, you could see the camera shaking. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6906.72s)]
*  And it's not because of the tripods, because the gum wouldn't give us enough suspension [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6910.84s)]
*  or some shit. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6915.72s)]
*  So we went... [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6916.52s)]
*  I mean, it was just... [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6917.68s)]
*  But whatever, I know the journey that you were on. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6919.280000000001s)]
*  And I respect that majorly just because I've experienced it, man. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6922.280000000001s)]
*  And when I started looking into yourself, like, oh, he's getting it like he can. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=6926.400000000001s)]

*  Who is this guy? [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7282.6s)]
*  No matter how great you think his storytelling is, this is how he gets the stories because [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7283.6s)]
*  he just fell off the ladder that he shouldn't have been on. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7291.88s)]
*  Don't after 30 years try to be Mr. Fix-It in the house. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7296.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7298.52s)]
*  You Mr. Fix-It on the road. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7299.52s)]
*  You got to. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7300.52s)]
*  You got to try because it's very intimidating for some other man to come to your house and [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7301.52s)]

*  He said, you going to be mad. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7369.28s)]
*  Then the motherfucker said, I said, what happened? [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7370.28s)]
*  And I didn't like the fact that he did it. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7373.28s)]
*  Is it the? [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7376.28s)]

*  Oh no. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7382.28s)]
*  He did it like three times to show me how it goes. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7383.28s)]
*  He could have pretended to take longer. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7391.28s)]
*  He did. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7392.28s)]

*  Let me tell you, this is the part. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7396.2s)]
*  Remember I told you you going to be mad? [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7398.2s)]
*  This is the part. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7399.2s)]
*  I said, man, how much all you? [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7400.2s)]

*  Don't start with that shit. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7404.2s)]
*  It was like $170. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7406.2s)]
*  What company fucking policy? [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7409.2s)]

*  this finger kind of dips down like that? [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7429.12s)]
*  I was reaching over my car when I was 15 years old to pull the cord, fractured my finger [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7430.639999999999s)]

*  You're in that. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7437.04s)]
*  But you're 15. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7438.04s)]
*  Yeah, you're supposed to fuck up. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7439.04s)]
*  No, I'm 51 years old. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7440.04s)]
*  How to work a garage. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7443.04s)]
*  This is the thing. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7447.04s)]
*  Man, I forgot. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7448.04s)]
*  I don't like 20. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7449.04s)]
*  It's so... [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7450.88s)]
*  Bro, I didn't know how to open the garage from outside. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7452.88s)]
*  My wife doesn't know this. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7456.32s)]
*  For the last month, I've been parking my car, going into my house, coming around to the [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7457.32s)]
*  back door of the garage, walking into the garage, open it from the inside, and then [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7463.2s)]
*  driving the car in. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7467.16s)]
*  And then I was in the kitchen and there's a little bowl and there was this little like [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7468.68s)]
*  almost like remote type of thing. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7474.5199999999995s)]
*  And I was like, babe, what is this? [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7476.32s)]
*  She's like, it's the garage door opener. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7477.32s)]
*  She goes, how you could open the garage? [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7480.32s)]
*  I go, obviously I know how to open the garage. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7482.32s)]
*  So I thought you'd just walk in and then open it. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7488.32s)]
*  No, the worst is that my girl would compare me to her dad. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7490.32s)]
*  Oh, don't do that. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7493.32s)]
*  Her dad was an engineer, so he just fixed everything. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7494.32s)]
*  So our dryer breaks and I go, let me call the guy to fix it. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7496.32s)]
*  She goes, oh, why don't you just fix it? [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7498.32s)]
*  I go, ah, we should just let him do it, right? [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7500.32s)]
*  And she goes, oh, that's so weird. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7502.32s)]
*  My dad would just fix it. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7503.32s)]
*  Nah. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7504.32s)]
*  We'll call him. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7505.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7506.32s)]
*  No, man. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7507.32s)]
*  We're not doing this. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7508.32s)]
*  I have a girl, a wife. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7509.599999999999s)]
*  No, he got a wife and kids. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7512.599999999999s)]
*  So you just call your girl good. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7513.599999999999s)]
*  I can't call mine a lady who lives in my house. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7515.599999999999s)]
*  She refuses to go by that. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7519.599999999999s)]
*  But when I said the shows, that's when everybody comes up [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7521.599999999999s)]
*  and says, hey, this is the lady who lives in my house. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7525.599999999999s)]

*  The lady who lives in my house. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7529.599999999999s)]
*  A roommate maybe. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7534.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7535.88s)]
*  It's weird. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7536.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7538.88s)]
*  It's because you're on the road for so long, [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7539.88s)]
*  you develop a very specific set of skills, right? [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7543.88s)]
*  And they're, thank God, appreciated by a lot of people. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7546.88s)]
*  And we can provide and we can do these things. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7550.88s)]
*  But because of that, we never develop the most basic skills [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7552.88s)]
*  at home. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7556.88s)]
*  I love that. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7557.88s)]
*  So the special is really about you spending a little home time [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7558.88s)]
*  and just being completely unequipped. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7562.88s)]
*  You got to bring up prison. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7565.16s)]
*  You back. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7566.16s)]

*  Like I could start all types of shit. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7573.16s)]
*  I could fix everything that I needed to fix. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7575.16s)]
*  I fixed my ankle. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7577.16s)]
*  I think this is myself. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7582.16s)]
*  But this is man. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7584.16s)]

*  It's always like chronological of your life. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7613.44s)]
*  And so this new special is where you're at now. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7615.44s)]
*  But there's one thing from the second one that I was bawling [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7618.719999999999s)]
*  crying when you tell a story about your younger sister, [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7623.719999999999s)]
*  God bless her dead. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7627.719999999999s)]
*  But like, boy, I've never been laughing hysterically, [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7628.719999999999s)]
*  then bawling crying, and then immediately right back to laughs. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7632.719999999999s)]
*  I've never seen a special that made me do that before. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7636.719999999999s)]
*  How many times have you told that story on stage? [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7638.719999999999s)]
*  Because you're also... [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7640.719999999999s)]
*  Ever. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7641.719999999999s)]
*  That's what I was wondering. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7642.719999999999s)]
*  Because the way he's crying, dog, that's what got me, [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7643.719999999999s)]
*  I'm not crying from the story, but I was like, [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7647.0s)]
*  there's no way you've run this 50 times. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7649.0s)]
*  I didn't run that special period. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7651.0s)]
*  Wow. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7653.0s)]
*  Wow. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7654.0s)]
*  Eric. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7655.0s)]
*  This is part two. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7656.0s)]
*  This is Domino Effect part two. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7657.0s)]
*  Part two. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7659.0s)]
*  So Joe, nobody knew what I was doing. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7660.0s)]
*  I just told them how I wanted it to look. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7665.0s)]
*  And they was like, well, you give us something. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7668.0s)]
*  I'm like, I got it. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7671.0s)]
*  Wow. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7673.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7674.0s)]
*  We did it. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7675.28s)]
*  We recorded it. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7677.28s)]
*  It was no running of that. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7678.28s)]
*  It was no... [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7681.28s)]
*  Did you know you were going to tell that story? [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7682.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7684.28s)]
*  OK, so you knew going into... [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7685.28s)]
*  I knew the years. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7686.28s)]
*  And you mapped it out in your room. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7687.28s)]
*  It was no way to skip... [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7689.28s)]
*  That part. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7691.28s)]
*  That part. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7692.28s)]
*  Right. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7693.28s)]
*  It's like, I knew... [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7694.28s)]
*  Crazy. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7696.28s)]
*  Because he had asked the question, [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7697.28s)]
*  did I know I was going to put it out in that order? [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7699.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7702.28s)]
*  So I did Domino Effect one, and then people asked what was the rest of the story. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7703.28s)]
*  So then I did two. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7708.28s)]
*  So we went from 10, you know what I'm saying, to 16. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7711.28s)]
*  Then we went from 16. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7717.28s)]
*  So we just went in order of the years. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7719.28s)]
*  See, I thought you had this whole thing mapped out, part one to part... [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7722.28s)]
*  So you did part one. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7725.28s)]
*  We didn't have it... [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7727.28s)]
*  We mapped it out after one, after the success of one. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7728.28s)]
*  And people wanted to know the story, so we figured we would just do... [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7731.28s)]
*  After two, I knew I was going to do three and four. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7735.28s)]
*  But it was no... [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7739.28s)]
*  Like, if I tell you... [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7742.28s)]
*  And it's like with me, I don't talk about other people's craft, [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7747.28s)]
*  that's what they're doing. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7751.28s)]
*  But when I watch somebody else try to create that moment, [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7753.28s)]
*  it's like you're discrediting a very honest moment. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7758.28s)]
*  Because I knew... [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7764.28s)]
*  Without running it, I knew as soon as I got to that part, I started feeling it. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7768.28s)]
*  And my older sister is in the audience. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7778.28s)]
*  And this is her first time ever hearing our story. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7782.28s)]
*  My account of what happened, because she had went back to the Navy. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7787.28s)]
*  And I don't think people understand, my little sister is like the heartbeat of me. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7794.28s)]
*  It's like... [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7804.28s)]
*  It's a different... [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7807.28s)]
*  This is like the purest happiness before my kids. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7810.28s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7815.28s)]
*  So she's tattooed on me twice. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7817.28s)]
*  It's a thing when it comes to her. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7821.28s)]
*  So it was no way that I could... [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7826.28s)]
*  Run it over and over. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7830.28s)]
*  It was no way. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7832.28s)]
*  It was like, man, get to it and not know how you was going to come out of it. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7834.28s)]
*  That's what I was going to ask. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7844.28s)]
*  You know you're going to tell it. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7847.28s)]
*  Are you able to stay in the moment with everything that's leading up to it, knowing that this is coming? [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7850.28s)]
*  Get here and then you're going to have to figure it out after you're there. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7857.28s)]
*  Because you may not be able to continue. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7866.28s)]
*  So I don't know what to prepare my head to continue with. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7871.28s)]
*  Because it's so... [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7878.28s)]
*  I think this is the most damaging thing ever in my whole life. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7882.28s)]
*  People talk about the prison, the prison, that's whatever. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7888.28s)]
*  But the reason why I'm there is because she's gone. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7892.28s)]
*  Because this turned me into something different. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7899.28s)]
*  I was a different... [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7902.28s)]
*  I became a different dude. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7906.28s)]
*  I would stop doing whatever I was doing to make sure I went to pick up from school. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7909.28s)]
*  So me picking my daughter up from school, me picking my kids up from school is a big thing because it's still the connection. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7914.28s)]
*  That you have with your little sister. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7921.28s)]
*  So it's like a punishing thing. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7923.28s)]
*  And so I still ask her for help when I'm in positions. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7929.28s)]
*  And she was only eight. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7937.28s)]
*  And I was like, yo, man, you're going to have to walk me through this. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7939.28s)]
*  And that's... [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7944.28s)]
*  It's punishing when you lose your happiness like that. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7946.28s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7953.28s)]
*  So to do the set, as I'm thinking about it, I am on stage and I'm like, damn. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7954.28s)]
*  How and what can I actually even say that's going to turn this around? [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7968.28s)]
*  And I'm looking at my sister, right? [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7979.28s)]
*  And my sister is just bawling in the audience. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7982.28s)]
*  And then one of my boys, street dude, he is on one. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7987.28s)]
*  And I see him looking, he looking off. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7993.28s)]
*  He can't even look at his wife. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7995.28s)]
*  He's looking off because he's bawling and he knows the situation. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=7997.28s)]
*  He was around. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8002.28s)]
*  And it pops into my head out of nowhere. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8005.28s)]
*  Because I was asking him, yo, you're going to have to help me through this, shorty. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8010.28s)]
*  And then Pops came to my head. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8015.28s)]
*  This dude who used to sell dope for us. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8018.28s)]
*  During that time, the only person that could make me laugh was Pops. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8021.28s)]
*  Because I would come to the cookhouse and he would be in his Speedos cooking drugs. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8027.28s)]
*  And I was like, yo, man, this dude is insane. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8032.28s)]
*  He's insane, man. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8038.28s)]
*  And Pops was sick. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8042.28s)]
*  And he had on Speedos. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8044.28s)]
*  I'm like, yo, man, what you got going on? [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8046.28s)]
*  Don't worry about what the chef got on. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8048.28s)]
*  I'm like, yo, man, this is a crazy person. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8052.28s)]
*  So that helped me to remember that moment. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8054.28s)]
*  And I was digging in my head, like, what made you laugh at this time? [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8061.28s)]
*  And it was only Pops. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8068.28s)]
*  And you thought of that during the taping? [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8070.28s)]
*  During the taping. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8071.28s)]
*  Wow. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8072.28s)]
*  Because after the thing, you're crying, it's like beautiful. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8073.28s)]
*  Then afterward, you talk about the anger, which most people don't talk about. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8076.28s)]
*  Most people don't think about when they think about loss. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8081.28s)]
*  And I remember you said it with this fury. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8083.28s)]
*  I was like, there's no way he's ever said this before. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8085.28s)]
*  It turned me into a fucking monster. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8087.28s)]
*  I will fucking kill you. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8089.28s)]
*  If you say what's up to me, I'll fucking end the feeling. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8091.28s)]
*  What's up will get you killed. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8094.28s)]
*  And I was like, there's no way he said this. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8096.28s)]
*  There's no way he's run this a hundred times. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8099.28s)]
*  It's just not possible. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8101.28s)]
*  I only cry because I have regret of time that I didn't spend. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8102.28s)]
*  With her, yeah. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8108.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8110.28s)]
*  That I could have been doing, but I'm out doing other bullshit. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8111.28s)]
*  Okay, you going to pick up from school, you spending time with her. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8114.28s)]
*  But you could have did more that probably wouldn't have. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8117.28s)]
*  And it wasn't even my thought pattern at the time. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8122.28s)]
*  Right. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8129.28s)]
*  But how much you love this little girl and the moments that you did. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8130.28s)]
*  Like I can't look at Ashley furniture truck and not think about her. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8139.28s)]
*  Right. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8144.28s)]
*  Because I'll never forget the time we walking home and she let my hand go and start running. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8145.28s)]
*  I'm like, what you doing? [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8150.28s)]
*  She said, you got to come on. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8151.28s)]
*  I got to catch this man. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8153.28s)]
*  He got my truck. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8154.28s)]
*  Because it said her name on the side. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8155.28s)]
*  And when she dressed up like Halloween, she had on all black and she had her face paint like a cat. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8158.28s)]
*  And I was like, what you got going on? [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8165.28s)]
*  She's like, meh, meh. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8167.28s)]
*  And it's like all of these things. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8168.28s)]
*  And when she passed, I was sitting in her room and I would hear her in the closet playing like she normally would be doing. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8170.28s)]
*  And I know how devastating this was for my family. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8181.28s)]
*  It's like crippled my mom. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8185.28s)]
*  Because this was, and then I learned why crippled my mom. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8188.28s)]
*  This was the first time that my mom was in a comfortable position that she could actually raise. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8193.279999999999s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8200.279999999999s)]
*  So she took care of us. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8204.279999999999s)]
*  But she raised her. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8207.279999999999s)]
*  And so this is me understanding why this was my mom asked me all the time, hey, was I a good mom? [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8211.28s)]
*  You know, you know I love you, right? [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8220.28s)]
*  And it's because this is the effects of her not completing the job. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8223.28s)]
*  She's never got a chance to comfortably raise a child. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8229.28s)]
*  You know, it was, you know, me and my sister, she had us early. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8235.28s)]
*  You know, my mom had me, she's 20 years old. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8239.28s)]
*  And my sister's two years older than me. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8242.28s)]
*  So she just going through life just taking care of us. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8245.28s)]
*  But now she's in our, she's established and she's for eight years, she's raising. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8249.28s)]
*  She's leaning in. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8255.28s)]
*  She's all in. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8256.28s)]
*  She's getting everything that she, she's going to do everything that she never got a chance to do. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8257.28s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8262.28s)]
*  So that's an angle. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8263.28s)]
*  And then for family members never to have seen her living. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8267.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8273.28s)]
*  Because she lived out of town and they, they were always planning to come and never got a chance. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8274.28s)]
*  And the first time my grandmother is seeing her grandchild in a box. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8279.28s)]
*  What is it? [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8285.28s)]
*  What is it you think about? [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8287.28s)]
*  And I'm reacting to your concern about I'm sure there are some reactions that people were like, oh, is this put on for multiple shows or whatever? [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8290.28s)]
*  What is it about you think maybe it's even comedians like our contemporaries that why do you think they felt the need to try to discredit that moment? [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8303.28s)]
*  I really tried not to make sense out of nonsense. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8316.28s)]
*  I had no idea. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8319.28s)]
*  Because maybe it was a this is not something I could have did or whatever the situation may have been. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8323.28s)]
*  I think you're onto something right now. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8330.28s)]
*  But I know the theory that I might say something to me on the Internet. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8332.28s)]
*  In the rage that I responded with speaking about my sister. [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8343.28s)]
*  What they said. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8351.28s)]
*  Some weird shit that I don't even really remember. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8355.28s)]
*  I was so mad like like it was a fake thing or some shit. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8359.28s)]
*  And I and I said, I remember I just remember what I said. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8365.28s)]
*  I promise you on everything that I'm 100 down and I'm going to break your fucking neck backwards. [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8372.28s)]
*  Because you speaking by your your speaking on. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8384.28s)]
*  I remember a dude. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8393.28s)]
*  I'm beating him in basketball in prison. [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8395.28s)]
*  And he said something about. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8399.28s)]
*  I don't worry about it. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8404.28s)]
*  I'm going to do something. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8405.28s)]
*  Whatever he said like that bitch that's tattooed on your chest. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8407.28s)]
*  Does he know? [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8410.28s)]
*  Is he aware at the time? [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8411.28s)]
*  You got a pretty good idea. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8412.28s)]
*  But he doesn't know the story. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8414.28s)]
*  He doesn't know his muscle. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8416.28s)]
*  He don't know nothing. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8417.28s)]
*  And I never forget this brother named Black Show. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8419.28s)]
*  The look that he gave. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8423.28s)]
*  That he knew when I threw the basketball hit him in the face. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8427.28s)]
*  And this is the first time they they'd ever see me come glue come loose. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8432.28s)]
*  Ever. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8438.28s)]
*  And then I had to I had to get talked to. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8441.28s)]
*  He said, bro, people not going to know. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8447.28s)]
*  Yeah, they just talk. [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8450.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8451.28s)]
*  And that dude was was severely injured. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8454.28s)]
*  And I and I'm like, and every time I saw him. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8460.28s)]
*  I just I only felt. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8465.28s)]
*  Yeah, you could. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8468.28s)]
*  I couldn't detach it. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8469.28s)]
*  I couldn't detach from the situation. [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8470.28s)]
*  And I know now it's people that are troll you. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8475.28s)]
*  Of course, to try to try to get a response out of you to make you do it. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8478.28s)]
*  And I've probably gotten it under control now. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8483.28s)]
*  But. To. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8487.28s)]
*  With with with with that particular special, the criticism of people. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8495.28s)]
*  I think it was manufactured. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8503.28s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's people's. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8505.28s)]
*  I think there's a distrust a lot of times when it comes to entertainment. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8509.28s)]
*  And it's this idea that it's like this thing that's workshopped and put on. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8514.28s)]
*  And they're they're feeling these very real emotions. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8519.28s)]
*  And they don't know how to handle those real emotions. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8525.28s)]
*  They either have to accept that they themselves are also touched by this moment, enraged by this moment, broken by this moment, or. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8528.28s)]
*  They don't accept those feelings and they go, ah, this isn't real. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8537.28s)]
*  This person is not putting it on. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8541.28s)]
*  And I think it's an inability to accept that that that moment is maybe punishing them as well. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8543.28s)]
*  And especially if you're a comic of. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8550.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Where you're cynical. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8552.28s)]
*  You're also watching. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8554.28s)]
*  You have to belittle everything that is like beautiful or successful. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8555.28s)]
*  Because you're watching. I'm watching that moment. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8558.28s)]
*  And in my honest reaction, I didn't. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8560.28s)]
*  All of them hit me up and they're like, dude, I'm bawling. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8561.28s)]
*  I'm bawling watching this thing. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8565.28s)]
*  Now, what I would say about us specific, I think it's like a cultural thing on the pod, which is like there is a celebration for things that are great. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8567.28s)]
*  We try to reduce cynicism and it's hard. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8576.28s)]
*  But like, if there is something that is beautiful, the knee jerk reaction shouldn't be to undercut it. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8579.28s)]
*  Because I was watching like, I don't know if I could get this reaction out of an audience. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8586.28s)]
*  I don't know if I have that level of, thank God, pain or what rage or whatever. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8591.28s)]
*  And I don't know if I'd have the balls to do that. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8595.28s)]
*  And I'm watching thinking this must be the first time he's done it. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8597.28s)]
*  So that is a reaction I had. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8600.28s)]
*  But you got to try to fight against that party that wants to discredit and be like, hey, I have a different purpose from God, whatever, on when I'm on that stage. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8602.28s)]
*  But that moment I do remember being like, and that's why I was I was like, you guys did fuck. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8609.28s)]
*  This is fuck. I've never felt this watching anything. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8613.28s)]
*  I've never felt this. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8616.28s)]
*  And I don't know if I could elicit that reaction. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8617.28s)]
*  But a lot of people, instead of just accepting that and saying I have a different purpose or I'll do it differently or whatever, will be like, you know, I'm going to do it differently. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8619.28s)]
*  And whoever will be like, yeah, but he X, Y, Z. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8624.28s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8626.28s)]
*  That's where it comes from. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8627.28s)]
*  And I think the people that was there, if people listen to the audience, it's people crying. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8629.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8640.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8641.28s)]
*  What was the feeling like coming off stage? [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8642.28s)]
*  Was that was it cathartic? [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8644.28s)]
*  I was out when I came off. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8645.28s)]
*  I was met by my my sister. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8647.28s)]
*  I just went into my sister's arms when when when it was over, I wish they had because it was such a the the camera people. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8650.28s)]
*  Eric was like, yeah, I'm glad you didn't send. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8663.28s)]
*  I'm glad you didn't do anything with this. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8670.28s)]
*  It was no way that we could have knowing going into this. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8673.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8678.28s)]
*  This would have been very hard. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8679.28s)]
*  And to I think it was a bigger purpose for me to do it. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8681.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8693.28s)]
*  Then I needed some relief from it. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8694.28s)]
*  I know how many in the fact that I'm going through losses and people are going through losses and from the losing the girl to how many how unprepared we are for losing anybody. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8698.28s)]
*  And you say a thing early in the part two, which is like when people talk about this game, drug dealing or whatever, they never talk about the losses. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8718.28s)]
*  They never talk about the losses. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8724.28s)]
*  I'm going to tell you about what is going on in a person's life that's going through this. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8726.28s)]
*  It's a lot of Ales in this. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8734.28s)]
*  What's what I think is like profound about these moments and you rarely see them a stand up, but it's like it's not just about your loss. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8737.28s)]
*  There are countless people who have had losses that don't always get to process their emotions in the same way. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8745.28s)]
*  And they're processing their losses while they're watching it. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8754.28s)]
*  The people that know you are thinking about your sister, the people that don't know you thinking about the people. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8759.28s)]
*  And like in my last special, I have like a moment that is it's my wife and I was really tough for us to get pregnant. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8766.28s)]
*  It was like like very tough and we were able to do it. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8774.28s)]
*  And I didn't know at the moment when I'm writing the special that people struggled with this shit. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8779.28s)]
*  I had no fucking clue. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8783.28s)]
*  And when we were starting to go on the road like and there's this montage of like my wife getting to see our daughter for the first time. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8784.28s)]
*  And like you go to see these people in the crowd. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8791.28s)]
*  And at first I was like, oh, that's beautiful that they're reacting to my story. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8794.28s)]
*  And then I started to realize they're reacting to their story. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8797.28s)]
*  They're reacting to like their trials and tribulations, the joy that they have with their kid, the struggles they've had trying to get it. [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8800.28s)]
*  And it's like, I wonder if that moment, despite some fucking cynical idiots criticism, I wonder if that moment creates this deep connection with the people that are watching that special. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8807.28s)]
*  Like deep connection where people start to process those feelings that they probably kept bottled up for a long time. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8820.28s)]
*  And also to see a dude you might not call yourself tough, but like a tougher dude break down like that. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8828.28s)]
*  Imagine what that gives you. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8833.28s)]
*  Imagine as a consumer. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8835.28s)]
*  Imagine what that gives you the freedom to all right. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8837.28s)]
*  Maybe I'm allowed to process this shit and feel this shit a little bit. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8839.28s)]
*  You know, I didn't speak about like our funeral because my dad, right? [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8842.28s)]
*  My mom, my dad, been separated for a long time and inside the funeral, all these people in there. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8850.28s)]
*  But when I walk out, my dad is like in the corner of the parking lot, black leather coat, and he's standing there. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8861.28s)]
*  And he's just crying. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8875.28s)]
*  Had nothing to do with this. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8880.28s)]
*  But he under for some reason, he wanted to be there for the we talking about somebody who's not there for most shit. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8883.28s)]
*  And he just like and I never forget looking at his daughter was no. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8893.28s)]
*  OK, OK, OK. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8899.28s)]
*  He's totally out of the business. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8900.28s)]
*  But he was standing there like, yeah, this is tough, bro. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8904.28s)]
*  And he's always been the my mom, my mom is tough as rusty nails. [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8909.28s)]
*  My dad has always been the unflappable. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8917.28s)]
*  And like, yeah, I'm just here. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8922.28s)]
*  I'm I'm I'm know what a moment is. [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8925.28s)]
*  And I'm if you need me, I'm here. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8927.28s)]
*  My mom is trying to keep it together, but she is. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8931.28s)]
*  It's like my mom's father. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8937.28s)]
*  And I never really until I realized why it's like this. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8941.28s)]

*  It's. I don't even like leading her down the road, so I never even mentioned Domino effect to her. [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8981.28s)]
*  Wow. Never mentioned. [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=8988.28s)]

*  I don't need to tell you these stories. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9009.28s)]
*  She would have to call me and say, hey, I saw the special, but I'm not bringing it up. [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9010.28s)]
*  Because you don't want her to have to live through that pain. [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9016.28s)]

*  You get mad at the restaurant. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9043.28s)]
*  Why the fuck you put this ketchup on it? [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9045.28s)]
*  Because once you spill something on your shirt, you just look fat. [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9048.28s)]
*  It's over. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9051.28s)]

*  What a gift. [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9065.28s)]
*  You were talking about some real painful shit and then right into the funny and you're just [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9066.28s)]

*  I was hoping it was just some of the moisture on his eyes. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9089.28s)]
*  I was like, it's just water. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9092.28s)]
*  It's not. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9095.28s)]
*  It's a goddamn comic. [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9096.28s)]
*  But as a comic, I think that's your, that's the craft. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9100.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9107.28s)]
*  Not the job. [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9108.28s)]
*  That's the craft. [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9109.28s)]
*  If you look at this as a job, I wouldn't show up. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9110.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9115.28s)]
*  I wouldn't show up to this shit as a job. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9116.28s)]
*  As soon as I start feeling like it's a job, I take off. [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9119.28s)]
*  I'm getting ready to go to Greece just so I can wear some Speedos and think I'm sexy. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9123.28s)]
*  All them fat bastards over there just wearing Speedos. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9130.28s)]
*  And I'm going to do it, too. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9134.28s)]
*  It's just the experience, man. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9137.28s)]
*  When I stand up, what I said, I said to stand up one time, this old dude said, no, you'll [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9140.28s)]
*  fucking sit down. [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9148.28s)]
*  You don't do shit but sit down and talk. [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9149.28s)]
*  I'm like, you right. [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9152.28s)]
*  But I think that's the part that you have to be brave. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9155.28s)]
*  Everything that we say when you actually in the craft is brave. [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9160.28s)]
*  You know, you speaking about you and your wife trying to concede. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9167.28s)]
*  When you said when she first got a chance to sit, she was in a NICU. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9171.28s)]
*  It was a C-section. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9175.28s)]
*  So there's this big curtain up so you don't actually get to see the baby pulled out of [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9177.28s)]
*  you and you're numb. [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9182.28s)]

*  No, it wasn't pre-me. [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9187.28s)]
*  It was to term. [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9188.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9189.28s)]
*  Ed, as soon as you said it, it took me to the moment to where I didn't get a chance [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9190.28s)]
*  to really connect with Hanan because she was in a NICU for two weeks. [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9195.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9202.28s)]
*  And they just put her like in this incubator and she just flapping around. [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9203.28s)]
*  And you got to put on all this stuff to go see him and it's no real connection. [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9207.28s)]
*  And I couldn't wait to be able to touch. [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9213.28s)]
*  Just hold him. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9219.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9220.28s)]
*  Hanan. [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9221.28s)]
*  And Hanan is like the manager of all the kids. [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9222.28s)]
*  Like even though she young, she's nine, but she's the manager. [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9232.28s)]
*  Hanan is who I talk to about finances. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9237.28s)]
*  Hanan knows where all my money is. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9240.28s)]
*  She don't have to be the one giving them, no, no, no. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9245.28s)]
*  Dig up the begonias. [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9247.28s)]
*  Yeah, Hanan, man, that's my girl. [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9249.28s)]
*  And she reminds me of my sister so much. [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9256.28s)]
*  This is who I talk to. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9262.28s)]
*  So now imagine this. [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9265.28s)]
*  Imagine having a fear of losing your kid. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9270.28s)]
*  Like I'm not really comfortable until they pass eight. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9278.28s)]
*  Dude. [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9283.28s)]
*  Wow. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9284.28s)]
*  I was going to ask. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9285.28s)]
*  I have this whole thing. [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9286.28s)]
*  Until they pass eight, it's like I'm on pins and needles. [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9289.28s)]
*  Hold your breath. [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9294.28s)]
*  Hold your breath. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9295.28s)]
*  Like please don't let nothing happen to them like any of them. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9296.28s)]
*  And I remember Jayden. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9304.28s)]
*  Jayden is a chef. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9306.28s)]
*  She's a wonderful chef. [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9307.28s)]
*  I was so scared. [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9312.28s)]
*  Bro. [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9315.28s)]
*  I remember this whole tumultuous journey to get to this moment and everything that could have gone wrong. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9318.28s)]
*  Went wrong up to this moment and we're in there and my wife's not dilating and she's all up on the pitocin and all these things. [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9324.28s)]
*  She's still not dilating. [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9333.28s)]
*  And there's a moment where the baby's heart rate dropped on the monitor. [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9335.28s)]
*  And keep in mind, like I have not the same level of concern, but you're still like something's going to go wrong because everything has gone wrong on this process. [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9341.28s)]
*  Every single thing is going wrong. [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9349.28s)]
*  And I start to see this monitor drop and then comes back up in the monitor. [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9351.28s)]
*  And then the monitors drop and it's beeping for a while. [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9354.28s)]
*  And I'm like running in the hallway looking for a nurse because in my head, I'm like, it can't go right. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9356.28s)]
*  I haven't felt anything go right. [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9361.28s)]
*  So why would anything go right? [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9362.28s)]
*  And you think like once you see the baby that everything's going to be OK, but the fear doesn't go away. [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9364.28s)]
*  You're like they're like, OK, we need a test to make sure that she can can see and hear. [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9372.28s)]
*  You know, they do that. And you're like, OK, now is the moment. [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9377.28s)]
*  And I literally felt maybe until she was like walking and running. [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9380.28s)]
*  That was the first time I felt like I could take a deep breath. [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9385.28s)]
*  So I can't even imagine what that's like for eight years, just looking at each one of your kids and just going, please, like, when can I relax? [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9390.28s)]
*  Yeah, and it's. [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9401.28s)]
*  It didn't get grown and you hope you don't get a call. [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9404.28s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9409.28s)]
*  Like James 26 and I'm concerned about every day. [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9410.28s)]
*  So it just doesn't go away. [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9420.28s)]
*  It just we're just stressed until I've heard the fear doesn't go away. [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9421.28s)]
*  The fears just change. [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9424.28s)]
*  I don't even know if it changes or it goes away. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9426.28s)]
*  You just. [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9429.28s)]
*  Pray all the time, that just you can manage it. [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9431.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9436.28s)]
*  nothing and that you don't have to manage something. [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9437.28s)]
*  I'm going to manage this fear. [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9441.400000000001s)]
*  So I don't hope that I don't have to manage grief. [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9442.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9446.52s)]
*  You have a choice. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9447.28s)]
*  It's one or the other. [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9448.720000000001s)]
*  You have a choice. [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9449.800000000001s)]
*  And then the days that you miss or they argue or something that you miss with them, [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9450.880000000001s)]
*  you're like, yo, man, this time is precious and I'd rather fix it [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9456.24s)]

*  Or you just want to fuss? [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9465.0s)]
*  Do you think? [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9466.52s)]
*  Do you think that you've invested? [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9468.640000000001s)]
*  I don't want to say more time, but do you think because of that horrible [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9471.880000000001s)]

*  in a different way? Yes. [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9479.12s)]
*  And not just kids, people just. [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=9480.640000000001s)]

*  Jay Prince, I ain't really. [[02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10153.24s)]

*  Can you explain to people maybe from New York, like what Jay is to Houston? [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10159.44s)]
*  Um, [[02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10165.84s)]
*  shit, [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10168.08s)]
*  Jay Prince is the mogul. [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10169.52s)]
*  Like we watch him come up. [[02:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10172.48s)]
*  You know, he's one of the first independent rap labels. [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10175.04s)]
*  That's why our city is so independent. [[02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10178.6s)]
*  We've never been looking for deals due to the prototype of what Jay and other guys [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10181.24s)]
*  cultivated. [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10189.880000000001s)]
*  So when you [[02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10190.92s)]
*  I don't even know what he is just to Houston, but it's just to the whole hip hop [[02:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10194.039999999999s)]
*  industry, he was he was really different from Puffy and Shug and and and everybody [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10198.279999999999s)]
*  else because he was the format, he was the formula when there was no formula. [[02:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10205.64s)]
*  So how else can we get on? [[02:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10211.039999999999s)]
*  How else can we create music and be part of this industry, which seems to have [[02:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10212.72s)]
*  a lot of gatekeeping? [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10217.56s)]
*  And he was like, well, we'll just create our own version of it, [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10219.119999999999s)]
*  which is why Houston has this flourishing hip hop scene that's not reliant on any [[02:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10222.4s)]
*  major record label. There's all these independent hip hop musicians in Houston [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10228.52s)]
*  and it's influenced music in general without this like label push. [[02:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10232.52s)]
*  I must say this with gusto. [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10239.84s)]
*  Our artists laugh [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10242.119999999999s)]
*  at other artists because in our mind, you're not living better than us. [[02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10245.76s)]
*  You're not making more money because you're getting 80 percent of your of your [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10251.68s)]
*  album sales in Houston. [[02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10255.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10257.039999999999s)]
*  Role. [[02:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10258.56s)]
*  This is this is all of you who I know that own multiple roles. [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10259.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's dude. [[02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10265.0s)]
*  It's so [[02:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10266.279999999999s)]
*  I think it is important that people understand this. [[02:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10268.88s)]
*  It's like, I like Slim, Slim, Slim was like building up neighborhoods. [[02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10270.8s)]
*  You remember this? [[02:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10276.439999999999s)]
*  Like he was riding around like a neighborhood that he built, not just like [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10277.4s)]
*  like he owned a condo, the neighborhood. [[02:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10280.0s)]
*  So we we do this all the time. [[02:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10282.12s)]
*  So what people get when Mike Epps built some houses, they're like, oh, you know, [[02:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10284.28s)]
*  we like that's old. [[02:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10288.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10290.32s)]
*  But shout out to Epps, you know, that is cool that he brought back the album. [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10291.52s)]
*  And that's cool. [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10295.08s)]
*  We've been doing it. [[02:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10296.12s)]
*  Right. And I think because you're doing it on your own, it's like [[02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10297.56s)]
*  it doesn't permeate industry standard. [[02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10302.68s)]
*  And I think it's because industry doesn't want people to know that it can be done [[02:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10305.48s)]
*  on its own. Why would they promote it? [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10309.72s)]
*  Just look at it. [[02:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10312.08s)]

*  percentages of their catalog, they're making. [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10408.52s)]
*  Man, fat fat, [[02:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10412.08s)]
*  hot before he passed, waltzness. [[02:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10414.36s)]
*  Oh, man, [[02:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10417.88s)]
*  K Reno, I can name multiple rappers who just good like they like, man, we good. [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10420.24s)]
*  Right. Like it is a profession there where it feels like outside of. [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10426.359999999999s)]
*  And it's not just Houston. [[02:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10431.72s)]
*  I think that, like, there are other areas that has popped up as well. [[02:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10432.8s)]
*  But it doesn't seem like there's the most wealth that has been concentrated [[02:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10436.119999999999s)]
*  in that like area of independent artists, at least. [[02:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10439.48s)]
*  But. [[02:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10442.359999999999s)]
*  OK, so here's a question. [[02:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10444.279999999999s)]
*  Drake has had this like perceived connectivity to Houston, [[02:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10446.560000000001s)]
*  and I think it's because of that's because of the jazz, because the jazz is his son. [[02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10450.52s)]
*  A prince. Yeah. [[02:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10455.400000000001s)]
*  And he seems to really like lean into Houston and have this. [[02:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10456.720000000001s)]
*  It seems genuine. Again, I'm an outsider. [[02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10461.28s)]
*  I don't know this appreciation of Houston. [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10463.2s)]
*  Is that a business deal or is that like a real connection and affinity to those [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10465.400000000001s)]
*  artists like does Houston really embrace and welcome Drake in that way? [[02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10470.24s)]
*  And you don't have to give me like a fucking hot take or this. [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10475.6s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10478.32s)]
*  I'm just trying to ask from outside. [[02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10479.6s)]
*  I don't know [[02:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10482.359999999999s)]
*  what his real relationship is because I'm not a part of it. [[02:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10484.44s)]
*  I know what my real relationship is with them. [[02:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10489.96s)]

*  Kiki was trying to go find some look, Kiki. [[02:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10512.76s)]
*  And we saw each other. My son was right there. [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10515.519999999999s)]

*  When we like Roe, we and Roe, our relationship is different than the Roe Roe. [[02:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10595.519999999999s)]
*  Yeah, zero. OK, OK. [[02:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10602.839999999998s)]

*  OK, you get your pass. Thank you. [[02:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10610.24s)]
*  White privilege. [[02:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10613.72s)]
*  No. So a lot of our artists, man, [[02:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10616.0s)]
*  they just in their own bubble a lot of times when it comes to outside industry. [[02:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10620.56s)]
*  So when Drake thing, [[02:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10626.48s)]
*  I know that he was getting embraced because of affiliation. [[02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10629.199999999999s)]
*  Right. Not earned. [[02:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10632.84s)]
*  Not earned, you know, nothing really earned. [[02:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10636.16s)]
*  So but you can go to any other city and do that same thing by affiliation. [[02:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10640.08s)]
*  Right. But you got people like Luda. [[02:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10644.76s)]
*  That they actually have a real affection. [[02:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10649.28s)]
*  Oh, really? You know, even the looters from Atlanta. [[02:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10652.12s)]
*  Yeah, but he's just embracing love than Houston. [[02:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10654.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he's embraced because he put time in there, you know, with certain artists. [[02:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10657.64s)]
*  Everybody when you get embraced, you got to be like, I'm going to tell you, [[02:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10665.52s)]
*  we embrace J.J. [[02:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10669.480000000001s)]
*  not jazz, for people who fucking love jazz. [[02:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10670.640000000001s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? That's that's a real thing. [[02:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10675.2s)]
*  Without with our R&B artists, you know, [[02:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10678.12s)]
*  we have a lot of different genres for music. [[02:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10682.28s)]
*  Most people don't even know Travis Scott from Houston. [[02:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10685.4s)]
*  I think that he's reached such superstardom [[02:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10688.36s)]
*  that he's just known as like American musician. [[02:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10691.44s)]
*  But you guys are like, no, this is Houston. [[02:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10694.76s)]
*  Because we get discredited for the artists that we do put out. [[02:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10697.36s)]
*  That's the second they leave. [[02:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10701.640000000001s)]
*  It's like we know that Beyonce is from Houston, but I don't know if she's thought [[02:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10703.240000000002s)]
*  of as Houston, but that's crazy because she definitely represents Houston. [[02:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10709.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's interesting. [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10715.400000000001s)]
*  She's so Houston. [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10716.640000000001s)]
*  You lose your identity as being from Houston, the more popular you get, [[02:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10717.720000000001s)]
*  even if you don't want that, like the rest of the world takes you on. [[02:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10723.12s)]
*  Ask your question, is Jay-Z embraced? [[02:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10726.76s)]
*  In New York like that, of course, I mean, yeah, this is, of course, [[02:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10730.72s)]
*  or is it just by industry people or they people? [[02:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10734.24s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, I would even go so far as to loved. [[02:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10736.4s)]
*  I don't even know if I don't even know [[02:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10740.0s)]
*  if Jay's embraced outside of New York, I would say that that's kind of a hot take. [[02:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10743.039999999999s)]
*  But like where we put him, like, I don't know if they pretend he had no idea [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10746.88s)]
*  about Diddy, it's like really crazy. [[02:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10752.039999999999s)]
*  They're like there's no way he knew. [[02:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10754.56s)]
*  And it's like, well, that's weird. [[02:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10755.92s)]
*  Like in our minds, he's a stadium act in all countries around the world. [[02:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10757.16s)]
*  I don't know if if he is that, but in our minds he is. [[02:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10762.64s)]
*  Is that fair to say? [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10767.16s)]
*  I'm talking about away from the act. [[02:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10768.52s)]
*  I'm talking about beloved. [[02:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10770.24s)]
*  He is. [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10771.92s)]
*  It's it's good in any hood. [[02:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10773.52s)]
*  He can walk around. [[02:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10776.48s)]
*  Like for us, like, no, I don't think I really understand what I'm talking about. [[02:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10777.92s)]
*  Oh, what do you think? [[02:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10782.24s)]
*  I'm talking about Muhammad Ali embraced with no fucking security, with no none of [[02:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10782.76s)]
*  that shit, you just what you just outside. [[02:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10787.48s)]
*  Like I'm outside. [[02:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10790.28s)]
*  He doesn't do that. [[02:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10791.6s)]
*  But he could. But he can't. [[02:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10792.800000000001s)]
*  I think he's got that much in New York. [[02:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10794.36s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[02:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10796.12s)]
*  OK, as an outsider, the way they love him is like, yeah, yeah. [[02:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10797.2s)]
*  I think for us, it's like I'm a Texas kid. [[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10800.880000000001s)]
*  Jay-Z is is like so there's two different things. [[03:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10803.36s)]
*  It's like. [[03:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10806.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10808.4s)]

*  but it's like who do I want to hang out and kick it with? [[03:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10810.64s)]
*  As far as like New York goes, rappers goes, it's like 50. [[03:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10813.439999999999s)]
*  I want to just if I'm going to party, if I'm going to hang out and watch it, [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10816.72s)]
*  I just want 50 is just going to make everything hilarious. [[03:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10820.32s)]
*  And he's going to say wild jokes is going to be he's the goat. [[03:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10823.519999999999s)]
*  Right. [[03:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10827.279999999999s)]
*  And then there's Jay-Z who is like, oh, this is the the businessman tycoon. [[03:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10828.32s)]
*  So I think that there's a lot of inspiration, which is almost like unfair [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10835.56s)]
*  for 50 in terms of like what he's achieved in his career as well. [[03:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10838.36s)]
*  Like, but I think you look at these two people and despite obviously some, [[03:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10841.56s)]
*  you know, rough stuff that's going on in hip hop or at least in like gang life, [[03:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10847.36s)]
*  50 said he could go wherever the fuck he wants. [[03:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10852.76s)]
*  Jay-Z could go wherever the fuck he wants. [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10854.6s)]
*  And they're just Mount Rushmore in New York City. [[03:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10856.199999999999s)]
*  There's two. There's not four. [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10859.68s)]
*  There's two. [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10861.119999999999s)]
*  And which is which is crazy because you rest in peace. [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10862.0s)]
*  I'm talking about alive. [[03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10865.48s)]
*  Y'all y'all put these y'all put those two rappers on Mount Rushmore and forget [[03:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10866.48s)]
*  about all the rest of them. [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10873.92s)]
*  Nobody is above Rakim. [[03:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10876.039999999999s)]
*  Not neither one. [[03:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10879.0s)]
*  You're talking about a generational thing right now. [[03:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10879.8s)]
*  And I think that like older heads will look at a Rakim and they'll be like, [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10881.84s)]
*  this is the greatest rapper we produce. [[03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10885.84s)]
*  I think the younger people don't they're not as familiar with a Rakim. [[03:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10889.199999999999s)]
*  And also another thing with New York. [[03:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10893.64s)]
*  Yeah, something that's different from New York compared to Houston, it sounds like [[03:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10895.880000000001s)]
*  we have the crabs in the barrel mentality, like it could only be one. [[03:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10900.32s)]
*  You choose your guy and now you got to go hard for your guy instead of just [[03:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10904.08s)]
*  embracing everybody and loving everybody. [[03:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10907.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10909.0s)]
*  And they even respect heavy D and I'll be like, yo, y'all losing your goddamn mind. [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10909.72s)]
*  But again, [[03:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10914.16s)]
*  but this is like this is like dumb generational shit where it's like [[03:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10915.48s)]
*  I think that does. [[03:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10919.32s)]
*  Bill Russell type shit is competitive nature. [[03:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10920.28s)]
*  Same Bill Russell. [[03:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10922.72s)]
*  We have to choose between Nas. [[03:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10924.519999999999s)]
*  Big Daddy Kane. [[03:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10927.32s)]
*  Nas is going to get disrespected by the young generation. [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10929.4s)]
*  The whole thing is just because you didn't see it doesn't mean that it didn't set [[03:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10931.88s)]
*  the foundation for what you're doing now. [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10935.64s)]
*  Truth. [[03:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10938.92s)]
*  But they don't know. [[03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10939.88s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10941.199999999999s)]
*  You know why they don't know? [[03:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10942.76s)]
*  Because y'all are not teaching them. [[03:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10943.8s)]
*  Y'all just going with the frame. [[03:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10947.84s)]
*  No, Charlamagne says this exact same shit. [[03:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10949.359999999999s)]
*  He's like, we're not celebrating the people who have laid the foundation. [[03:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10951.12s)]
*  We're not celebrating the OGs enough. [[03:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10954.8s)]
*  There's this like immediate reaction to like what is hot and new now instead of [[03:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10956.8s)]
*  embracing the legends, music in particular, is so youth driven, [[03:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10961.08s)]
*  whereas it does feel like in Houston, there's still an embracing of the legends. [[03:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10964.32s)]
*  But I also think they keep putting out music. [[03:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10968.96s)]
*  It's like these guys, they're not taking time off. [[03:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10970.88s)]
*  Also, the OGs have been dead for a long time. [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10972.92s)]
*  They're going to say screw it every song. [[03:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10975.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10977.96s)]
*  Because it's in Pimp and in Bun. [[03:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10978.64s)]
*  I didn't even mention Bun. [[03:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10981.96s)]
*  Bun's on a whole other level. [[03:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10983.56s)]
*  But it's just, man. [[03:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10985.68s)]
*  But it's a cultural mentality thing because over there, you guys all get along. [[03:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10987.96s)]
*  Like we, our major artists, used to beef with each other. [[03:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10992.72s)]
*  So how are you going to root for the guy who's beefing with my guy? [[03:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10996.16s)]
*  We've beefed with each other before, too. [[03:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=10999.039999999999s)]
*  We just never let y'all in on the beef. [[03:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11000.84s)]
*  Oh, that's fair. [[03:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11003.199999999999s)]
*  That's true. [[03:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11004.24s)]
*  That's some southern shit, too. [[03:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11005.64s)]
*  There's also another thing. [[03:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11006.84s)]
*  We would have James Ian Nod's and that's the talking attack. [[03:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11008.039999999999s)]
*  You got to get out of here. You got to flake. [[03:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11011.24s)]
*  But I know what's up with this. [[03:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11012.96s)]
*  But like there is one little thing that I would also say is that there are so many [[03:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11014.119999999999s)]
*  people that move into New York and a lot of New Yorkers that grow up here end up [[03:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11017.8s)]
*  moving out. So there is this kind of like refresh of New Yorkers every 20 years. [[03:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11022.0s)]
*  So a lot of these new people that moved in from all these other places, they don't [[03:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11028.199999999999s)]
*  remember going to the tunnel and seeing these artists. [[03:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11032.32s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[03:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11035.4s)]
*  So they just have no connectivity to it. [[03:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11035.96s)]
*  The OGs that are like staying here tell the stories about it. [[03:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11038.4s)]
*  But then the young people are like, I don't know what you're talking about. [[03:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11041.8s)]
*  I haven't lived that way. [[03:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11044.0s)]
*  So because of that kind of like recycle. [[03:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11045.199999999999s)]
*  Every friend I have from Houston move back. [[03:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11048.119999999999s)]
*  It's crazy. [[03:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11049.72s)]
*  Every friend move back. [[03:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11050.919999999998s)]
*  I do think that plays a little bit. [[03:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11051.919999999998s)]
*  Why wouldn't you come home? [[03:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11053.8s)]
*  Why wouldn't you come home? [[03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11055.679999999998s)]
*  I'm never going back to Dallas to live. [[03:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11056.64s)]
*  It's a giant fucking strip club. [[03:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11058.16s)]
*  I fuck with you. [[03:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11061.4s)]
*  Houston and Dallas. [[03:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11063.4s)]
*  You got to play. You got to play. [[03:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11064.359999999999s)]
*  Listen, Alissabee, go check out Rugged. [[03:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11065.6s)]
*  Go check out. [[03:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11067.48s)]
*  I think you got to check out parts one through four. [[03:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11068.44s)]
*  Watch everything. [[03:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11070.68s)]
*  Just watch it all. [[03:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11071.880000000001s)]
*  There's tons. It's going to be in your algorithm and you're going to enjoy it. [[03:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11072.92s)]
*  We wish you much success, my man. [[03:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11076.08s)]
*  And I definitely see it in the future. [[03:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11077.68s)]
*  When we doing the tour together. [[03:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11079.16s)]
*  That's what I'm talking about. [[03:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11080.52s)]
*  Now we got to talk. [[03:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11081.960000000001s)]
*  Now we're talking. [[03:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11083.16s)]
*  This is a fantastic idea. [[03:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11084.2s)]
*  Independence. [[03:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11085.6s)]
*  Independence forever. [[03:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11086.800000000001s)]
*  Until they drop a hundred mil in our bag. [[03:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11088.68s)]
*  And then we go, we might be a little dependent. [[03:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11090.560000000001s)]
*  I thought it would be independent. [[03:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11093.960000000001s)]
*  Alissabee, everybody. [[03:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yWpsBqyB3A&t=11097.16s)]
