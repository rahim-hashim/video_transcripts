*  What's up everybody? Happy New Year, welcome to flagrant. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=0.0s)]
*  And I've thought of a solution for the Israel-Palestine situation. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4.96s)]
*  Oh, fire. Finally. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  I figured it out. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Finally, dude. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=12.16s)]
*  I've been doing a lot of research and I've been studying it and I figured it out. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=12.88s)]
*  You know what? I believe in your weeks of research, you figured out a 200-year-old conflict. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=16.16s)]
*  Honestly, you would think it'd be very difficult, but it's actually not. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=20.64s)]
*  Okay, hit it. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=24.48s)]
*  Hit it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=25.68s)]
*  We have to make Christians in charge of the area. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  Oh, yeah, this is your right. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=29.36s)]
*  Have I told you this already? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=31.040000000000003s)]
*  No, but I see you trending in this direction. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=32.0s)]
*  Wait, why? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=34.800000000000004s)]
*  Just the whole Christmas is the greatest and blah, blah, blah. Go ahead. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=35.84s)]
*  So jealous. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=39.28s)]
*  Do your thing. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=40.0s)]
*  So jealous. Goofy paint everybody holiday. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=40.88s)]
*  Listen, you don't have a real holiday and it's okay. Christmas is fantastic. We'll get to that later. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=44.64s)]
*  But you need Christianity. You need Christianity. You need Christianity. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=50.64s)]
*  You're not Christian. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=54.88s)]
*  Why can't I extra? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=55.92s)]
*  This one bothers me. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=57.28s)]
*  This one bothers me. This one bothers me. You're not Christian. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=58.88s)]
*  Did I not celebrate Christmas? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=61.92s)]
*  Everybody celebrates Christmas. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=63.440000000000005s)]
*  Exactly. Exactly. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=64.72s)]
*  Yeah, but that'll make you Christian. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=68.0s)]
*  More to celebrating Christmas make you Christian. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=68.8s)]
*  Makes you more Christian. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=70.56s)]
*  Celebrating the birth. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=71.36s)]
*  It's not even his real birthday. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=73.44s)]
*  The birth of our Lord and Savior. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=74.48s)]
*  It's not even his real birthday. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=75.68s)]
*  Hold on, hold on. The birth of our Lord and Savior? What do you mean it's not a real birthday? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=76.48s)]
*  It's not his real birthday. You know this, history man. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=81.76s)]
*  Of course it's his real birthday. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=85.28s)]
*  What do you mean it's not his real birthday? It's the exact day of his birth. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=87.92s)]
*  What was his real birthday? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  Nobody knows. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=92.72s)]
*  Let me see the birth certificate. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=93.68s)]
*  Bro, the birth certificate? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=95.2s)]
*  Are you a birther? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=96.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know Jesus born in Kenya. Jesus born in Kenya. I don't know if you all know that. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=96.8s)]
*  He was a black man. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=101.44s)]
*  No way, bro. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=102.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=103.28s)]
*  I don't want to break his teeth. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=103.68s)]
*  Bronze skin. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=104.56s)]
*  Jesus wasn't even Christian, bro. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=105.36s)]
*  He was Jewish, dude. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=108.56s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  Maybe the Jews should be in charge. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=111.36s)]
*  And they are. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=113.36s)]
*  That's too much. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=113.68s)]
*  Too much. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  That's too much. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=114.80000000000001s)]
*  Jews and Muslims, they can't be in charge. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=116.16s)]
*  They don't know what to do with the responsibility. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=119.11999999999999s)]
*  It's bad for everybody. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=121.36s)]
*  Yeah, we like to run things from the shadows. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=122.32s)]
*  No, you give them high positions of power. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=126.32s)]
*  You give Jews high positions of power. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=128.64s)]
*  Listen, it's the reality. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=130.88s)]
*  Let's start the new year right in the house. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=135.35999999999999s)]
*  It's the reality. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=137.92s)]
*  Jews, you give them high positions of power. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=138.96s)]
*  They're going to do great. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=140.24s)]
*  Everything's going to be fine. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=141.04s)]
*  Muslims, they can't be in charge. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=142.48s)]
*  Can't be in charge. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=144.4s)]
*  Can't do it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=145.68s)]
*  Can't do it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=146.24s)]
*  Listen, I know. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=146.8s)]
*  I know I'm sounding like the Prime Minister of India. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  You haven't seen me disagree yet. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=151.36s)]
*  You know it's not someone getting my back right? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=152.8s)]
*  They can't be in charge. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=154.56s)]
*  It's got to be a little bit mixed up. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=156.16000000000003s)]
*  Can I tell you something? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=157.76000000000002s)]
*  I'm starting to like where this is going. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=158.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=159.92000000000002s)]

*  Okay. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=163.12s)]
*  Listen, yeah, if Christians are in charge, everybody lives great. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=163.84s)]
*  Tell me where Jews, Muslims, Indians, everybody is living better [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=166.96s)]
*  than where Christians are in charge. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=173.68s)]
*  Aren't Indians arguably living better in the West than they are in India? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=175.92000000000002s)]

*  You just said yeah. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=188.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=189.76000000000002s)]
*  They're living better in the West. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=190.08s)]
*  Of course they're living better. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=191.84s)]
*  Because of Jesus, bro. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=192.8s)]
*  Y'all need Jesus to be your greatest. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  No, it's not true. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=197.52s)]
*  Throwing confetti around ain't going to make you great. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=198.24s)]
*  Bow in to the Lord. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=200.88s)]
*  We bow. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  Aren't some of the happiest countries in the Netherlands and aren't they atheists? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=203.6s)]
*  I didn't say happy. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=207.04s)]
*  No. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  I didn't say happy. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=210.32s)]
*  Maybe lion. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  It's the highest quality of life. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=214.72s)]
*  That's because they ain't got no Muslims. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=216.48s)]
*  Again, I like where you're going. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=221.12s)]
*  It's pure white people up there. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=222.0s)]
*  That's the only thing that makes white people upset. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=225.51999999999998s)]
*  No, but I do think they got some Christianity. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=229.44s)]
*  They got the best quality of life. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=231.84s)]
*  They're the happiest. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  They're not that religious. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=233.84s)]
*  They're Christians without the Christianity. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=234.88s)]
*  What's that? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=239.28s)]
*  That's you. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=239.84s)]
*  Nice to their neighbors and shit. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=240.64000000000001s)]
*  Can you just put some respect on the fact that with Christianity, everybody lives better? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=246.88s)]
*  No, it's not true. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=253.6s)]
*  Why y'all flocking to Jesus then? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=254.88s)]
*  Who's flocking to Jesus? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=258.0s)]

*  I should be bald. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2210.08s)]

*  Now let's get back to the show. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2254.4s)]
*  Gypsy Rose is for you, bro. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2255.44s)]
*  All right. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2256.88s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2258.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2259.92s)]
*  Nah. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2261.52s)]
*  Gypsy Rose look like an Albanian mother of two from the Bronx. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2262.8s)]
*  Gypsy Rose, all right. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2269.28s)]
*  Top comment is fire. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2270.96s)]
*  What is it? [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2272.1600000000003s)]
*  Maybe out of prison, but she's still serving 24-7. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2272.6400000000003s)]
*  Okay, so break it down to me. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2276.8s)]
*  You can't kill your mom if she's literally... [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2278.16s)]
*  What exactly did she do? [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2282.08s)]
*  She had to take a bunch of drugs. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2283.52s)]
*  She had the Munchausen syndrome by proxy. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2284.64s)]
*  So I guess Munchausen's is when you think a bunch of shit is wrong with you [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2287.3599999999997s)]
*  and you need to be, just convince everybody you're sick. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2290.56s)]
*  Probably believe it yourself. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2293.2s)]
*  Munchausen by proxy is doing that to someone else. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2294.7999999999997s)]
*  So she kept telling doctors she had, I think, leukemia, [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2297.52s)]
*  would keep shaving her head, literally had her salivary glands removed. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2300.72s)]
*  That sounds like no fun for anybody. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2304.3199999999997s)]
*  You should be able to kill your moms in that case. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2306.08s)]
*  I think so. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2307.68s)]
*  But again, can't you claim momentary insanity? [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2308.3199999999997s)]
*  The problem is her and her, the boyfriend who actually killed her, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2312.64s)]
*  there's apparently a lot of text messages where it's premeditated. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2316.3999999999996s)]
*  But can't you be insane for the whole time that your mother's torturing you? [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2319.8399999999997s)]
*  It's a tougher thing, but it wouldn't necessarily be hard to say temporary insanity if it's been... [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2324.56s)]
*  Fair, not temporary insanity, but couldn't you just be induced? [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2328.3999999999996s)]
*  Didn't you have this state of insanity induced by decades of treatment [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2331.3599999999997s)]
*  or however old the fuck she was? [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2335.6s)]
*  I think that's what you should be able to do. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2336.96s)]
*  Wherever you wish you got sent us, bro. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2338.64s)]
*  You could have saved her. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2340.0s)]
*  I would have saved her. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2340.8s)]
*  You could have saved the courtroom. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2341.52s)]
*  I would have saved her. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2343.12s)]
*  I saved Al. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2343.6s)]
*  I would have saved her right there. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2346.0s)]
*  I saved you from getting fucking raped by some Swedish guy in your asshole. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2347.44s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2351.36s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2353.36s)]
*  What is this? [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2355.36s)]
*  The police are coming. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2357.36s)]
*  Call yourself a police officer. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2359.36s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2361.36s)]
*  All right, this shit is so far. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2362.0s)]
*  You haven't seen this? [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2363.28s)]
*  No. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2364.08s)]
*  Basically, they just post videos of the sea. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2364.96s)]
*  The North Sea is incredibly dangerous, bro. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2366.96s)]
*  And then they play this song. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2369.84s)]
*  This is actually our boy Colin McGee. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2371.76s)]
*  Yo, Gypsy Rose. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2373.36s)]
*  Yo. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2376.48s)]
*  It goes crazy. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2379.12s)]
*  You write black people do make everything better. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2379.68s)]
*  Cause y'all sitting here watching this. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2381.52s)]
*  No, no, do the video with the boat. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2383.2s)]
*  My man, why are we looking at Brian Greenberg? [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2385.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2388.0s)]
*  I said, y'all at home watching that? [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2388.64s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2390.88s)]
*  Yo, Gypsy Rose looking through that camera, man. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2391.6s)]
*  Right? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2393.92s)]
*  I'm done. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2395.04s)]
*  I feel connected. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2395.6s)]
*  I feel super connected. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2396.2400000000002s)]
*  I'll kill her grandma. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2397.6s)]
*  Her grandma's still alive. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2398.48s)]
*  Who you need to kill, bitch? [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2399.44s)]
*  You can see how it would work on a young, impressionable kid. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2403.68s)]
*  Absolutely, dog. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2406.16s)]
*  Wow. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2407.2s)]
*  Yo, boyfriend got life in prison? [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2413.44s)]
*  I don't think that's fair. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2414.8s)]
*  I can't. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2416.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2416.64s)]
*  What did? [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2418.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2418.4s)]
*  I almost asked what her mom got. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2418.8s)]
*  Justice. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2420.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, she's up, dude. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2421.28s)]
*  But that is crazy that he got that. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2422.64s)]
*  I'm trying to think. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2424.3999999999996s)]
*  I was trying to think. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2424.96s)]
*  So what I was reading, I was trying to think how they got there. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2425.68s)]
*  There was one text he sent to her where he said he has an evil side and he enjoys killing. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2428.0s)]
*  And he used present tense. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2432.72s)]
*  He never say future tense I would enjoy. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2434.3199999999997s)]
*  But that's where he might talk to a girl. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2437.68s)]
*  Right? [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2439.52s)]
*  I mean, a sexual talk for them, maybe at this point. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2440.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2442.3199999999997s)]
*  I'll say my shit nine and a half inches thick. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2442.7999999999997s)]
*  That's right. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2445.2s)]
*  He didn't say it was silly putty stretch. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2446.24s)]
*  He didn't say his poor and sickly silly putty stretch to nine and a half. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2449.52s)]
*  Fruit by the foot. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2454.0s)]
*  Come on, dude. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2454.96s)]
*  Yeah, I gotta pause that. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2455.68s)]
*  So. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2457.04s)]
*  Nah, but dude stabbed her up while crazy. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2459.04s)]
*  Like that's a different type of. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2462.08s)]
*  That was the most New York sentence I've ever heard in my entire life. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2463.12s)]
*  Nah, but dude stabbed her up while crazy. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2466.96s)]
*  Because that is more difficult. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2469.36s)]
*  It's more difficult than like shooting a bitch. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2473.44s)]
*  Stabbing is anger and hate. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2475.84s)]
*  But what if? [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2477.36s)]
*  But she deserved anger and hate, dude. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2477.92s)]
*  And imagine the human being. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2479.6s)]
*  He loved this girl. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2480.32s)]
*  She abused the fuck out of her for decades. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2481.04s)]
*  Literally had her in a wheelchair convinced she couldn't walk, which is crazy. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2484.0s)]
*  Made her take cancer meds. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2487.04s)]
*  She could walk completely fine. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2490.56s)]
*  Her mother was like, you're confined to a wheelchair. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2492.4s)]
*  Chained her to a bed, apparently. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2494.96s)]
*  Did she get. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2496.32s)]
*  I mean, I'd be seeing white parents have their kids on leashes. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2497.36s)]
*  That's a good idea. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2499.6800000000003s)]
*  I think that's a good idea. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2500.88s)]
*  Much. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2501.92s)]
*  I like the leash thing. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2502.8s)]
*  Why do we give pushback on the leash? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2503.6800000000003s)]
*  Because it just looks so dog like. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2505.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2508.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2510.48s)]
*  Is that bad? [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2510.88s)]
*  We love our dogs. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2511.36s)]
*  It feels like you're dehumanizing a kid to a dog's level. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2512.48s)]
*  I don't think. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2515.52s)]
*  We love dogs. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2515.76s)]
*  I love dogs. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2516.4s)]
*  But when you got a kid on a leash, the visual of it. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2517.2s)]
*  I understand the idea is I don't want my kid to run. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2519.84s)]
*  But even if like the leash was attached to your chest and y'all are just like there together, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2522.72s)]
*  that's different than holding a leash. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2527.2s)]
*  That's actually a fucking great distinction. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2530.0s)]
*  We should make that fun. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2531.84s)]
*  If the leash isn't in your hands. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2532.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2534.8s)]
*  If it's just belt to belt. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2535.28s)]
*  Then it's kind of like one of those things where you carry the baby right here. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2536.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2539.68s)]
*  Just with an umbilical cord. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2540.16s)]
*  You just thought about this right now? [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2541.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2542.88s)]
*  That's a guy. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2543.2s)]
*  We should do this. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2543.84s)]
*  As a belt to belt is umbilical cord. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2544.4s)]
*  Don't even call it a leash. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2546.56s)]
*  Call it the cord. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2547.52s)]
*  But I also think y'all underestimate how much white people like our dogs. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2550.08s)]
*  So when we treat our kids like a dog, it's actually a good thing. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2553.36s)]
*  I love my dog. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2556.16s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2556.96s)]
*  You can't be kissing them on the lift. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2557.28s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2558.72s)]
*  You can't kiss a kid. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2559.44s)]
*  I'm saying. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2560.56s)]
*  I'm upset on my dog. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2562.4s)]
*  Don't kiss me back. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2563.36s)]
*  If I put my nose close and I don't get a lick, I'm tight. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2564.8s)]
*  I'm like, what the hell did I do? [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2568.4s)]
*  Is that how you punish your dog though? [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2570.3999999999996s)]
*  If your dog poops on the ground? [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2571.44s)]
*  No kisses. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2573.2s)]
*  Don't make out with your dog. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2574.0s)]
*  No kisses. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2574.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2575.44s)]
*  I won't give her any love. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2575.6s)]
*  No kisses. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=2577.3599999999997s)]

*  No, what is it? [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3136.88s)]
*  It's very funny. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3137.6s)]
*  He apologized in Hebrew and he was like, [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3138.64s)]
*  I sincerely apologize to the Jewish community for any unintended outbursts [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3140.88s)]
*  caused by my words or actions. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3143.92s)]
*  Didn't mean to offend, demean, yada, yada, yada. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3145.36s)]
*  And that's the whole apology. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3148.32s)]
*  And then the Anti-Defamation League was like, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3149.84s)]
*  this is a beyond bizarre ploy to get more attention. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3153.6800000000003s)]
*  And the Hebrew apology without translation is inaccessible to most American Jews who [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3157.52s)]
*  do not speak the language. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3160.88s)]
*  To be sure, using Hebrew to communicate with the Jewish community [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3162.4s)]
*  and denies most Americans and American Jews and non-Jews to see his apology. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3165.44s)]
*  Can't be honest. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3169.28s)]

*  The funniest response. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3174.24s)]
*  We can't be that annoying. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3174.7999999999997s)]
*  It's the funniest. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3176.0s)]
*  The response was so funny. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3178.72s)]
*  I was like, just let it be. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3180.9599999999996s)]
*  I do not claim that response. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3182.72s)]
*  I mean, just call it, it's just called a bullshit apology from Kanye. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3184.72s)]
*  Clearly he doesn't give a flying fuck, but. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3188.0s)]
*  I believe it. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3190.3999999999996s)]
*  I believe it. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3192.16s)]

*  That's the other thing. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3199.6s)]
*  They found out it was just chat GPT. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3200.72s)]
*  Yeah, chat GPT. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3202.16s)]
*  After looking at some of these pictures, I believe him this time. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3203.84s)]
*  I believe him. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3206.56s)]
*  I think he's turned over a new leaf. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3207.12s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3208.48s)]
*  That's Christianity right there. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3209.52s)]
*  That's Christianity. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3211.92s)]
*  Yep. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3212.8s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3222.96s)]
*  But can we talk about how that's Christianity? [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3223.76s)]
*  Just can we just talk about that? [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3226.96s)]
*  That dude. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3228.6400000000003s)]
*  Christianity produced that. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3229.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's Catholicism actually. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3231.44s)]
*  She's Italian, right? [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3232.8s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3233.84s)]
*  Not necessarily. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3234.8s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3235.68s)]
*  They would never. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3236.16s)]
*  No, I couldn't. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3237.44s)]
*  Most likely. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3238.4s)]
*  Playing the percentages, she's probably Catholic. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3239.04s)]
*  But Catholicism formed Christianity. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3242.16s)]
*  Can I show you some crazy shit real quick? [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3245.2s)]
*  I cannot wait. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3247.28s)]
*  Obviously. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3247.92s)]

*  So these are two twins. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3257.28s)]
*  I've seen this before. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3258.7200000000003s)]
*  Jerked off to it several times. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3259.52s)]
*  Be specific because I'm about to get fucking crusades on you. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3261.76s)]
*  All right? [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3264.96s)]
*  So you got to be specific here. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3265.28s)]
*  Can we just have this segment every show? [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3266.7200000000003s)]
*  So these are twin sisters. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3270.0800000000004s)]
*  All right? [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3271.44s)]

*  The other one is a fitness person. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3275.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3278.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3280.4s)]

*  Okay. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3285.92s)]
*  Now, you seem to be using the premise [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3286.8s)]
*  that it is somewhat shocking that a woman of God would be beautiful. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3292.1600000000003s)]
*  To me, that is in no way shocking. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3296.96s)]
*  No. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3300.0s)]

*  And even more beautiful if they believe in the one true God [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3303.1200000000003s)]
*  and our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3305.76s)]

*  That's fire. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3312.0800000000004s)]
*  But now? [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3313.1200000000003s)]

*  Bunch of girls are probably scared, but then they're like, oh, he's gay. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3393.76s)]
*  He could do the double approach where they think he's like just a friend. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3396.48s)]
*  They think he's 100% gay, not 49. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3399.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3402.1600000000003s)]
*  Fully gay. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3403.04s)]
*  And then he whips the dick out. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3404.4s)]
*  Gypsy Rose is looking through that lens, bro. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3405.6000000000004s)]

*  Let's get her on the pod, dude. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3410.32s)]
*  Her man is still in prison. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3412.2400000000002s)]
*  Let me see some other pictures of her. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3413.28s)]
*  Oh yeah, we do want her on the pod. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3414.6400000000003s)]
*  You should cut the thing I said earlier. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3416.0800000000004s)]
*  Keep that. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3418.96s)]
*  Mickey Mouse is free. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3421.36s)]
*  The mouse is free. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3424.2400000000002s)]
*  The mouse is out the house. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3425.1200000000003s)]
*  Disney has lost their decades-long battle. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3427.76s)]
*  To maintain the intellectual property to the Mickey Mouse character. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3433.2000000000003s)]
*  I think that back in the day it was what? [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3438.96s)]
*  How long could you own the rights or something? [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3440.88s)]
*  It used to be way shorter, but Disney's been pushing that through litigation for like 40, 50 years. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3443.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3448.7200000000003s)]
*  And they've been trying to push it back because they feel like their whole brand is wrapped around it. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3449.52s)]
*  It is. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3452.6400000000003s)]
*  You could argue, I mean, I feel like now they're so far removed. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3453.6800000000003s)]
*  I guess it's such a conglomerate. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3456.8s)]
*  The Marvel is a property and all these other things. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3458.2400000000002s)]
*  But at the time it's like if you have this Mickey Mouse cartoon and then your competitor can also write a Mickey Mouse cartoon, there's nothing you could do about it. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3460.24s)]
*  I understand the concern. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3467.68s)]
*  So technically not all Mickey Mouse is out of trademark. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3468.9599999999996s)]
*  It's the first one. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3472.72s)]
*  Steamboat Willie. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3473.7599999999998s)]
*  Can we see what that guy looks like? [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3475.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3476.56s)]
*  No, Steamboat Willie fired. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3478.64s)]
*  They still use Steamboat Willie and shit. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3480.7999999999997s)]
*  They just started bringing it back. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3482.3199999999997s)]
*  If you go to Disney World, you don't see that. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3483.68s)]
*  But that shit is tough, yo. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3485.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of cool. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3487.4399999999996s)]
*  And why was he driving a steamboat? [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3488.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3491.3599999999997s)]
*  I guess that was his job at the time. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3491.7599999999998s)]
*  Maybe on the high seas. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3493.7599999999998s)]
*  When he was on that shit? [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3494.64s)]
*  Yeah, did you hear that? [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3495.6s)]
*  He was yelping probably. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3496.24s)]
*  No windshield wipers on this guy. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3497.6s)]
*  Fucking thug ripping it around. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3499.52s)]
*  But yeah, so this guy's on trademark now. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3502.16s)]
*  People are making movies about him. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3503.8399999999997s)]
*  They've been like plotting on this for a while because it's been a hundred years since this came out, I'm pretty sure. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3505.44s)]
*  So now they got a, this movie is called the Mickey Mouse Trap. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3509.7599999999998s)]
*  Trailer just dropped today. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3514.56s)]
*  Damn, turn it off, please, James! [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3518.64s)]
*  She is murdered by Mickey Mouse, bro. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3524.16s)]
*  Whoa, sure murder. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3525.92s)]
*  And then they came out with a video game a while ago. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3527.6s)]
*  This is like last year, I think. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3529.8399999999997s)]
*  But it's coming out this year. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3530.8799999999997s)]
*  That's like another like Mickey Mouse is like a rat infestation. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3531.8399999999997s)]
*  They got to kill all the Mickey Mouses. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3535.52s)]
*  I mean, these are great ideas. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3538.16s)]
*  Just like in terms of getting garnering attention. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3539.52s)]
*  The best way to do it is a horror movie where Mickey Mouse kills you. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3542.16s)]
*  Well, the reason they also do horror movies is that they did this with Winnie the Pooh, [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3544.72s)]
*  a couple years ago, is because the parent company won't come after you. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3548.24s)]
*  Because you're not representing Mickey Mouse in any way that Disney did. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3551.68s)]
*  Yeah, so it's actually, it's why porn and horror take these characters and run with them, [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3556.72s)]
*  is because they're not going to come after them. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3561.04s)]
*  It's so far removed from the original. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3562.9599999999996s)]
*  They're not worried about your, yeah, your little movie. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3564.56s)]
*  But if you made one that was like Mickey Mouse goes and does something fun, [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3567.52s)]
*  they're going to be like, yeah, we'll catch you. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3570.0s)]
*  You make a theme park based on Mickey Mouse, they're going to go cut that shit out. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3572.16s)]
*  Could you go back to that list right there? [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3576.08s)]
*  I want to say something real quick. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3577.6s)]
*  Where are we in this Simone Biles and her husband's calling himself the prize situation? [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3580.4s)]
*  Her husband plays in NFL. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3587.12s)]
*  Yeah, you think he plays safety for the Texans, I think. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3588.96s)]
*  I don't know him, so I don't know if he's good or not. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3592.3199999999997s)]
*  Have y'all seen the clip? [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3594.72s)]
*  So you was really the catch in, I always say we demand a catch, man. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3596.88s)]
*  I always say we the catch, man. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3601.2799999999997s)]
*  That's right. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3602.72s)]
*  She really booked you. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3603.6s)]
*  She did though. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3604.72s)]
*  Is what you said. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3605.52s)]
*  I was fighting it. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3607.2000000000003s)]
*  I was fighting it. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3607.92s)]
*  So in truth, if I say this out loud, was Jonathan Owens ain't really want Simone Biles. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3608.88s)]
*  Is what you said. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3615.76s)]
*  I was afraid. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3619.92s)]
*  I was afraid to commit. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3621.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm like, man, this is my third year. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3622.96s)]
*  You know, I'm trying to, I'm like, it's kind of early. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3626.4s)]
*  But you know, like I said, man, it happened. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3630.08s)]
*  Nick. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3631.84s)]
*  I mean Shorty's right there, right? [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3635.92s)]
*  That's honest though. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3644.1600000000003s)]
*  He's being honest. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3645.1200000000003s)]
*  I didn't think it was that bad. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3646.2400000000002s)]
*  That's blown out of proportion. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3647.28s)]
*  Yeah, but do you honestly think he didn't know who she was? [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3648.4s)]
*  His story kind of adds up, but you're like, dude, you play sports. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3651.1200000000003s)]

*  I mean, he's been in the league for a few years, [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3750.0s)]
*  so he can't be bad. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3751.44s)]
*  I mean, it's more rare. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3752.96s)]
*  This is going to be rough. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3756.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3757.6s)]
*  Yeah, this is a bumpy one you're heading. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3758.16s)]
*  But it's true. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3759.84s)]
*  It's harder for a girl to lock down a football player [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3763.12s)]
*  than it is for a guy to give a fuck about gymnastics. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3769.2s)]
*  He said it at the end. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3777.6s)]
*  At the end, it made sense. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3778.56s)]
*  My point is like her success is not necessarily something [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3779.68s)]
*  that guys are looking for when they're trying to find a mate. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3783.28s)]
*  They're like, I want an Olympian. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3787.44s)]
*  I want a gymnastics Olympian. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3789.28s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3790.56s)]
*  So the metric. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3791.28s)]
*  We don't care. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3791.92s)]
*  But him playing in the NFL might be something [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3793.2s)]
*  that women are curious about. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3796.48s)]
*  So what you're trying to say, for real this time, I think. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3798.56s)]
*  He's the catch. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3801.28s)]
*  You've got to look at it. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3802.0s)]
*  He is the catch. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3802.88s)]
*  You've got to look at it through the lens [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3803.92s)]
*  of what they're attracted to. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3805.12s)]
*  That's it. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3806.88s)]
*  He's the catch. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3807.92s)]
*  There are millions. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3809.44s)]
*  Because women are attracted to talented men. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3810.8s)]
*  Men don't really care about no matter how talented you are. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3812.88s)]
*  It's cool. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3815.36s)]
*  It's a bonus. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3815.6800000000003s)]
*  But it's not something we're going to be like, oh, I need a girl [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3816.64s)]
*  that's super talented at XYZ. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3819.52s)]
*  Whereas if you're very talented at anything as a man, [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3821.84s)]
*  you do have value to women. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3823.84s)]
*  Like, for example, if your girl was nice at basketball [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3825.12s)]
*  and she could beat you. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3828.0s)]
*  That's a detriment. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3829.76s)]
*  I'm not marrying her. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3830.8s)]
*  You're out of your fucking mind. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3831.84s)]
*  That hurts her. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3833.44s)]
*  You get those wild races when you just said it. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3834.64s)]
*  Why are you so racist over there? [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3840.48s)]
*  Son, I'm just saying, if she's nice at basketball, bro. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3842.0s)]
*  A black Christian woman. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3847.04s)]
*  If she's nice at basketball, you know Al's not going to be [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3848.4s)]
*  with her at all. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3851.6s)]
*  No. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3853.2s)]
*  But for real, yeah, he is the catch. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3854.08s)]
*  What he has is more rare and more coveted by women [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3857.2s)]
*  than what she has. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3859.92s)]
*  That doesn't mean this time. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3861.12s)]
*  What she has is more rare standing alone. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3862.0s)]
*  What she has is more rare. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3864.64s)]
*  She's the greatest at her thing. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3865.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm saying only in terms of attraction. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3867.36s)]
*  But in terms of, yeah, for what we're attracted to, [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3868.88s)]
*  we're just more attracted to looks and personality. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3872.64s)]
*  It's like Sex and the City, that girl that does the writing. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3874.96s)]
*  What's her name? [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3877.2s)]
*  Carrie or whatever. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3878.56s)]
*  Nobody care about your blog, bitch. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3880.56s)]

*  Aiden don't care. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3886.0s)]
*  Aiden's making furniture. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3887.04s)]

*  Mr. Big don't care. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3888.88s)]
*  My man's in the markets. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3889.84s)]

*  When they perform at the top of your field, [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3898.1600000000003s)]
*  like Beyonce, people cared about. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3900.2400000000002s)]
*  But Beyonce was gorgeous already. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3902.0s)]
*  Simone Biles is a beautiful girl, but it's a bonus. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3903.28s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3905.1200000000003s)]
*  I don't like the way you said that. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3905.6800000000003s)]
*  I said gorgeous. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3909.44s)]
*  Yeah, she's all right. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3910.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you did call Simone Biles ugly. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3911.6000000000004s)]
*  It was fucked up. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3913.76s)]
*  That shit was fucked up. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3914.4s)]
*  What you said. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3916.48s)]
*  When Simone Biles was an Olympian, she was under 18, [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3917.2000000000003s)]
*  so I didn't really look at her with that lens. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3919.6000000000004s)]
*  Maybe Alex did. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3920.96s)]
*  Oh, but you busted out the Bianca Sensori's right there, bro. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3921.6s)]
*  You didn't have to bust out that Bianca. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3937.52s)]
*  Okay. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3940.7200000000003s)]
*  The internet is wrong once again. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3943.36s)]
*  That's all I'm trying to say. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3945.2s)]
*  Why can't they both be catches though? [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3946.0s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3947.68s)]
*  I think Simone Biles is probably a catch because she's probably an awesome girlfriend, [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3948.4s)]
*  incredibly sweet, kind, loving, and they spent time together during COVID, [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3954.48s)]
*  which is probably beneficial. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3958.56s)]
*  They get to meet each other, really know each other without all the distractions of [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3959.52s)]
*  going out, you're on the road nonstop, etc. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3962.88s)]
*  That's probably what makes her the catch. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=3965.04s)]

*  Simone Biles. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4069.2s)]

*  But again, we're saying just by the standards, the standards men are attracted to versus [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4073.2799999999997s)]
*  the things men are attracted to versus the things women are attracted to. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4078.08s)]
*  You're talking about things that objectively or whatever to women for sure. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4081.44s)]
*  Oh, she makes more money, what a catch. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4086.08s)]

*  No, I've had way worse. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4383.280000000001s)]
*  I've done better than that. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4386.8s)]
*  Okay, boys. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4390.240000000001s)]
*  This is kind of fire. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4391.04s)]
*  What else we got? [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4392.0s)]
*  I know we got some things that we got to discuss. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4392.72s)]
*  I mean, there's the Epstein client list. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4394.64s)]
*  There's a fucking list drop yet. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4395.84s)]
*  I mean, Clinton's definitely exonerated. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4398.400000000001s)]
*  Right? [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4401.04s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4401.4400000000005s)]
*  But apparently he's gonna be on there a couple of times. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4402.8s)]
*  That's the word. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4404.4800000000005s)]
*  Those are the words saying. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4404.88s)]
*  They were just saying how he's innocent. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4406.32s)]
*  I still don't understand how you could just choose to not have your name. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4407.6s)]
*  Well, you can petition the judge. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4411.04s)]
*  If you want your name on there, it's because in some way it liberates you. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4413.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4416.96s)]
*  That was Dershowitz. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4417.2s)]
*  So Dershowitz was like, yo, put my shit on. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4418.400000000001s)]
*  And for years he was like, yo, release the files. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4420.4800000000005s)]
*  He was like one of the big proponents of it. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4422.24s)]
*  Because it's gonna make him look better. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4423.6s)]
*  Because he was like, look, you'll see. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4424.88s)]
*  Apparently same. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4426.24s)]
*  No accusations. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4427.04s)]
*  I knew Clinton was innocent. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4427.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4429.4400000000005s)]
*  How'd you know? [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4430.8s)]
*  Because I liked him. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4432.08s)]
*  If I like somebody, I want them to be innocent so I don't have to stop liking them. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4433.92s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4437.36s)]
*  I don't think he was going to the island. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4437.92s)]
*  I think he was on a plane. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4440.16s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4442.08s)]
*  You saw R.F.K. Jr. say he was on the plane. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4442.88s)]
*  What is that? [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4445.12s)]
*  It's so funny. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4445.6s)]
*  Oh, did R.F.K. come out? [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4446.24s)]
*  He was with Waters was the guy from Fox. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4447.04s)]
*  Jesse Waters. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4449.36s)]
*  Yeah, Jesse Waters. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4449.84s)]
*  And they were like, you were never on Epstein's plane. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4450.4s)]
*  He was like, look, I gotta be honest. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4452.0s)]
*  I've been on the plane twice. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4453.6s)]
*  One time to go visit my mother in Florida. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4455.12s)]
*  The other time to do a weekend fossil hunting expedition with my children. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4456.8s)]
*  I was like, fossil hunting? [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4462.08s)]
*  Yo, you've taken your kids on that guy's fucking plane? [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4464.08s)]
*  But he said it was in the 90s. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4466.5599999999995s)]
*  It was before everyone knew what was going on. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4467.599999999999s)]
*  In the 90s, before. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4468.799999999999s)]
*  Thank God. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4469.919999999999s)]
*  But that was an insane weekend activity with these kids fossil hunting, [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4470.16s)]
*  which is all that's the opposite of pedophilia, I think. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4472.639999999999s)]
*  It's just looking for fossils, old shit. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4474.4s)]
*  Yo. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4475.679999999999s)]
*  Like I'm looking for the oldest thing ever. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4476.0s)]
*  That's a great point. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4477.2s)]
*  True. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4477.919999999999s)]
*  But it's also so funny to go fossil hunting as like a weekend activity. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4478.24s)]
*  This is what rich people do, man. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4482.08s)]
*  They gotta invent new shit. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4483.44s)]
*  It's getting boring. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4484.639999999999s)]
*  This blew my mind. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4485.5199999999995s)]
*  It's getting boring. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4486.48s)]
*  Did you know that was a thing to do? [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4487.28s)]
*  Catholics, I'm just saying, I don't want to buy. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4488.5599999999995s)]
*  That's Catholics. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4491.28s)]
*  That does sound like some Catholics. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4491.92s)]
*  That is Catholics. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4492.96s)]
*  Christians would never do that. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4494.320000000001s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4495.68s)]
*  Christians don't do that. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4496.56s)]

*  We just gotta find some way to do something to his fucking voice. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4512.24s)]
*  I don't know if I could listen to that shit for two and a half hours straight. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4515.68s)]
*  What would we do? [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4518.96s)]
*  What is something that we can do? [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4520.16s)]
*  Give him a cough drop. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4521.5199999999995s)]
*  Clear it right up. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4522.8s)]
*  Now, now, hold on now. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4524.0s)]
*  I think he may have tried that. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4530.24s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4532.08s)]
*  You don't think he's ever tried it? [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4532.96s)]
*  Has any of you have been? [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4534.0s)]
*  Has he tried this? [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4534.8s)]
*  Have you seen him? [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4535.5199999999995s)]
*  Have you tried that? [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4536.0s)]
*  That might work. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4538.16s)]
*  He should try that one. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4540.08s)]
*  That probably works. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4540.96s)]
*  You guys are fucking assholes, dude. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4541.6s)]
*  I think that would work. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4543.44s)]
*  You guys are jerks, man. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4544.24s)]
*  It could work. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4545.04s)]
*  I can't believe what you just said. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4545.68s)]
*  What do you use for a sore throat, Andrew? [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4548.16s)]
*  Cough. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4550.96s)]
*  You just heard his feelings really bad. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4554.24s)]
*  You just heard his feelings really bad. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4559.28s)]
*  This guy's really mean. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4560.72s)]
*  His feelings. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4561.76s)]
*  Cough was getting to him so fast. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4562.48s)]
*  Now, he's all put out of shape like a gay guy. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4564.8s)]
*  Because his feelings are hurt. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4566.88s)]
*  Why'd you do that? [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4567.68s)]
*  He didn't deny it. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4568.08s)]
*  That guy's so mean. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4569.44s)]
*  Crazy how mean you are. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4571.6s)]
*  Wait, you didn't deny it. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4572.8s)]
*  Here I am, furiously searching for our next topic. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4574.16s)]
*  And you're just taking pot shots at me nonstop. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4577.44s)]
*  And those feelings are all hurt, bro. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4579.92s)]
*  Come on. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4581.2s)]
*  Just so fucking disrespectful. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4581.84s)]
*  Come on, Alex. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4583.12s)]
*  All right, what did Keith Lee say about New York's food? [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4584.08s)]
*  Where'd we rank? [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4586.88s)]
*  Last. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4588.4s)]
*  Nah, that's not funny. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4589.2s)]
*  He wasn't last. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4589.92s)]
*  He wasn't last. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4590.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh, Atlanta was last. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4591.28s)]
*  I think we were seven. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4592.24s)]
*  Atlanta was last. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4593.12s)]
*  And I don't blame him because he got bad wrecks. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4594.8s)]
*  New Orleans. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4598.4s)]
*  New Orleans? [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4599.6s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4600.4s)]
*  Nobody's pushing back on that. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4601.92s)]
*  Houston? [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4603.2s)]
*  Yeah, I could see that. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4605.52s)]
*  I might flip two and three. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4606.8s)]
*  I love Chicago as a food city, but yeah, Houston's great food. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4608.4s)]
*  Texas. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4611.28s)]
*  I mean, we were just in Chicago shots. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4611.44s)]
*  Everybody who came out to the shows, appreciate y'all. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4613.2s)]
*  That was fucking awesome. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4615.12s)]
*  But nah, Chicago's not even coming close to New York when it comes to food. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4617.92s)]
*  It's not even... [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4620.48s)]
*  Like what are they... [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4620.96s)]
*  You know what I was thinking about? [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4622.32s)]
*  Because honestly, New York does have great food, but it has a lot of good like foodie food. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4623.36s)]
*  Like refined cuisine, like fine dining and stuff. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4627.5199999999995s)]
*  He's going to like mom and pop shops. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4631.5199999999995s)]
*  And also there's so many mom and pop shops in New York that you're [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4633.839999999999s)]
*  probably just kind of choosing. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4637.68s)]
*  You don't really know exactly where to go. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4638.56s)]
*  Everybody got their own bodega that they like. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4640.0s)]
*  So he's just going off recommendations. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4642.56s)]
*  And I love Texas, but I go home to Dallas. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4644.8s)]
*  It's all fucking franchises, it's nauseating. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4646.8s)]
*  So the mom and pop shops, the shops at last are like, oh, these are great. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4649.200000000001s)]
*  These stand out. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4653.92s)]
*  You gotta go there. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4655.04s)]
*  Those are going to slap. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4655.76s)]
*  So I think that might be why New York great. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4657.360000000001s)]
*  The lower end of... [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4659.76s)]
*  Now this is, he's ranking these places based on what he experienced. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4660.4800000000005s)]
*  And he says that. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4665.84s)]
*  He's like very like, I'm not saying it's bad. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4666.4s)]
*  I just didn't have as good of an experience. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4668.48s)]
*  I may not gotten good recs, whatever. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4669.839999999999s)]
*  He like buffers it all. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4671.36s)]
*  I'm fine with the list. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4672.639999999999s)]
*  Like you'll come back and then he'll do, you know, go to some other places. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4673.759999999999s)]
*  He did a salmon. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4678.16s)]
*  What was it? [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4679.12s)]
*  Salmon, egg and cheese or whatever? [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4679.599999999999s)]
*  No, salmon chopped cheese. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4680.5599999999995s)]
*  Salmon chopped cheese. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4682.24s)]
*  Have you ever even heard of that? [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4683.12s)]
*  I mean, it's just crazy. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4684.48s)]
*  Somebody sent him up. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4685.44s)]
*  Yeah, he did get, yeah, he did get a okey-doke. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4686.639999999999s)]
*  I just never knew Vegas was really known for good food. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4690.96s)]
*  It's not. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4695.92s)]
*  It's not. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4696.88s)]
*  But again, he goes. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4697.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's not. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4697.92s)]
*  And it's not even... [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4698.8s)]
*  I just never heard anybody say that. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4699.28s)]
*  Nobody's ever said that once. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4700.8s)]
*  I wouldn't even make it reflective of the city's food. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4701.92s)]
*  I would just make it reflective of the small businesses that are there that stand out. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4704.0s)]
*  Yeah, I did. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4707.76s)]
*  Because he's getting recs. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4708.24s)]
*  Small businesses. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4709.12s)]
*  Again, you're getting, if you say you're going to New York and where should I eat? [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4709.76s)]
*  And a million people listen to this pod. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4712.96s)]
*  They're going to send you a million different recommendations. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4714.56s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4717.28s)]
*  If you say I'm going to Vegas, you're going to get a million recommendations. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4717.68s)]
*  There's going to be like four places to stand out over and over again. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4720.0s)]
*  Yo, can I ask you a question? [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4722.96s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4724.24s)]
*  What's up with... [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4725.04s)]
*  Why can't John Morant shoot into the crap? [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4727.28s)]
*  Well, last year he was... [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4730.72s)]
*  He had charges, gun charges. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4732.56s)]
*  That was a suspension from the league. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4734.24s)]
*  Yeah, we understand that part. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4735.6s)]
*  But he's just doing a dance. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4738.32s)]
*  It's stupid to do. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4739.92s)]
*  But I think people are making too big of a deal out of it. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4741.36s)]
*  100%. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4743.28s)]
*  It's just a dance. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4744.56s)]
*  Now, he has to be aware that he's contributed to this. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4745.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, you're not guilt free. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4748.88s)]
*  It's stupid to do. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4750.72s)]
*  Yeah, but at the same time... [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4751.6s)]
*  It is just a celebration that people do. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4753.6s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like he's not the only one. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4755.6s)]
*  But the reason he's getting headlines obviously is because of the thing. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4757.120000000001s)]
*  Because he fucked up. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4759.52s)]
*  And he would do it in real life. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4760.320000000001s)]
*  Like an idiot. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4762.88s)]
*  That was one of the dumbest things to do ever. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4763.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4766.160000000001s)]
*  He did do that with real guns multiple times. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4766.8s)]
*  But I kind of like the taunting now. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4770.0s)]
*  It's like I'm back now. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4772.08s)]
*  I'm lightened up. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4773.04s)]
*  I'm the bad guy. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4774.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of funny. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4775.04s)]
*  I kind of like the taunt. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4776.08s)]
*  If OJ goes back in the league, there's a stabbing celebration. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4777.200000000001s)]
*  You can't tell if people wouldn't go crazy far. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4779.68s)]
*  Oh, there we go. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4781.200000000001s)]
*  Berserk. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4782.4s)]

*  Wild, right? [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4788.08s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta lean into the character, I guess. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4788.639999999999s)]

*  But this ain't... [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4792.719999999999s)]
*  You gotta do the face turn at some point. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4794.639999999999s)]
*  Listen, it's the worst thing that he could possibly do. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4796.88s)]
*  I bought his sneakers, by the way. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4799.2s)]
*  Oh, while we're talking about sports, let's do our prize picks for the week, baby. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4800.8s)]
*  What you got? [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4804.32s)]
*  All right. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4805.36s)]
*  So I'm strategic these days. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4806.0s)]
*  I don't know if I like that. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4808.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4809.84s)]
*  It's not gut-syncing. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4810.4s)]
*  It's not thinking it made you all the money on Bitcoin. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4811.12s)]
*  I think you need gut. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4813.12s)]
*  All right, but I believe this, though. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4814.0s)]
*  I think I got this. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4815.5199999999995s)]
*  Miami is playing Buffalo. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4816.72s)]
*  Miami is very good at home. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4818.8s)]
*  They both need to fight for a playoff spot right now. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4821.5199999999995s)]
*  It's a big matchup. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4823.68s)]
*  But I got Devon A. Chain getting more yards. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4824.88s)]
*  I got Tua Tagovailoa, the quarterback, more. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4828.24s)]
*  I just don't believe in Buffalo and Miami's different team at home. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4830.96s)]
*  I also, Baker Mayfield is fighting for a playoff spot [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4833.76s)]
*  against the literal worst team in the league. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4836.64s)]
*  I got Baker Mayfield more. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4838.4s)]
*  And as a bonus, George Pickens, he's going to get more yards. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4840.0s)]
*  Pittsburgh, I think he's an underrated receiver. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4844.16s)]
*  I think they've been under projecting his yard, [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4846.24s)]
*  it's at like 56 and a half. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4847.6s)]
*  I think George Pickens more. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4848.88s)]
*  It's all mores. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4850.16s)]
*  I'm liking this. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4851.36s)]
*  I know you're saying it's not gut, but I think it is gut. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4852.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4855.76s)]

*  Time to get a little bit more in your pockets and let prize picks do it for you. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4885.84s)]
*  Now let's get back to the show. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4890.8s)]
*  I bought his sneakers, by the way. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4892.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah, you did. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4893.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, to play paddle. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4894.56s)]
*  Did you know John Moran came up with paddle sneakers? [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4896.080000000001s)]
*  No. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4898.080000000001s)]
*  Really? [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4898.400000000001s)]
*  No. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4898.8s)]
*  They're basketball, but I use them for paddle. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4900.160000000001s)]
*  Incredibly dynamic shoe. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4902.400000000001s)]
*  Toe box a little too tight. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4904.160000000001s)]
*  More than one time. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4905.6s)]
*  Threw them out. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4906.56s)]
*  I have to find my perfect paddle sneaker, is what I'm trying to say. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4908.96s)]
*  But I supported John Moran. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4913.280000000001s)]
*  Great endorsement for his shoe. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4914.64s)]
*  No, the shoe was fire, but the toe box is very tight. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4916.160000000001s)]
*  This guy's a Cinderella of paddle. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4918.88s)]
*  You know that, right? [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4920.56s)]
*  I need the perfect slipper. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4921.040000000001s)]
*  I need my perfect slipper. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4922.64s)]
*  I'm trying to get the Kobies. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4924.080000000001s)]
*  I think the Kobies might be great. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4925.12s)]
*  You know what my paddle shoe is going to be? [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4926.24s)]
*  The new D-Books. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4928.24s)]
*  Did you see the D-Books? [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4929.84s)]
*  The shatterback or the colorway that came out? [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4930.64s)]
*  Or they didn't even come out. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4933.12s)]
*  He wore them in the game. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4934.08s)]
*  But those will be my paddle shoe. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4935.04s)]
*  I need a little more cushion. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4937.599999999999s)]
*  Anyway, listen, I don't want to divert. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4938.48s)]
*  I don't want to talk about something that I'm incredibly passionate about, like paddle. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4940.5599999999995s)]
*  Those are fine. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4945.04s)]
*  For a basketball shoe, you got to compare it. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4947.2s)]
*  Imagine what LeBron's look like. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4949.36s)]
*  Imagine what, to me, it's the most normal looking basketball shoe out now. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4950.72s)]
*  Basketball shoes have gotten so wonky. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4954.72s)]
*  That I can agree on. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4956.4800000000005s)]
*  But I'm not looking at that like it's a street shoe I would wear. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4957.360000000001s)]
*  Not at all. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4960.08s)]
*  This is an athletic for a true sport like paddle. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4960.56s)]
*  Still the greatest basketball sneaker of all time, bro. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4965.04s)]
*  I cannot get enough of it. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4966.88s)]
*  I'm obsessed with these. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4968.16s)]
*  I miss basketball shoes that went up to the ankle. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4968.8s)]
*  These right here, bro? [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4971.92s)]
*  This is nasty work, bro. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4972.88s)]
*  Kobe changed that whole shit. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4973.92s)]
*  You know that? [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4975.12s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4976.16s)]
*  So Kobe was talking to soccer players and he's like, why don't they ever... [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4976.96s)]
*  You heard the story? [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4980.8s)]
*  And they're like, why don't they ever turn their ankle? [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4981.52s)]
*  I'm not going to say that. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4983.04s)]
*  Every basketball shoe was high top before that. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4984.24s)]
*  These were... [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4986.32s)]
*  This is the reason he left Adidas, I think. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4987.04s)]
*  These Kobe 2s, everybody hated. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4989.04s)]
*  I mean, Adidas dropped the ball. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4990.4800000000005s)]
*  Look how absolutely disgusting these sneakers are. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4991.76s)]
*  Doesn't look like you should pull the sneaker out of that. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4994.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4996.72s)]
*  It looks like a Cybertruck. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4998.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=4999.6s)]
*  That is awesome. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5000.56s)]
*  But yeah, basketball sneakers were always high top before that. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5002.0s)]
*  There was never a low top. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5004.56s)]
*  And then... [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5005.76s)]
*  And then the argument was that that little fabric up there [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5006.24s)]
*  isn't really going to do anything to protect your ankle. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5008.72s)]
*  Which is what we thought it was. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5010.72s)]
*  And I think it was just maybe that kind of mental security. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5012.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, like he was saying. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5015.92s)]
*  He was like, soccer players have low tops. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5016.96s)]
*  They never turn their ankle. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5018.64s)]
*  Now, there's reasons for that too. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5019.52s)]
*  It's like when they're pushing off of something, that thing also moves. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5020.8s)]
*  So the grass, the dirt can move if you're doing a really hard cut. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5024.8s)]
*  Whereas on basketball, once you reach the end of the sneaker, [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5028.4800000000005s)]
*  if you still need to push, there's only one thing that can happen. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5032.0s)]
*  And what happens a lot of times in basketball is you turn your ankle [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5035.04s)]
*  coming down on someone's foot. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5037.92s)]
*  In soccer, unless you're on the line jumping for something, [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5039.76s)]
*  there's not as much landing on feet. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5042.64s)]
*  This could have been sales at the time, just doing marketing. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5045.92s)]
*  But I remember Bill Simmons wrote an article back in the day. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5048.64s)]
*  And he was saying he talked to a guy at Nike that he was just cool with. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5051.6s)]
*  And they were like, [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5054.88s)]
*  Kobe worked with us so much to get a low top basketball sneaker. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5055.360000000001s)]
*  If he wasn't so obsessive about it, never would have worked. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5058.72s)]
*  And there's something on the side that comes out on low top basketball sneakers. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5062.320000000001s)]
*  And he was the guy that helped figure that out. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5065.92s)]
*  And that will protect from the roll. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5068.56s)]
*  Because what I realized was some running sneakers is if you do a hard stop [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5070.320000000001s)]
*  and running sneakers are made for going straight. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5075.04s)]
*  They're not made for side to side movements. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5077.68s)]
*  Basketball, you go on side to side. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5080.240000000001s)]
*  Somebody tries to cross you, step to defend. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5081.68s)]
*  If your sneaker can allow you to roll over, that's going to be what happens. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5084.160000000001s)]
*  So if you look at those early Kobes, the bottom of the sneaker would almost [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5087.84s)]
*  extend a little bit on the outside of the foot for that reason. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5092.72s)]
*  So you didn't just kind of roll over naturally like you would on some dunks or some shit. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5096.96s)]
*  You know what you need, honestly, probably tennis shoes. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5101.36s)]
*  So the problem with tennis shoes. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5104.24s)]
*  And I know that this is absolutely scintillating conversation that the [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5107.2s)]
*  flagrant asshole army absolutely loves because they're all obsessed with paddler should be. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5111.84s)]
*  God bless you all. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5116.0s)]
*  I hope you learn this and take this into your life. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5116.64s)]
*  I feel like it's a gift from the Lord and Savior for me to have this. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5119.36s)]
*  But tennis shoes have almost no padding on the bottom. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5123.200000000001s)]
*  And I wonder if this is part of being more explosive. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5128.72s)]
*  Like you want to be as close to the ground as possible. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5132.88s)]
*  Oh, I have a pair that don't look good, but I do think they're pretty bad. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5134.96s)]
*  They have a bubble? [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5138.56s)]
*  No bubble, but they're pretty bad. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5139.68s)]
*  So the ones that we have, I've been using like some Adidas ones or whatever, [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5141.04s)]
*  and it's just hard and very close to the ground. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5144.8s)]
*  My suspicion was with tennis, you need to be moving immediately. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5148.08s)]
*  You might not even have that split second for the cushion to absorb and then go. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5152.96s)]
*  Whereas basketball, there's so much jumping. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5157.92s)]
*  You want a little bit of cushion for your knees, a little bit of cushion for your ankles. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5159.84s)]
*  But they're kind of uncomfortable. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5165.44s)]
*  I don't like them. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5166.64s)]
*  There's two I would look into. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5167.76s)]
*  Rafael Nadal has a set of Nikes. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5168.88s)]
*  And then also I think Roger Federer, he owns part of that on running company. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5171.52s)]
*  And he played tennis in those. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5176.4s)]
*  I assume if they're running sneakers, they also should be padded. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5177.52s)]
*  He was with Nike too, right? [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5179.6s)]
*  He was with Nike then left because he got a piece of on and he made fucking crazy money. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5180.64s)]
*  Crazy money. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5184.080000000001s)]
*  But yeah, that might be one to look into whatever he played with. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5185.120000000001s)]
*  It's crazy to start a sneaker company. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5187.280000000001s)]
*  I feel like that's the hardest market to get into. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5189.120000000001s)]
*  Unbelievable lift. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5191.040000000001s)]
*  To any sneaker you mean? [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5192.64s)]
*  Like creating a sneaker company, I feel like is the hardest market to get into [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5193.92s)]
*  because for a sneaker company to gain our respect, especially men, it is next to impossible. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5197.92s)]
*  You gotta have a cool factor and if you can't break into that, your pay less shoes. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5207.52s)]
*  Literally, we just view you as pay less. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5213.120000000001s)]
*  If you're not attached to something, so obviously having Federer is a huge qualifier. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5215.4400000000005s)]
*  But I think there was that company Bird Dogs that got into the tech sector. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5219.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it popped off. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5223.68s)]
*  Hey Dudes, have you seen the Hey Dudes? [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5225.120000000001s)]
*  Man, are you fucking with me? [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5226.56s)]
*  No, this is a real company. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5227.84s)]
*  Hey Dudes are like- [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5229.52s)]
*  So sincere. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5230.160000000001s)]
*  No, you know there was a show called Hey Dude when we were gone. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5231.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5233.6s)]
*  What is that? [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5234.400000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah, it was on Nickelodeon. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5234.8s)]
*  Hey dude, let me suck your dick. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5236.08s)]
*  Hey dude, let me put you- [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5239.68s)]
*  Don't try to- [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5241.04s)]
*  Hey dude, don't try to fast talk over it. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5241.6s)]
*  He didn't want to get gassed. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5244.64s)]
*  Let me put your dick in my mouth. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5246.32s)]
*  That was crazy, that was crazy. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5247.52s)]
*  Hey dude, I'll put your dick in my ass. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5248.88s)]
*  That was crazy. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5250.32s)]
*  That was a good assist right there. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5250.96s)]
*  Hey bro, we out here. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5252.32s)]
*  Star boys. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5253.6s)]
*  But Hey Dudes are insanely popular styles. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5255.92s)]
*  Like I went back to Florida and everyone's wearing Hey Dudes, bro. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5258.24s)]
*  Everybody. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5261.12s)]
*  I feel like it's easier to make a lifestyle shoe versus like one that a [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5261.76s)]
*  $200 million athlete is going to risk rolling their feet like- [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5265.04s)]
*  These are just Wallabies. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5268.08s)]
*  The Bollerbrand explosive shoes. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5268.88s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5271.04s)]
*  100%. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5271.76s)]
*  Yeah, you can't take that risk. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5272.4s)]
*  They just bit off Wallabies. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5273.6s)]
*  Off Wallabies and Clarks. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5274.8s)]
*  These are horrible. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5275.92s)]
*  These are some of the ugliest shoes I ever bought. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5276.64s)]
*  But there's no sneaker culture in Florida. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5278.72s)]
*  Who bought the company? [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5280.48s)]
*  Crocs. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5281.36s)]
*  They wear sandals, they don't know anything. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5282.16s)]
*  But big Bollerbrand came really close until- [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5283.6s)]
*  Until their sneaker name worked. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5286.48s)]
*  If it worked, they might have had it. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5287.76s)]
*  But to enter athletic sneaker wear is so fucking hard. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5289.28s)]
*  What was the last one? [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5294.64s)]
*  Hoca is crazy. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5295.280000000001s)]
*  Hoca, hoca, hoca. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5296.72s)]
*  So here's the thing about running. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5298.72s)]
*  Running, people take so serious and is so specific that if you offer some sort of [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5301.360000000001s)]
*  technological advantage in the space- [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5306.08s)]
*  What is hoca? [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5307.84s)]
*  You've seen them. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5308.88s)]
*  They're like kind of- [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5309.4400000000005s)]
*  What's the technological- there's a fat ass- [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5310.08s)]
*  Yeah, just- [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5312.56s)]
*  It's literally just, I think, the cushion of the soul and tricks people into believing [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5313.04s)]
*  that this is going to be easier on your knees for long distance running. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5316.72s)]
*  They also have zero drop. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5319.92s)]
*  They also have like rounded- [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5320.88s)]
*  What's zero drop mean? [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5322.0s)]
*  Zero drop is the drop between- [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5323.04s)]
*  Zero drop is- [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5325.6s)]
*  No. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5327.5199999999995s)]
*  Zero drop these balls in your mouth. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5328.56s)]
*  It's just the distance, like the millimeters between your heel and your front of your foot. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5331.6s)]
*  Oh, so it doesn't tilt down in any way. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5336.48s)]
*  It doesn't tilt down in any way. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5338.72s)]
*  They're just like some teched out running shoes. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5339.5199999999995s)]
*  Because people spend so much time running and take it so seriously, that can work. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5341.68s)]
*  The on shit became like a casual shoe. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5344.88s)]
*  They also did some sports shit. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5348.32s)]
*  But to get into the sneaker market, we are so, what is it called, prejudiced to any new brand. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5350.0s)]
*  Because cool is such a factor. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5357.28s)]

*  They had it. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5364.08s)]
*  And it's hard to be a cool and athletic sneaker. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5364.72s)]
*  And they were rivaling fucking Adidas, Reebok, and Nike in the basketball sector before that [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5368.16s)]
*  shit fell apart. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5374.08s)]

*  Corp Corp. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5382.96s)]

*  Yeah, they look like climbing shoes. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5394.32s)]
*  Those didn't have any cool associated with them. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5395.92s)]
*  I think what basically happened was is that like, cool sneakers, the rejection of [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5397.6s)]
*  cool sneakers, dunks or an Air Force One or whatever like that- [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5403.6s)]
*  New Balance. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5408.08s)]
*  Yeah, is almost dad sneakers or exercise sneakers. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5409.12s)]
*  And these start to become really popular as fashion rejected the quote unquote traditional [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5412.8s)]
*  cool. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5418.24s)]
*  Because that's like you would only see on a suburban dad going for a hike. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5419.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5422.4s)]

*  Oh, Tucker Carlson beefing with Ben Shapiro. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5671.76s)]
*  What y'all think about it? [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5674.24s)]
*  Explain to me your fascination with Tucker. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5678.639999999999s)]
*  I think that was a loaded question. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5681.84s)]
*  No, because you said I find him interesting. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5683.679999999999s)]
*  I do find him interesting. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5686.08s)]
*  Tell me why. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5687.679999999999s)]
*  I think he's making a really smart play right now. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5688.719999999999s)]
*  Which is? [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5691.679999999999s)]
*  I think he smells blood in the water with Ben. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5692.4s)]
*  So again, I think that Tucker and Ben Shapiro and other groups as well [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5696.96s)]
*  are fighting for the same group of people, right? [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5703.36s)]
*  Let's say, let's be the most generous and say middle to the right Americans. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5707.92s)]
*  And Tucker knows that the daily wire is the largest independent version of those people. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5714.08s)]
*  Or the largest independent system that is satisfying those people. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5722.24s)]
*  And those people are conflicted about Israel-Palestine. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5726.32s)]
*  Ben Shapiro has got to lock in or maybe he really wants to lock in, but y'all I'm riding so hard. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5730.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm making every single new story about this. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5735.599999999999s)]
*  We're going, we have to talk for our people. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5737.84s)]
*  We gotta speak for our people, etc. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5739.759999999999s)]
*  And I think Tucker is in a position where he's like, I'm gonna use this. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5741.68s)]
*  He already sees the fan base being segregated on this or separated or whatever the fuck word, [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5745.12s)]
*  I'm trying to, fractured. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5749.36s)]
*  Daily wire's fan base on it. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5751.599999999999s)]
*  So he's like, I'm gonna use this as an opportunity to scoop up all those people [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5753.2s)]
*  that aren't exactly into the reporting that Ben is doing. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5757.68s)]
*  So I think that this is a right wing news play. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5761.76s)]
*  And now that Tucker's in the space, he's like, let me gobble up some stuff and let me see what I can do. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5764.88s)]
*  Now he's in the independent space. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5769.52s)]
*  And his position on that specifically is like, [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5771.68s)]
*  I'm not emotionally invested in either side. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5774.32s)]
*  I care about America. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5776.56s)]
*  Well, the thing that's really interesting is exactly. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5777.6s)]
*  It's like, what's up? [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5780.32s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5782.32s)]
*  So the thing that's really interesting about his positioning is he's framing Ben [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5782.8s)]
*  as if he doesn't care about America by caring about Israel. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5788.88s)]
*  By caring about either side. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5794.08s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5797.2s)]
*  Now, I don't think that we exist in America as people that can only care about one thing. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5797.92s)]
*  I think it's an unfair framing. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5804.08s)]
*  I think that you can be an American and Palestinian and care about what's happening in Palestine. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5805.68s)]
*  I think you can get American and Jew and care about what's happening in Israel. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5809.28s)]
*  I think you can get American and Indian and care about what's happening in fucking India. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5812.0s)]
*  You can care about these things and you can utilize whatever platform you want [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5814.8s)]
*  to support the things you care about. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5818.72s)]
*  I think it's one of the most beautiful things about America is that we bring our culture. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5820.4s)]
*  We live in a free society where we can bring our past cultures and celebrate them here. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5825.76s)]
*  You can't do that everywhere. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5829.280000000001s)]
*  You can't go around celebrating your past cultures someplace because they shut the [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5830.72s)]
*  fuck up. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5833.52s)]
*  We just do this. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5833.84s)]
*  Now Tucker said something. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5834.8s)]
*  My family's been here for hundreds of years and it's like, okay, yeah, well, [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5835.84s)]
*  if you have no attachment to where you're from and where you're from, [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5838.400000000001s)]
*  of course you love America. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5841.360000000001s)]
*  That's all you have to love. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5842.320000000001s)]
*  You don't know what you are. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5843.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5844.72s)]
*  You don't know if you're from Prussia or you're from Sweden or from Norway. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5845.280000000001s)]
*  If you did, maybe you would feel compelled to speak on them as well. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5848.4800000000005s)]
*  Even that is a branding thing though is like I'm American. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5851.68s)]
*  I'm so American. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5853.68s)]
*  I'm so far removed from all that stuff. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5854.64s)]
*  I just can only be American. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5856.400000000001s)]
*  That's all. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5857.52s)]
*  I can't have the capacity to care. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5858.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5859.76s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5860.320000000001s)]
*  But yeah, I don't like that framing where we can only care about the things here. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5860.72s)]
*  And also to imply that if we cared about things in other places, it would take away from the [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5864.8s)]
*  opioid epidemic here. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5870.72s)]
*  It almost felt a little bit like he was using the opioid crisis as a tool, which I don't like [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5872.240000000001s)]
*  because it's like Tucker, you're interviewing the wolf of Wall Street. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5878.8s)]
*  What you doing for the opioid crisis? [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5883.839999999999s)]
*  You're interviewing Obama's gay lover. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5885.36s)]
*  Yeah, you had Obama's opioid using gay lover on the pod. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5887.759999999999s)]
*  So stop acting. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5892.0s)]
*  Now you're talking. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5894.639999999999s)]
*  So it's like, so I don't know, and maybe he has a lot of charity work that he's doing [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5896.96s)]
*  for him. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5900.719999999999s)]
*  Maybe he's donating money from those podcasts to this crisis. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5900.96s)]
*  But the idea that he would be critical of somebody else using their platform for the [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5904.4s)]
*  things they cared about while he's using his platform for his own interests, I think is [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5909.44s)]
*  a bit hypocritical. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5914.0s)]
*  Now, he's a sharp dude. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5915.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5917.44s)]
*  Tucker's a sharp dude, and he's been through the fucking wringer. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5918.0s)]
*  They came to his house. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5921.44s)]
*  By they, I mean people who hated him, protested against it. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5922.799999999999s)]
*  They showed up at his house with his fucking children. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5925.839999999999s)]
*  So he's already had mud thrown all over him, and he's survived and continued to thrive. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5927.759999999999s)]
*  That's a dangerous man. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5934.0s)]
*  You don't wanna fuck with a man like that. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5936.0s)]
*  Because most people have not experienced the worst of the worst, meaning what the public [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5937.84s)]
*  can do to you. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5942.64s)]
*  Once you've experienced it and you know that you can get past it, bring it on. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5943.84s)]
*  Bring it the fuck on. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5950.4800000000005s)]
*  Now, Ben has also been through that. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5951.76s)]
*  Ben has been the most hated person on the internet because that was his, before he became [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5953.6s)]
*  a real journalist, he was just a troll that was trying to piss black people off every [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5957.68s)]
*  single day. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5961.52s)]
*  So he's also experienced the ire of the internet. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5962.32s)]
*  Now he's tried to reshape his image and been like, why can't we all get along? [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5965.28s)]
*  Even though he spent the majority of his fucking professional life trying to divide as much [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5968.8s)]
*  as he possibly could. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5973.5199999999995s)]
*  But he's making that pivot. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5975.759999999999s)]
*  So seeing them go after it for the same audience would be quite interesting. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5977.12s)]
*  I love it. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5981.44s)]
*  No, dude, white on white crime. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5982.4s)]
*  Yeah, that was his love. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5984.32s)]
*  But I wonder if there's other players that are gonna come in too. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5987.679999999999s)]
*  I wonder if, because Daily Wire was the only- [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5990.5599999999995s)]
*  And now there's gonna be some people that are going, why is there so much attention [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=5995.68s)]
*  to this thing that's happening in the place? [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6001.2s)]
*  Listen, we live in New York, in Los Angeles, maybe Miami. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6002.48s)]
*  There's gonna be a hyper focus on what's happening in the Middle East because there are so many [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6007.92s)]
*  people from there. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6012.4s)]
*  We're talking about Palestinians and Jews in these cities, right? [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6013.44s)]
*  We were talking to Derek the other day. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6018.64s)]
*  We're like, yo, is everybody talking about the Middle East and what's going on in the [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6020.32s)]
*  Middle East? [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6023.2s)]
*  He goes, bro, we haven't had one conversation about it at the club. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6023.6s)]
*  One. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6027.360000000001s)]
*  Now, I don't know if that's all Texas, but if they're not even talking about it amongst [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6029.120000000001s)]
*  friends, it's not even being brought up, not off pod, it might not be a concern to the [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6033.6s)]
*  majority of the country. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6039.4400000000005s)]
*  And if it's not a concern to the majority of the country and you're Ben and you're talking [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6040.4800000000005s)]
*  about it every single day because it's something you're passionate about, your audience might [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6044.0s)]
*  start to get to go, whoa. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6046.96s)]
*  Fatigued at the very least. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6048.88s)]
*  Was it Ben also beefing with Candace? [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6050.16s)]
*  Candace as well. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6053.68s)]
*  He can't fire her because he's all free speech. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6056.24s)]
*  So Candace got him by the balls. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6058.72s)]
*  It's like, you're gonna silence me? [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6060.5599999999995s)]
*  I thought you're the platform that was erected because we were being silenced. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6061.84s)]
*  Now the second I disagree with you, you shut me down? [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6066.48s)]
*  Yep. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6069.44s)]
*  Heavy is the head, y'all. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6070.32s)]
*  It is. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6073.36s)]
*  Heavy is the head. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6073.92s)]
*  But I do think that there is a little jockeying going down and especially with this election, [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6075.12s)]
*  you're gonna see them start to pick sides and who they're partnering with. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6079.04s)]
*  Now Tucker, it seems he's cozied up with Trump and they beefed. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6081.84s)]
*  Didn't Tucker shit all over Trump? [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6085.44s)]
*  Now they hang out at the fight. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6086.88s)]
*  This is where I kind of find so disingenuous is like, we know for a fact you were on Fox [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6088.24s)]
*  News praising Trump every day and then texting behind his back or texting off air, I hate [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6093.92s)]
*  this guy, he sucks, he's the worst in America, whatever you were saying. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6100.08s)]
*  You're just doing the same. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6103.12s)]
*  How do people not see through it? [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6104.24s)]
*  There's certain people- [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6105.36s)]
*  And didn't he on air criticize too? [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6106.16s)]
*  Wasn't he very critical? [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6107.92s)]
*  Maybe very early, but as soon as it looked like Trump was winning, all of a sudden pro [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6108.72s)]
*  Trump support everything Trump does, he's not at fall for Jan six at all. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6112.0s)]
*  But that's the Fox institution. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6116.24s)]
*  That's the Fox institution. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6117.4400000000005s)]
*  I would have conversations with those dudes off air and they would tell me all they'd [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6118.4800000000005s)]
*  be talking shit with, talking shit about Trump and then the second that fucking camera came [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6121.76s)]
*  on and that green, sorry, that red light popped on, it was just a dick ride marathon. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6126.96s)]
*  But now you're independent, so I was like, all right, look, I can judge him for saying [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6132.24s)]
*  things he didn't believe to get a check, but we're all hypocritical to a degree, whatever. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6137.6s)]
*  What I'm saying now though is now you're independent, you're just doing the same thing. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6141.52s)]
*  You're independent now, you could go do whatever you want to. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6144.88s)]
*  There's no boss, you're on your own and you're just doing the same thing. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6146.8s)]
*  Freedom of speech. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6149.52s)]
*  But it's not free speech, it's speech that makes money. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6151.52s)]
*  Of course, of course, but you can say whatever you want. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6153.76s)]
*  I'm not as mad at him as I am curious. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6156.4800000000005s)]
*  The people who bought in again, the people who keep buying into Ted Cruz as being some [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6158.88s)]
*  authentic whatever. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6163.04s)]
*  There's just example after example of these guys being disingenuous. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6164.48s)]
*  Ben Shapiro, that motherfucker, I believe he believes everything he's saying, [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6168.799999999999s)]
*  whether I agree or not. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6172.959999999999s)]
*  What I hear from him, what comes to me seems that genuinely, he seems to genuinely, [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6174.639999999999s)]
*  Israel, Palestine, talks about Israel a lot, I believe he believes everything he's saying. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6181.12s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think that, yeah, the only thing I would say he's disingenuous about is wanting [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6184.799999999999s)]
*  there to be one of the country to come together and be part of what I think that he cares [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6190.4s)]
*  more about monetizing his base than he does the whole country coming together. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6197.36s)]
*  Fair enough. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6201.839999999999s)]
*  Because if the whole country comes together, he can't make movies that are poking fun at [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6203.04s)]
*  the left. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6208.24s)]
*  He's monetizing the ire of the right towards the left. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6209.44s)]
*  That's where I guess what I'm doing isn't necessarily fair because again, [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6212.48s)]
*  I think there are levels of hypocrisy to every human being. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6214.879999999999s)]
*  Just to me, it's a little worse in some cases. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6217.759999999999s)]
*  I think the further, the farther end of the spectrum further, I guess, is Tucker, Ted Cruz, [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6219.68s)]
*  probably AOC or whoever on the left. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6225.52s)]
*  I'm sure there's people on the left, but like, how do you just- [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6227.12s)]
*  I'm sure Tucker would say to this though, like, yeah, I disagree with him, but I agree with him [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6230.400000000001s)]
*  and I want him for president even though- [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6234.8s)]
*  But you shit on him in private text and public facing, front facing, always praised him. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6237.04s)]
*  Now you're doing the exact same thing and I don't even know if he's really addressed. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6243.200000000001s)]
*  I used to hate him. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6246.96s)]
*  Here's where he won me back over. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6247.84s)]
*  I didn't see this. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6250.320000000001s)]
*  I just Googled it and he was just like, yeah, they raided Mar-a-Lago. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6251.04s)]
*  That's fucked up. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6253.68s)]
*  I don't like, there's things that I disagree with, but I'd still be a Trump supporter because you [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6254.64s)]
*  can't do that. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6258.400000000001s)]
*  It's bigger than Trump. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6259.68s)]
*  It's bigger than Biden. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6260.400000000001s)]
*  I want to live in a free country with a functioning justice system. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6261.280000000001s)]
*  So I'm sure he just takes it on political ground. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6263.52s)]
*  It's the same way where like- [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6265.6s)]
*  People hate Biden. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6267.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. It's also like a single issue voter. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6268.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6270.88s)]
*  So I think that Tucker is supporting who he thinks will [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6271.200000000001s)]
*  protect the values, the American values that he cares about. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6275.52s)]
*  And if it looks like the Trump administration is going to do that better than Biden or better [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6281.12s)]
*  than DeSantis or better than anybody else, he's like, okay, I'm going to ride with this. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6285.84s)]
*  Even though there are things that I really don't like, this is paramount. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6288.88s)]
*  Which I agree on its face is kind of hypocritical, but if you get into the nuance of it- [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6292.64s)]
*  I just find- [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6296.08s)]
*  Also, that's what most people are. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6296.4800000000005s)]
*  For example, like if you're a Jewish person in America and it looks like the right wing, [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6298.08s)]
*  a part of the American government is more supportive of Israel in this war, [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6303.04s)]
*  you might vote Republican easily. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6308.08s)]
*  Like for example, I'm sure if there was something with India, [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6310.48s)]
*  if only the Democrats were supporting India throughout this thing that you really cared about, [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6313.92s)]
*  you would at least be open to it. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6318.16s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, for sure. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6320.08s)]
*  I guess my general feeling, and what you're saying isn't wrong, [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6321.36s)]
*  but my general feeling on him is it seems a little fraudulent to me and it seems more fraudulent [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6325.44s)]
*  than a lot of these guys. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6331.68s)]
*  Like it just seems a little more desperate when you're bringing on Obama's alleged gay [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6333.52s)]
*  lover who did like- [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6337.12s)]
*  No, that was fire. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6338.56s)]
*  It's fire, it's fun. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6339.360000000001s)]
*  But if you're a serious journalist, it's a wild for me to be like, yo, you're a serious journalist. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6340.96s)]
*  That was fun. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6345.200000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's important information. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6345.76s)]
*  If somebody said they sucked the president's dick, you want to talk to them? [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6347.04s)]
*  No. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6350.88s)]
*  Why are you sucking that thing so hard, Ray, when you said that, bro? [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6351.280000000001s)]
*  That black feeling, bro. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6353.84s)]
*  If my brother wants to come out here, I would- [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6355.12s)]
*  I would absolutely want to- [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6356.96s)]
*  But she did it for a fact. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6357.84s)]
*  It's been proven. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6359.360000000001s)]
*  I want to hear what she has to say. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6360.24s)]
*  Anybody could say I sucked the president's dick. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6361.679999999999s)]
*  So probably a lot of people saying it. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6364.88s)]
*  A drug-using dude, like, all right, there's no real evidence to support anything you're saying. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6366.719999999999s)]
*  I hear you. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6371.599999999999s)]
*  One hour interview. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6372.08s)]
*  I hear you. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6372.88s)]
*  You have higher standards for Tucker than he has for himself. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6373.5199999999995s)]
*  And that's frustrating for you. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6376.88s)]
*  Yes. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6378.4s)]
*  And I feel like we as a people don't really- [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6378.8s)]
*  If a guy says one thing we believe in wholeheartedly, and I'll probably do the same shit. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6382.08s)]
*  I'm not- [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6385.84s)]
*  Who am I to act like I'm so pious? [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6386.48s)]
*  I'm looking at it objectively because I don't care too much about this. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6388.96s)]
*  And I'm like, ehh, it just feels a little gross to me what you're doing. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6391.84s)]
*  I can see that. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6395.04s)]
*  Maybe he's got an angle he's playing. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6397.36s)]
*  I didn't think about that Ben Shapiro shit, but that's a brilliant angle to just take market share. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6399.68s)]
*  That's what this is- [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6404.48s)]
*  I mean, he came up in the Fox system, he's not a stupid guy, so he knows how they do business. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6405.28s)]
*  He knows the political chess moves that are at play. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6409.12s)]
*  And I'm sure that he's applying them to what he's doing. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6412.8s)]
*  Where does his show live? [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6416.56s)]
*  Is it just- [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6418.160000000001s)]
*  X, I think. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6418.64s)]
*  He only does X or is it like a private website or- [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6419.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but he said, I saw him do this in an interview, he's gonna have advertisers, [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6422.320000000001s)]
*  but also keep the subscriber model because he knows at any moment he can lose the advertisers. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6426.96s)]
*  Yeah, it makes sense, that's why we got the Patreon. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6433.52s)]
*  And he also thinks like a lot from the substack community will come up in that independent- [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6435.360000000001s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't start a version of the Daily Wire. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6440.32s)]
*  Yeah, maybe that's what he's angling for right now. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6446.719999999999s)]
*  Exactly, and I think that he's positioning Ben, he's framing Ben as if Ben doesn't care about America. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6448.88s)]
*  And the people that he wants on his side are the people that care about America in the way that he [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6456.4s)]
*  wants it to be or that he believes they want it to be. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6463.2s)]
*  That's an unserved demographic. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6466.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I'll give him best case scenario, which is that's the thing that he has in common. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6468.32s)]
*  He wants somebody that will literally put America first, cares about American issues, [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6472.16s)]
*  is gonna try to fix American issues and not go fight these senseless wars abroad. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6476.16s)]
*  First American news. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6480.5599999999995s)]
*  Something like that. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6482.5599999999995s)]
*  So that's my assumption and that he would maybe collect some talent around him, [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6483.28s)]
*  partner up with one of these billionaire, Peter Thiel types, get a bunch of money, [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6487.76s)]
*  create another Daily Wire and now Daily Wire has got some competition. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6492.719999999999s)]
*  There you go. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6496.96s)]
*  I think that should probably be the move, but he's slow playing it, smart. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6498.0s)]
*  He's not just jumping into it, it's like, okay, let me build up this podcast and he's doing a good job. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6501.679999999999s)]
*  People are fucking watching. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6505.12s)]
*  He's got some interviews that are going viral. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6506.879999999999s)]
*  So each one of these episodes is doing millions of views. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6510.0s)]
*  Yeah, like this one from December 28, 31 million views. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6513.679999999999s)]
*  Granted, it's probably inflated on Twitter numbers are. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6516.48s)]
*  Yeah, but it's like insane engagement. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6519.2s)]
*  You saw Elon asked Mr. Beast to post on X. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6521.36s)]
*  Yeah, then this is like, nah. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6524.08s)]
*  Yeah, he's got the network is called the Tucker Carlson Network and he has eight different [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6526.8s)]
*  verticals when they're in there or like shows like he has his tour, the sworn enemy tour. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6531.6s)]
*  He's got like the cabin interviews that he does so he can be suited up, political interviewer, Tucker. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6535.2s)]
*  Tucker's sharp. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6543.12s)]
*  He's well read. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6544.08s)]
*  He likes zens, that's cool. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6545.52s)]
*  He's into the zen. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6547.04s)]
*  Now the, yeah, the Mr. Beast. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6549.2s)]
*  Can I see what he said? [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6552.4s)]
*  Oh, the Mr. Beast thing? [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6554.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6554.88s)]
*  Basically, he was like, I uploaded go to watch it. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6555.92s)]
*  I'll drop kick you. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6558.72s)]
*  And then someone was like, upload on this platform to Elon says, yeah. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6559.76s)]
*  And then he says, my videos cost millions to make. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6563.120000000001s)]
*  And even if they got a billion views on X, it wouldn't fund a fraction of it. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6565.280000000001s)]
*  Which I mean, YouTube pays the most. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6571.200000000001s)]
*  It seems like of this type of content. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6573.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6574.72s)]
*  So. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6575.92s)]
*  Damn. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6577.92s)]
*  I mean, yeah, if if Twitter's not paying any ad revenue, can he do it? [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6578.56s)]
*  I said I'm down though to test stuff once monetization is really cranking. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6582.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6585.92s)]
*  Yeah, but he needs to make money. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6586.320000000001s)]
*  I think what he's thinking is if I post it on Twitter, it's going to take away from my [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6587.4400000000005s)]
*  views on YouTube, which generate revenue. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6590.4800000000005s)]
*  So I'm losing money to promote your platform. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6592.88s)]
*  Now, what Elon should be doing is going, here's the check. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6594.88s)]
*  We're going to pay you more than you would make on YouTube to just also post here. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6599.4400000000005s)]
*  Because that hurts because he's also got Twitter blue, which is where they're [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6604.320000000001s)]
*  they're advertising people are making so much on Twitter using Twitter blue. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6607.52s)]
*  And then if Mr. Beast is like, no, I'm not. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6610.88s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6613.36s)]
*  Then I'm like, oh, maybe I don't need this fucking blue check. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6613.84s)]
*  I was thinking about getting it and I might still do it. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6618.0s)]
*  But whenever the special comes out, I was like, maybe I'll put it on Twitter, [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6620.0s)]
*  get the blue and monetize this too. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6622.48s)]
*  And now I'm looking at it like, oh, you don't make that much. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6623.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6626.24s)]
*  Maybe it's a bad move. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6626.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6627.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they got to figure out just how to like get actual money off these views, [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6628.8s)]
*  which is the biggest challenge for all these platforms, like short form views specifically. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6633.2s)]
*  How do you really make money off? [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6636.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6637.92s)]
*  It's just tough. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6638.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6639.44s)]
*  I mean, what the advantage that TikTok has is that you get lost in that scroll [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6640.16s)]
*  so they can throw an ad as the fifth swipe up. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6646.16s)]
*  Twitter is a little different in that your scroll is the feed. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6650.5599999999995s)]
*  It's kind of an antiquated model where it's like you're just being [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6654.08s)]
*  almost force fed these things that and most of the stuff on your feed is people you follow. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6660.08s)]
*  But I think they also throw other things they think you'll like. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6663.76s)]
*  But TikTok is the genius. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6666.5599999999995s)]
*  We know what you like. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6668.56s)]
*  You don't got to tell us. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6669.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6670.88s)]
*  And we're going to feed it to you. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6671.360000000001s)]
*  It's a full swipe. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6672.0s)]
*  I can't do one swipe and get go past 10 tweets. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6672.72s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6675.52s)]
*  You know what else that tweet makes it feel like is, oh, y'all can't afford to pay? [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6676.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6680.88s)]
*  Y'all can't afford to pay. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6681.04s)]
*  You're still broke. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6682.56s)]
*  Yeah, maybe. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6684.4800000000005s)]
*  Did you see the Cybertruck ad, quote unquote? [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6686.24s)]
*  That was great. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6689.280000000001s)]
*  Did you see this? [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6690.4800000000005s)]
*  Basically, this went viral. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6691.280000000001s)]
*  It was like, you know, Cybertruck got in its first accident. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6692.400000000001s)]
*  Here's what happened. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6694.96s)]
*  And this is the picture of the Cybertruck. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6695.76s)]
*  Fantastic. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6697.28s)]
*  This is the picture of the Corolla that it hit. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6698.24s)]
*  Absolutely fantastic. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6700.32s)]
*  I don't know if it's really an ad, but this shit feels like it just looks so good for [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6702.88s)]
*  the Cybertruck. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6707.04s)]
*  It's an amazing ad, if it is. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6707.759999999999s)]
*  Now, here's the question. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6709.759999999999s)]
*  Do we have the list? [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6710.8s)]
*  Do we have fucking Epstein's list yet? [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6714.4s)]
*  Let me just find that. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6716.16s)]
*  How do we not have Epstein's list? [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6716.8s)]
*  I'm starting to really think this is going to be so underwhelming. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6718.08s)]
*  It is. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6720.88s)]
*  No list yet. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6722.32s)]
*  No fucking list. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6723.5199999999995s)]
*  What do we think about this Tasha Kay Kevin Hart thing? [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6728.24s)]
*  I mean, she's been sued, like left and right. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6733.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, she's been sued a few times. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6735.44s)]
*  For defamation. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6737.28s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't know who she was. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6738.96s)]
*  I had heard the name, but I was watching her videos yesterday when the story... [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6740.96s)]
*  But this is extortion she's suing him for. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6744.08s)]
*  So defamation was Cardi B. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6747.36s)]
*  This one is she was literally, allegedly trying to extort Kevin Hart with his assistant. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6749.44s)]

*  And it's like, that's a crime. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6759.04s)]
*  Talking shit about somebody or saying something is podcasting. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6761.6s)]
*  Now, once these lawsuits start getting thrown out, it might change podcasting. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6767.04s)]
*  We might have to throw a lot more allegedlys out. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6770.56s)]

*  Right? [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6782.64s)]
*  But then the thing that's confusing to me, why sue? [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6783.2s)]
*  Why not just go after her criminally? [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6785.4400000000005s)]
*  Have the feds go after her? [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6789.12s)]

*  So I'm not sure. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6796.0s)]
*  I mean, the way that I think you really hurt people, I guess, is financially. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6797.04s)]
*  I'm going to make it so that you can't even do this shit anymore. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6802.32s)]
*  But at the same time, yeah, you should do criminals. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6806.08s)]
*  Put it in jail. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6808.32s)]

*  Take kids from orphanages. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6946.34s)]
*  Because they can't have many of them. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=6948.1s)]

*  This is a well-known thing. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7044.2s)]
*  Yeah, but why there was other posts with just little kids? [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7045.48s)]
*  Because they're famous. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7048.28s)]
*  Yeah, I'm assuming they're just like- [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7049.88s)]
*  People with their kids, Bollywood actors. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7050.92s)]
*  Oh, I thought we were just looking at bitches. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7052.36s)]

*  That's AI. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7079.48s)]
*  Oh, step. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7081.08s)]
*  Look at that one right there. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7081.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7082.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7083.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7084.44s)]
*  Yo, shut up, shut up. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7089.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7090.12s)]
*  Yo, look at these hot-ass Indians. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7091.24s)]
*  Son, that look like Dub and Dove. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7093.0s)]
*  Dub and Dover? [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7096.12s)]
*  Dove wishes he was like either one of them. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7096.76s)]
*  Oh, God damn, look at them abs. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7099.0s)]
*  That's AI. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7100.6s)]
*  Yeah, you can say that if you want to. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7102.04s)]
*  I mean, Akash, let's be serious here. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7104.36s)]
*  You don't genuinely believe that. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7106.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7108.52s)]
*  That's actually too many abs to be attractive to me, [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7108.84s)]
*  but that's too much abs, but that's real. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7111.64s)]
*  It ain't. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7114.12s)]
*  Thousand percent real. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7115.24s)]
*  No, thousand percent. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7116.28s)]
*  One thousand. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7119.0s)]
*  Okay, so. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7120.36s)]
*  So, in all seriousness, guys, [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7121.32s)]
*  what do we think about Colorado and Maine trying to ban Trump from the ballot box? [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7125.639999999999s)]
*  It's kind of funny, like some of the people that are coming out in opposition to it. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7129.96s)]
*  Talk to me. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7134.68s)]
*  So I don't think Maine- [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7135.24s)]
*  Newsome. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7136.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7137.0s)]
*  There's been a couple Democrats, actually, that are like- [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7137.88s)]
*  So I think Maine specifically, I don't know if Colorado is the same thing. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7140.2s)]
*  I think I just read it from Maine, that basically you can't run if you support an insurrection. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7142.599999999999s)]
*  There is a- [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7146.76s)]
*  Yeah, they're going off of- [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7147.72s)]
*  Like a post-Civil War law or something. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7149.72s)]
*  Yeah, there's a 14th Amendment, there's a clause or something like that that says, [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7151.88s)]
*  if you support insurrection, I think it can give cause to remove your eligibility for something. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7155.320000000001s)]
*  It doesn't specifically say president, but it's your eligibility for election. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7163.72s)]
*  I'm not exactly sure. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7167.96s)]
*  Office, I thought, yeah. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7168.92s)]
*  Office, yes. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7169.4800000000005s)]
*  So they're using that clause to remove him from the ballot. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7170.68s)]
*  Right. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7174.2s)]
*  Now, the question is, one, will the Supreme Court let this live? [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7174.76s)]
*  I doubt it. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7180.12s)]
*  No, zero chance. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7181.08s)]
*  The fact that they've already tried is just gonna bolster support for Trump. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7182.2s)]
*  100%. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7186.2s)]
*  This is the best possible thing they've had. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7186.6s)]
*  It's so dumb. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7187.8s)]
*  I heard he's trying to get around it by holding a caucus, [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7188.52s)]
*  because then if you hold a caucus, there's no ballot, and you can get around it. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7191.88s)]
*  The Republicans do caucus. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7198.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7199.4800000000005s)]
*  Also, has he- [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7200.04s)]
*  It depends on the state. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7200.52s)]
*  Has he been convicted? [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7201.4800000000005s)]
*  If they switch this, then they just get around it. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7202.4400000000005s)]
*  You don't need to be convicted. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7204.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7206.52s)]
*  So what is the judgment on whether or not you supported it? [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7206.92s)]
*  It was- [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7210.2s)]
*  If you have reasonable- [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7210.68s)]
*  Self-executing. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7211.8s)]
*  I think that's like its own trial. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7213.56s)]
*  I assume in my brain, they're finding you guilty. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7215.400000000001s)]
*  They're finding you guilty of supporting an insurrection. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7217.400000000001s)]
*  So whatever the federal court or whatever state of New York says, [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7220.04s)]
*  in our eyes, for this law, you support an insurrection. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7223.0s)]
*  So the punishment is, for this is not jail time, it is you cannot run for it. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7225.64s)]
*  That's the judge's discretion. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7228.68s)]
*  Yeah, I guess- [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7229.64s)]
*  Call it our Supreme Court. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7230.4400000000005s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7231.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7232.4400000000005s)]
*  Gotcha. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7233.0s)]
*  There you go. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7233.08s)]
*  Here's the question here. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7234.280000000001s)]
*  Now, is this an organized, I think about this in two ways. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7235.32s)]
*  Is this an organized attempt to remove Trump from the election by the people in power, [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7241.4s)]
*  the theys, if you will, right? [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7248.84s)]
*  They cannot possibly be this dumb. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7250.84s)]
*  Or, is this local, not authorities, but local politicians trying to satisfy their constituents [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7252.679999999999s)]
*  by being the person that tried to get Trump taken off because I hate Trump so much and [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7265.08s)]
*  I hate Trumpism. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7271.320000000001s)]
*  And that's what I'm gonna do for you guys. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7272.52s)]
*  I'm gonna fight back against Trumpism. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7274.360000000001s)]
*  And then it manifests itself in this plan organized by the DNC to remove him as competition. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7276.52s)]
*  See what I'm saying? [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7283.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7285.320000000001s)]
*  I think my knee-jerk reaction is like, oh, here goes the DNC fucking it up again, or [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7286.120000000001s)]
*  here goes the the theys, the Democratic theys, the liberal theys. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7289.8s)]
*  They're gonna fuck this up and they're gonna send Trump right to the White House with this [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7292.68s)]
*  organized plan to remove him from the ballots cuz they don't think they can beat him. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7295.96s)]
*  But I wonder if it's not that sophisticated. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7299.0s)]
*  It's just at a local level, you're just trying to satisfy your base. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7301.320000000001s)]
*  And what is better for a liberal base than just going, hey, we're gonna get Trump off [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7304.76s)]
*  the ballot because this guy started an insurrection. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7309.56s)]
*  What's weird is it's also on the ballot in conservative states, Texas for sure. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7312.200000000001s)]
*  It's on the, like it's not on the ballot, they're mulling the same thing. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7316.52s)]
*  Well, I think there's Democrats that can put it on there, right? [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7319.96s)]
*  I guess so, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7322.2s)]
*  And then you tell your fan base or your voting base, I did it. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7323.16s)]
*  I put it on there. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7325.4800000000005s)]
*  Do you want the actual answer? [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7325.64s)]
*  Yes, sure. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7327.0s)]
*  It's separate, just unorganized litigants and they're choosing different arguments [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7327.56s)]
*  to argue this point. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7335.16s)]
*  So one, Michigan had one argument, Colorado had another argument, and Maine was the Secretary [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7336.68s)]
*  of State who basically because of Colorado Supreme Court agreeing with the lower court [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7342.52s)]
*  that he was an insurrectionist, she couldn't in her mind say, oh, this is, [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7347.72s)]
*  she had to uphold the constitution in her mind because it says 14th Amendment, [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7357.240000000001s)]
*  if you're an insurrectionist, you can't run. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7361.4800000000005s)]
*  So therefore as Secretary of State and a political position, she had to say this. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7363.240000000001s)]
*  So it's all just completely disorganized and then it will be conflated as an organized movement, [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7369.0s)]
*  but that's what's actually happening. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7375.240000000001s)]
*  And then, you know, the more you know. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7377.96s)]
*  That's kind of what I suspected. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7382.68s)]
*  That's basically what you said. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7385.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7386.76s)]
*  But yeah, it is ensuring he gets elected. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7387.72s)]
*  Shouts to you, Tom, for knowing what I know. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7390.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7392.6s)]
*  Did you tell him that before? [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7393.240000000001s)]
*  I did. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7394.280000000001s)]
*  I told him. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7394.6s)]
*  I told him right before. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7395.08s)]
*  That's fine. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7395.96s)]
*  Anyway, what a fucking dumb- [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7396.52s)]
*  He told me to kill the pod. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7397.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7399.16s)]
*  What a dumb fucking idea by these local cloud chasers, these local political cloud chasers. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7402.04s)]
*  Trump 2024 is looking more and more probable. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7411.4800000000005s)]
*  Who beats him? [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7414.92s)]
*  Who beats him? [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7416.280000000001s)]
*  Who? [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7418.4400000000005s)]
*  Biden. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7418.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7419.4800000000005s)]
*  I think Biden's only hope is RFK takes Trump's vote, I think. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7420.76s)]
*  But I think RFK might even take more- [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7426.280000000001s)]
*  He'll take some of Biden. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7428.12s)]
*  I think he'll take more of Trump, personally. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7429.16s)]
*  Oh, really? [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7430.68s)]
*  What's your thinking for that? [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7431.24s)]
*  I think he kind of espouses- [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7432.2s)]
*  And this is why I think he could be a Democrat plant. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7433.24s)]
*  Because I think he espouses more of the things that speak to Trump's fan base than- [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7435.64s)]
*  Vaccine. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7439.72s)]
*  Biden's fan base. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7440.12s)]
*  The vaccine is harmful. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7441.08s)]
*  Like, kind of the conspiracy theories he'll float out there. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7442.599999999999s)]
*  That's gonna, I think, take more of Trump's fan base than it is Biden's fan base. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7445.88s)]
*  I think if you're a Democrat who votes for Kennedy, [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7450.84s)]
*  you're just voting for him because he's a Democrat who's not Biden. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7453.16s)]
*  And that could be a lot of people, I don't know. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7457.400000000001s)]
*  But none of us really like Biden. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7459.16s)]
*  We're looking for any solution. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7461.0s)]
*  All right, there's one. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7462.200000000001s)]
*  But I think to empower people, like people will be like, I wanna vote for this guy. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7462.92s)]
*  I think RFK is gonna take more of those Trump people. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7468.04s)]
*  Why don't we like Biden? [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7470.04s)]
*  It just, it feels like everything is a mess. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7471.88s)]
*  It feels like he has no idea what's going on. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7473.88s)]
*  Does it feel like everything's a mess? [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7475.72s)]
*  It feels like other countries don't respect him. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7477.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7480.360000000001s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7480.76s)]
*  That's true. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7481.4800000000005s)]
*  So there's a couple things going on. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7481.96s)]
*  There's one is him, the person, and his mental state and his age. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7483.48s)]
*  I think it's the biggest thing. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7489.0s)]
*  Yeah, that is, and that's a perception thing. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7490.36s)]
*  Do other countries think that we're weak because of this? [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7492.839999999999s)]
*  Do other countries not respect him and his decision making? [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7495.48s)]
*  Are they going to talk to his intermediaries who are actually making decisions? [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7497.879999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7501.32s)]
*  But in terms of how the country is. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7501.799999999999s)]
*  I think we, I think a lot of the country don't feel like he's fit enough to perform his duties. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7505.0s)]
*  So I think that's the biggest thing. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7509.879999999999s)]
*  But 100% get that on board, 100%. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7511.96s)]
*  But in terms of what has happened during his tenure, [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7516.360000000001s)]
*  is there anything that's happened that has made you go, this fucking idiot, [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7520.120000000001s)]
*  look at the country, it's in complete disarray. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7524.92s)]
*  I do think people's ambient sort of personal feeling towards the society [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7527.080000000001s)]
*  is what will reflect whether or not it's based off a direct Biden policy. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7532.04s)]
*  So like war in Russia, and people are like, wow, we're giving so much money to Russia, [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7535.320000000001s)]
*  the whole world's fighting against each other. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7539.080000000001s)]
*  Israel, Palestine, war in the Middle East. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7540.92s)]
*  We lost that British-German trade heavy. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7542.68s)]
*  That was like the Herschel Walker thing. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7545.4s)]
*  Inflation's going up and people can't buy groceries, yada yada yada. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7546.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7550.68s)]
*  Inflation is crazy. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7550.92s)]
*  So I think it's stuff like that where people are like- [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7551.96s)]
*  You could blame on Trump's COVID policies, I don't know. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7553.64s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7556.2s)]
*  I paid $10 for a box of cereal yesterday. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7557.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7559.4800000000005s)]
*  Right. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7559.88s)]
*  So I don't know if you can directly pin it to a Biden policy. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7560.28s)]
*  I'm sure someone could if you wanted to make the argument, [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7563.0s)]
*  but I think it's just a general atmosphere of like, [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7564.84s)]
*  I don't feel optimistic for where America's heading. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7567.4800000000005s)]
*  My suspicion is that that is- [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7570.04s)]
*  That is how I feel. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7571.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7572.04s)]
*  Gotcha. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7572.68s)]
*  That is how people feel every single election cycle. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7573.4s)]
*  I think that every time there's a chance to have a new president, [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7578.5199999999995s)]
*  people think about all their issues and they're like, [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7581.64s)]
*  these issues are this guy's faults, as we should. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7585.08s)]
*  That's the name. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7588.12s)]
*  The job is to take responsibility for everything. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7589.56s)]
*  If shit is booming during that first four years of Clinton, [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7591.96s)]
*  everybody was like, I love this guy. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7596.5199999999995s)]
*  Run it back. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7597.96s)]
*  This was great. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7598.6s)]
*  So you have to take that backlash. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7599.88s)]
*  That's why you're there. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7602.04s)]
*  I just wonder if, I don't know if America is in complete disarray. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7603.48s)]
*  I think it's actually, I think most people would say like the temperature is much lower than Trump. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7608.92s)]
*  Like when Trump was here, everything was white. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7614.759999999999s)]
*  Trump goes, the color blue is good. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7616.679999999999s)]
*  Fuck the color blue. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7618.28s)]
*  How dare you like the color blue? [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7619.08s)]
*  Everything is just an absolute battle between left and right. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7620.599999999999s)]
*  And now just feels like the temperature is lower. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7624.2s)]
*  And I think we attribute that to Biden. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7626.759999999999s)]
*  You have to give him some credit. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7629.0s)]
*  Biden or his handlers or whoever's making decisions. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7630.28s)]
*  I don't really think it's Biden. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7632.52s)]
*  But the economy, yes, there's inflation. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7633.56s)]
*  We also printed $2 trillion. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7636.36s)]
*  Inflation should be 100%. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7638.92s)]
*  The fact that it serials only 10 bucks is astonishing. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7641.64s)]
*  It means doing a good job. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7645.48s)]
*  Everybody, like every, now don't get me wrong. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7647.16s)]
*  I know there are people that are struggling to eat. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7650.68s)]
*  That fucking is horrible. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7652.76s)]
*  But based on what we did, our monetary policy to inject that much cash into the market [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7654.36s)]
*  and have the market not completely flip, there is some sophisticated shit going on. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7661.639999999999s)]
*  All that shit that I talked about the Fed, I should call him, yo, my bad. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7668.36s)]
*  You were fed it up. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7672.5199999999995s)]
*  You were nice. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7674.04s)]
*  Whatever you be doing, do that shit. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7674.92s)]
*  Because we only had 7% inflation or whatever it is, 10% inflation. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7676.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7682.28s)]
*  I think it's very easy to just sit here and go, my God, look at what a fucking [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7683.08s)]
*  inept idiot this corpse is. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7686.2s)]
*  And he might be a corpse. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7687.5599999999995s)]
*  He might be totally checked out. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7688.5199999999995s)]
*  But the administration, which is not what we vote for, we vote for the man. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7689.96s)]
*  But I wonder if we can honestly, objectively go, I don't think the administration has bombed. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7693.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, job numbers are back before pre-pandemic times. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7698.679999999999s)]
*  Like we've actually recovered. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7702.84s)]
*  Not 100%, but in certain areas, we've actually recovered. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7706.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm just saying, if we could object, if Biden was 65 years old and this was happening, [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7710.12s)]
*  I wonder if we have a different sentiment towards him. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7717.24s)]
*  Sure, sure. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7719.5599999999995s)]
*  The problem is he can't, I don't think he has it enough up here to charm us in the way that [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7720.04s)]
*  Barack could or Bill could or even Trump could. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7725.64s)]
*  And we wanna be charmed. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7729.96s)]
*  We wanna be sold on the way out the door. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7731.64s)]
*  You buy a car, the sale doesn't stop when I sign. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7733.48s)]
*  The sale stops when I drive out. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7736.5199999999995s)]
*  That's even after I've paid, it's the best car you're gonna fucking love. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7738.92s)]
*  Oh yeah, and by the way, this thing, sell us on the way out. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7743.08s)]
*  And he just doesn't have it up there to sit in front of a camera and then make us go, [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7745.88s)]
*  that's my president. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7749.96s)]
*  And I think to that point- [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7750.76s)]
*  And that's a problem. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7752.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7752.84s)]
*  He represents America. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7753.48s)]
*  He looks feeble, he looks frail, he looks old. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7755.4s)]
*  In the same way that- [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7758.36s)]
*  But keep, but again, that's a separate argument. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7759.4s)]
*  I'm saying policies and what's going on. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7761.4s)]
*  I'm saying to your point, I think that's why we're looking for the weakness. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7763.72s)]
*  Absolutely, we're always gonna try to criticize the people that are in charge. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7768.36s)]
*  And that, well, here's why I also push back on that. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7772.92s)]
*  One point is I don't think you necessarily, if COVID doesn't happen, people like the left [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7774.5199999999995s)]
*  would have talked all the shit they wanted about Trump and what he's doing and blah, blah, [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7780.44s)]
*  blah. And I think a lot of moderate people would have been like, the economy's kind of [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7783.48s)]
*  kicking ass and taking names. I think I'm okay with this guy, let's ride with this guy. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7786.92s)]
*  This guy meaning Trump. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7791.639999999999s)]
*  If COVID doesn't happen. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7793.4s)]
*  Agree, easily. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7794.44s)]
*  Fuck the whole thing. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7794.92s)]
*  Easily. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7795.639999999999s)]
*  But yeah, so I think we're not to that point of like, we just look for what's wrong every, [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7796.28s)]
*  to a degree, yes. But I think generally, we take stock, we pull back and we're like, [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7800.84s)]
*  what do we feel like the nation, do we feel like it's getting stronger or getting weaker? [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7805.32s)]
*  100%. And that can be a single issue determination for voting for some people. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7809.719999999999s)]
*  It's like, how is the nation perceived? If my identity is built into being American and [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7818.599999999999s)]
*  America is being perceived as weak, now I'm being perceived as weak. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7824.2s)]
*  Wait, but even how do I feel the nation is doing? Like, where's it going? [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7827.72s)]
*  Is it going up or going down? [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7831.4s)]
*  What I'm saying is that might be indicative of how people feel about it. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7832.36s)]
*  Because if we're looking at the nation right now, based on the policies of the Biden [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7837.16s)]
*  administration, it's handled what it's went through incredibly well. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7842.2s)]
*  Yeah, maybe. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7845.96s)]
*  Objectively speaking and compared to other countries, like eggs and shit cost way more [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7846.44s)]
*  in Canada. Like the way our inflation has been managed, you go down to fucking Argentina, [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7851.08s)]
*  it's 100% inflation on a Tuesday, 50% on a Wednesday. What's happened with injecting [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7857.24s)]
*  that kind of money into the economy is incredible. Are we gonna have to pay for it eventually? [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7863.64s)]
*  Probably. Maybe we've just been peeing on ourselves. There's that saying, as long as [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7867.88s)]
*  you're peeing on yourself, it's warm. You run out of pee, gets cold and uncomfortable. So maybe [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7871.96s)]
*  we're just pushing that off and pushing that off and pushing that off. They're gonna drop [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7876.76s)]
*  interest rates, probably around election time, because they want us all to feel like we have a [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7880.28s)]
*  lot of money and we can go buy things. They're gonna do that. That's the game and everybody [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7885.719999999999s)]
*  does it. When that happens, it might just push it even further. Eventually we might have to pay [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7889.8s)]
*  for what's happening. I guess what I'm saying is if we could remove our human instinct to look for [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7897.5599999999995s)]
*  a leader and look for someone to blame for problems. If we could just look at how the [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7902.36s)]
*  country is doing for us right now compared to how other countries are doing. If our inflation [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7907.56s)]
*  is 10% and everyone else is 20, we go, well, shit, my man, you killing it. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7911.96s)]
*  But I don't think we're capable of doing that. I think it's just like, what am I frustrated at? [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7918.280000000001s)]
*  I don't like that this guy's stumbling around and falling off of bicycles. People in other [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7922.120000000001s)]
*  countries are making fun of us. Fuck those guys. Yeah, we need somebody who can tell those other [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7925.400000000001s)]
*  countries suck our dick. Trump will do that. To that point, I think a lot of people would be [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7929.88s)]
*  happy with any other Democrat that seems young and fit. Booty Judge, I think people will be like, [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7933.4s)]
*  yo, that guy, he seems young, he seems sharp. The country's doing well with Democrats, [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7938.599999999999s)]
*  just put a different guy there as the face of the country. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7944.759999999999s)]
*  That's why I think a lot of Democrats are like, dude, Joe, don't run again. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7948.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's astonishing how little talent. It's astonishing. I mean, Kamala just absolutely bombed. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7952.44s)]
*  I mean, just- [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7956.679999999999s)]
*  Does he have to roam with Kamala again if he's doing a reelection? [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7957.4s)]
*  It's disgusting. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7961.16s)]
*  It's rare to fire your VC. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7962.84s)]
*  And the optics of firing the first black female, whatever vice president is horrendous for what [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7964.92s)]
*  the U.S. Attorney is to fire- [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7970.44s)]
*  But for her to just completely sit back and just- [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7972.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7976.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, they could push her resign and say, I want more time with the fam. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7976.92s)]
*  That's true. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7981.0s)]
*  She ain't doing that. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7981.64s)]
*  Because that is a concern for the reelection. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7982.36s)]
*  It's half black, half Indian, she ain't listening to nobody. I'll tell you that right now. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7984.12s)]
*  The election is like, we're electing somebody that probably won't [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7987.64s)]
*  stay in office through his term. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7994.200000000001s)]
*  Who do you think's a good VP if they replace- [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7995.88s)]
*  Nobody believes in Kamala. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7998.200000000001s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. Who do you think would be a good one? [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=7999.56s)]
*  Like, it might be Monument. I don't know who's worse, her or Hillary. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=8001.0s)]
*  Hillary. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=8007.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think Hillary's less likeable. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=8007.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=8009.320000000001s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=8009.72s)]
*  Yes, less likeable, but Kamala had everything going. The world was waiting to like her. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=8010.360000000001s)]
*  And every time she spoke, more and more people were like, I can't do it. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=8017.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, I just can't do it. It's crazy. Imagine she was white. Thank God she's not. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=8021.8s)]
*  If she was white, you'd really hear it. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=8028.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=8030.4400000000005s)]
*  You would really hear it. Black people can't say how horrible Kamala is because she's black. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=8030.76s)]
*  If she was white, they would be on that ass. How the fuck did this goofy get into office? [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=8035.08s)]
*  I think we're just giving her a hard time, guys. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=8039.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=8041.72s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. I don't know who you run as a VP. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=8045.240000000001s)]
*  It's astonishing how little talent there is in a Democratic party. It's unbelievable. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=8047.72s)]
*  We're Republican side too. That's why Trump was able to body everybody. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=8052.6s)]

*  They are terrified to be themselves because every single word that they could potentially say [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=8069.56s)]
*  is going to remove that thing that they've coveted since they're 20 years old. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=8074.76s)]
*  I think that's the scientist. He's just falling apart. He's wearing heels and shit. He's like, [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=8079.400000000001s)]

*  What a stupid fight to pick. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=8104.68s)]

*  He took control of the board, but Disney dissolved the board so they had no power, [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=8128.04s)]
*  and basically just showed he was impotent. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=8132.12s)]
*  He got caught up in saying woke too much. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=8134.04s)]

*  is it's all about woke, and it's like, all right, man, it's not all about woke. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=8146.04s)]
*  He's literally saying the problem with corporate America is it's too woke and it's fraudulent, [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfh57PZbJg&t=8151.160000000001s)]
