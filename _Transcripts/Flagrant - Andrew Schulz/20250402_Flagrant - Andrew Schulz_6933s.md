# NYC Mayor Adams on Bribery Charges, Corruption, & Which Borough Has The Baddest Shawtys
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s)
*  The mayor is the second most powerful position in America. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=0.0s)]
*  Do you know, like, what happened with Epstein? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  As Obama said, if you say it, they got to kill you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Oh wait, so do you know? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=7.04s)]
*  No, no, no, I have no idea. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=8.4s)]
*  So tell us what happened with the migrant crisis. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=12.72s)]
*  Oh, great question. So let's talk about the migrants. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=14.88s)]
*  This cost us seven billion dollars. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=16.8s)]
*  This was the tipping point where I decided [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=19.76s)]
*  I got to publicly criticize the Biden administration. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=21.92s)]
*  Yeah, so listen, and I don't want to get conspiratorial. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=24.48s)]
*  After you come out, all of a sudden, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=26.72s)]
*  the Justice Department looks into Eric Adams. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=28.4s)]
*  And there's this thing about Turkish airlines, right? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  Do you think there's any connection to those two things? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=33.44s)]
*  You're darn right I do. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  Do you know who you think it came from? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=36.56s)]
*  Like, that's a great question. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=38.96s)]
*  And I don't want to sound conspiracy theory, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=40.0s)]
*  but there's a permanent government. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  Is this like what people refer to? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=44.56s)]
*  And I think this word has been used too much, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=46.72s)]
*  but like the deep states or whatever it is. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  It's not used too much. It's real, brother. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  Mayors come and go, presidents come and go, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=53.12s)]
*  governors come and go, permanent government is real. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=55.44s)]
*  Women try to act like it's not real, they're lying. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=58.080000000000005s)]
*  Which borough has the most attractive women? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=60.720000000000006s)]
*  I think all of them have great shorties. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=63.52s)]
*  This is awesome. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=71.04s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=71.84s)]
*  Born and raised New Yorkers, Alex and I. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=75.04s)]
*  Far Rockaway. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=75.36s)]
*  Oh, the Rock. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=76.08000000000001s)]
*  I probably know who you're shorty is. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=77.28s)]
*  I have a shorty. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=78.88s)]
*  This girl's got to be so gassed right now. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=85.6s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=87.52s)]
*  She's got to be telling everybody, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=88.08s)]
*  I'm your shorty in Far Rock. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=89.83999999999999s)]
*  I'm your shorty. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=92.08s)]
*  Do we know who that girl is? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  You know, it's like, what's that story? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=96.32s)]
*  What's that shorty that used to come on with the reals? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=98.08s)]
*  The real world. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  No, the truth. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=102.24s)]
*  They asked the person, the panelist questions, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=104.0s)]
*  and they said with the real, whoever is staying up. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=106.32s)]
*  I forgot his truth. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=110.0s)]
*  Is this true? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=110.96s)]
*  Something to do with the truth. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=111.44s)]
*  Lying to me, maybe? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=111.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=112.72s)]
*  Now, I'll get the name of it to come to me when it comes on. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=113.2s)]
*  So, you know, probably everybody's running around [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=115.76s)]
*  and saying, I'm the shorty. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=117.12s)]
*  I'm the shorty. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=118.0s)]
*  I'm the shorty. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=118.56s)]
*  You know? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=119.2s)]
*  Oh, so you have a lot of other girls claiming [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=119.76s)]
*  that they're the shorty. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  So it's possible there could be multiple shorties on Far Rock. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=122.88s)]
*  He made that shirt one time. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=131.12s)]
*  He's like, it's too far. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=132.32s)]
*  We got girls in Jamaica. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=135.04s)]
*  Guys, this is not the show. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=138.16s)]
*  Today, our illustrious guest is a true New York success story. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=139.36s)]
*  I don't know if this has ever happened before. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=144.08s)]
*  I don't know if it'll ever happen again. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=146.0s)]
*  From my research, he went from literally one of the dudes [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=148.56s)]
*  doing the squeegee on your car when you have to stop, sign, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=153.28s)]
*  and you don't want it, to mayor of New York City. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=156.48s)]
*  Give it up for Eric Adams, everybody. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=159.2s)]
*  OK, is that true about the squeegee? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=162.8s)]
*  You know, the... [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=165.36s)]
*  You know, but back then, you had to be creative to just help the family. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=170.08s)]
*  I think that is what the total sum of your life experiences [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=178.24s)]
*  allowed you to be whomever you are. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=184.08s)]
*  Like, all of you, you sit in a room, you guys are successful, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=187.04s)]
*  but think about the total of all of your experiences. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=189.84s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=192.64s)]
*  Get in here, sit down, and have real authentic conversations. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=193.36s)]
*  That's why people connect with your show. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=196.48s)]
*  Because it's just an authentic conversation. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=198.48s)]
*  Dude, this is one of the things that we were, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=202.48s)]
*  as we were doing Prep For This, I'm watching all these videos from you, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=204.64s)]
*  and I'm like, I'm so curious, are you aware of the moments you have that go viral? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=207.11999999999998s)]
*  Does it hit you? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=214.23999999999998s)]
*  Like, it hits... [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=215.04s)]
*  Because you say some stuff. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=215.92s)]
*  Obviously, the Shorty and Far Rock thing was crazy, right? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=217.35999999999999s)]
*  But there are other things you say, like, remember when you were... [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=219.92s)]
*  We have the video, I almost want you to watch it, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  like when you were teaching the parents how to find drugs in their kids. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=224.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=228.07999999999998s)]
*  Okay, okay, okay. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=229.2s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=230.32s)]
*  Have you watched this? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=231.6s)]
*  Yes, yes. I love this piece. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=232.39999999999998s)]
*  Greatest hits. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=240.48s)]
*  All right, all right, let's get to it, break it down. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=241.12s)]
*  As a baby doll, it could be just a baby doll, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=244.88s)]
*  but also it could be a place where you could secrete or hide drugs. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=247.76s)]
*  I don't know what you're talking about. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=251.44s)]
*  Over the pillow. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=252.32s)]
*  Those are just pillows. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=254.64s)]
*  Those are just pillows. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=255.35999999999999s)]
*  Like a pillow like this with a button. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=256.0s)]
*  Oh, the button. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=257.84s)]
*  Invitation to hide something. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=258.72s)]
*  I felt something bumpy. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=260.56s)]
*  I would reach in, see what it is. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=262.16s)]
*  It's just a pillow. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=263.44s)]
*  Oh, damn. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=264.48s)]
*  Damn. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=265.6s)]
*  A pillow, a gun. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=266.4s)]
*  Look how fat I was. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=267.6s)]
*  Now, each one of those scenarios that you saw, the gun in the pillow, the baby doll, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=271.12s)]
*  those were real scenarios. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=277.68s)]
*  Yeah, you bumped into people. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=278.96s)]
*  People who either was arrested, because a lot of people don't know [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=281.04s)]
*  if your child or someone in your household is doing something improper, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=285.12s)]
*  they come in and they do a warrant. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=289.6s)]
*  They're taking everybody. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=291.76s)]
*  Oh, they're taking parents? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=292.8s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=294.24s)]
*  And so parents often didn't even know what was happening in their home. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=294.88s)]
*  And so I said, you know what, I'm getting all these stories. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=299.28000000000003s)]
*  So I said, we're going to do a video to show how do you just go through [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=301.92s)]
*  and see what's in your house? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=306.88s)]
*  Because children are slick. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=308.32s)]
*  And there's a lot of indicators. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=311.12s)]
*  Like, if you see a cut straw with a point on the tip of it, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=312.48s)]
*  the average parent don't know what that is. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=316.0s)]
*  I don't know what that is. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=317.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's sniffing. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=318.32s)]
*  You sniffed back then, you were sniffing coke. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=319.28000000000003s)]
*  Back then. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=321.20000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=321.76s)]
*  I thought it was a Capri Sun. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=324.56s)]
*  So it's sort of wrong to set parents up and not give them the basic information. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=325.92s)]
*  Now, there was a lot of people, I got a lot of pushback from those who were saying, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=333.36s)]
*  oh, you know, you're violating the rights. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=337.92s)]
*  Listen, in the hood, man, this is real stuff. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=339.76s)]
*  Don't tell me the life you're living. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=343.35999999999996s)]
*  I'm telling you the life in the... [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=345.28s)]
*  You're saying you're violating your kids' rights? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=346.64s)]
*  I feel like in your house, your kids... [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=348.47999999999996s)]
*  How many times do I have to say that? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=350.0s)]
*  Listen, mom would tell me in a minute, man, boy, you don't have no rights. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=353.12s)]
*  Because this is an interesting story, right? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=360.56s)]
*  You started out as a kid, and I'm doing some research, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=362.32s)]
*  and you had a kind of tough upbringing. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=365.52s)]
*  You were doing some kind of, I mean, around some wild stuff, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=368.32s)]
*  is how you were saying it. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=371.36s)]
*  And now the question is why. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=372.96000000000004s)]
*  When you wake up every morning, there was a ritual, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=375.6s)]
*  like I have a ritual now that I do every morning. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=378.16s)]
*  But when you woke up every morning... [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=380.48s)]
*  What's the ritual? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=381.92s)]
*  I'm going to tell you what the ritual back there when I was a child. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=383.52000000000004s)]
*  Because we got some crystals for you. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=385.76s)]
*  And let's see, stones have a lot of energy, and I want to share that. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=387.04s)]
*  We got a lot to talk about in an hour and a half. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=390.32s)]
*  What type of stone? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=393.92s)]
*  Crack stone has tons of energy. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=394.64s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=396.32s)]
*  Best way to start the morning. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=398.64s)]
*  But I used to start the morning, every morning, praying, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=400.64s)]
*  you know, God don't make me read. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=404.40000000000003s)]
*  God don't make you read. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=406.56s)]
*  In school. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=407.6s)]
*  Because I was... [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=408.48s)]
*  Dyslexic. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=409.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=410.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=410.56s)]
*  And if I read something and stumbled over the words the whole day... [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=411.12s)]
*  You know, kids are cute, but you know what? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=415.52s)]
*  No, they're ruthless. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=417.68s)]
*  They would say, let's act like we're Eric Reden. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=420.08s)]
*  They would stumble over the... [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=422.24s)]
*  You know, right. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=424.48s)]
*  And so the whole day you would go... [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=425.2s)]
*  You couldn't read the words. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=426.56s)]
*  Look it up. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=427.68s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=428.40000000000003s)]
*  When you look at it, and when you have dyslexia... [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=429.6s)]
*  You're like, put that to him. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=431.20000000000005s)]
*  It mixes up the characters. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=433.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=435.12s)]
*  And so it was to me, I was like, listen, why are you going to school, man? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=435.68s)]
*  Why are you going in classroom every day? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=438.8s)]
*  I started doing numbers back then before numbers were legal. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=441.36s)]
*  What does that mean to people? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=444.8s)]
*  Because I think running numbers means like what? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=445.84000000000003s)]
*  There's some people that are running a gambling ring, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=448.16s)]
*  and you're making sure that they get those... [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=450.72s)]
*  Great question. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=452.88s)]
*  Great question. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=453.44000000000005s)]
*  How does that even work? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=453.92s)]
*  Before the numbers... [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=454.72s)]
*  I sound like I'm snitching right now. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=455.76000000000005s)]
*  Before the lottery system was in place, there was a... [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=458.8s)]
*  You look in a newspaper at the racetracks, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=462.40000000000003s)]
*  and you see these last three numbers, digits, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=464.72s)]
*  and you could bet on what those last three digits were going to be. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=467.84000000000003s)]
*  So it's a gambling ring. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=473.44000000000005s)]
*  I've heard about this, and I definitely heard that [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=475.44000000000005s)]
*  it no longer exists in the Dominican neighborhoods in New York. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=477.68s)]
*  They definitely don't have their own gambling ring or lottery system. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=481.52000000000004s)]
*  So that's what the lottery would be. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=484.96000000000004s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=486.48s)]
*  If you could predict those numbers, they're privatized. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=486.72s)]
*  50 cents, 25 cents would give you a certain dollar amount. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=489.92s)]
*  50 cents would give you a certain dollar. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=494.72s)]
*  So you walk around with these slips, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=496.0s)]
*  you go around the community that come inside the stores, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=497.52000000000004s)]
*  and they say, okay, I think 382. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=500.32000000000005s)]
*  I had a dream last night, and I saw 382. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=502.16s)]
*  You're better than that. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=504.88000000000005s)]
*  People bet all the time on those numbers and hinges. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=505.52000000000004s)]
*  There were newspapers that were in the community, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=510.16s)]
*  whole industry around numbers. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=513.6s)]
*  Giving you advice on the numbers? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=516.0799999999999s)]
*  And so what I learned later in life, I learned I was dyslexic in college, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=517.6s)]
*  and I heard a young lady listening to a documentary on dyslexia. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=524.0799999999999s)]
*  And I took it out, and I said, wait a minute, man, I'm not dumb, I'm dyslexic. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=529.68s)]
*  So I went from a D student to a A student once I learned. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=532.88s)]
*  Now, when you look at all these young people who are incarcerated, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=538.48s)]
*  30 to 40% of them across the country are dyslexic or have a learning disability. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=543.04s)]
*  Wow. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=547.04s)]
*  So if you feel- [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=548.0s)]
*  They're struggling in school, there's no other opportunity. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=549.04s)]
*  It's like a pipeline. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=551.12s)]
*  They go to, ah, that's interesting. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=551.84s)]
*  They go, so the crime is not only what they did on the street, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=553.76s)]
*  it's what we're doing to them. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=557.92s)]
*  Right, so being able to diagnose these things earlier. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=559.52s)]
*  Same with like mental health, a lot of people say. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=561.6800000000001s)]
*  Right, right now we're doing dyslexia screening. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=563.52s)]
*  So we're catching a young person and giving them the services that they need [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=567.04s)]
*  that they don't feel that they're done. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=571.28s)]
*  How do you even fix dyslexia? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=573.04s)]
*  What do you do? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=574.3199999999999s)]
*  All you do is learn differently. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=576.56s)]
*  Your mind processes, because the words are mumbled, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=578.9599999999999s)]
*  the letters are mumbled, jumbled, mixed up. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=581.8399999999999s)]
*  But once you learn how to process and learn differently how you learn- [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=583.76s)]
*  You can reorganize. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=588.64s)]
*  Exactly, exactly. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=589.28s)]
*  And so that led to, like you said, all that crazy stuff you were doing. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=590.3199999999999s)]
*  I said, why am I sitting in school? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=594.0799999999999s)]
*  So once you become the A student, now you go, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=597.36s)]
*  I need to put those other people in jail. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=599.52s)]
*  Like those other people. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=601.12s)]
*  That's how you feel. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=602.8s)]
*  Like why would these criminals take advantage of my disability [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=604.72s)]
*  and put me on the streets? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=607.04s)]
*  That's how you feel. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=608.0s)]
*  Then you get locked up. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=608.4s)]
*  And so it was- [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=610.16s)]
*  Dyslexic people, you locked up. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=613.68s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=615.52s)]
*  He's excited about it. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=619.84s)]
*  I'm bumping to people all the time who are doing successful in business [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=625.28s)]
*  when they hear my journey being dyslexic, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=629.12s)]
*  they all say to stop me and say, Eric, I went through the same thing [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=631.92s)]
*  and I'm successful in business. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=635.44s)]
*  Because once you push through that, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=637.12s)]
*  you find that you would get through just about anything. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=639.68s)]
*  So when people run around now yelling, booing, oh, we don't like this, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=641.92s)]
*  we don't like that, because you're in New York, 8.3 million people, 35 million opinions. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=645.92s)]
*  A lot of opinions. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=648.64s)]
*  I say to them, that's all you got? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=649.76s)]
*  All you got is to call me a name? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=653.04s)]
*  Listen, I'm so used to being called names. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=654.88s)]
*  I used to get called names every morning. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=656.5600000000001s)]
*  You built this. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=658.96s)]
*  What's the best thing you've been called? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=660.24s)]
*  Like, is there anything you've been called where you're like, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=661.68s)]
*  nah, that's kind of funny. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=663.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=666.96s)]
*  Probably asshole is not the top one. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=667.52s)]
*  People call, listen, hurt people hurt people and they hurt themselves. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=673.2s)]
*  It's not like, I hate you, Eric. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=678.24s)]
*  People are hating themselves. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=680.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=682.16s)]
*  They express that hate through how they treat people. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=683.76s)]
*  We're in a place now where everyone is so mean-spirited. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=688.16s)]
*  People don't do this. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=693.8399999999999s)]
*  This is powerful when you can sit down and have deep... [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=694.7199999999999s)]
*  Have conversations. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=696.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=697.28s)]
*  We should seek to understand so that we can be understood. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=698.0799999999999s)]
*  We have that conversation all the time here, which is like, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=702.56s)]
*  nobody wants to understand anybody. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=704.64s)]
*  Everybody wants to dunk, score a point so that their party or affiliation or group [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=705.92s)]
*  feels good about themselves instead of trying to understand what that person's going through. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=711.28s)]
*  Social media makes it even worse. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=715.12s)]
*  Yeah, because you're getting patted on the back every time you do it. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=716.56s)]
*  There's a reward system built into it. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=719.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=721.68s)]
*  It's the coalescing of everyone who has a ill feeling. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=722.9599999999999s)]
*  Now you're not alone with your ill feeling. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=730.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=732.24s)]
*  And you can coalesce around this feeling that you have. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=732.9599999999999s)]
*  No matter what group you are, I did an experiment the other day. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=738.8s)]
*  I said, just think of anything you think about. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=741.5999999999999s)]
*  There's a population out there. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=743.76s)]
*  I said, let me just find people that like grass, not cannabis, grass. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=745.28s)]
*  No, you don't like the weed. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=753.4399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=754.64s)]
*  It's unbelievable how many people coalesce around there. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=757.04s)]
*  First of all, I feel people should have a right to smoke cannabis if they want. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=761.4399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=765.12s)]
*  My concern, as I said it when I was running for office, is that we have a real educational [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=765.6s)]
*  problems. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=772.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=772.72s)]
*  And our children starting their day, these teachers tell me, these kids are high all the time. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=773.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=777.68s)]
*  If you start your day walking to school and you're smoking a joint, you're sitting inside the [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=779.4399999999999s)]
*  classroom, you're smoking a joint during a period, these children are not going to be ready. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=784.96s)]
*  It's particularly at a younger age when their brains are real developing, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=790.96s)]
*  there's some real science. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=794.72s)]
*  So if adult wants to smoke, go do your thing. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=795.9200000000001s)]
*  But we have to be real concerned about what's happening with our children and cannabis. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=799.0400000000001s)]
*  I feel like most people are supportive of that. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=803.0400000000001s)]
*  I think most adults in New York would go, hey, we got to keep weed out of the kids [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=805.0400000000001s)]
*  and we got to protect the kids. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=808.88s)]
*  I feel like, yeah, I feel like most adults in New York are supportive of that. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=810.32s)]
*  I almost feel like there's a lot of support around issues in New York, but there's not a [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=813.6s)]
*  lot of understanding on how issues get fixed. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=817.6s)]
*  And that's one of the things about like, I'm always curious when I talk to elected officials. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=820.24s)]
*  It's like, it's your fault no matter what happens, it's your fault. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=824.32s)]
*  Even if you don't have the power to change it. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=829.44s)]
*  Especially the mayor, man. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=831.9200000000001s)]
*  Bro. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=832.96s)]
*  And I always say this, I'm like, the mayor is the second most powerful position in America, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=834.48s)]
*  the mayor of New York. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=838.1600000000001s)]
*  I didn't even know that the governor was a woman until like a month ago. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=839.84s)]
*  I've never known that we had a blind guy governor. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=844.24s)]
*  I didn't know. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=847.2s)]
*  New York is not a state, it's a city. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=847.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=849.5200000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=850.42s)]
*  Right, there you go. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=850.98s)]
*  You ask people in Texas, New York, they're not thinking of the state. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=851.38s)]
*  I grew up in Texas, I only thought of the city. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=853.78s)]
*  And that is our, I guess our blind spot is like not seeing outside the city, but it's like, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=855.38s)]
*  if you are, there's the president of the United States, and then next it's the mayor of New York, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=859.6999999999999s)]
*  and then there's the rest of the people in government. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=863.3s)]
*  And that's why civics is crucial so people can understand who's responsible. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=865.38s)]
*  For these different things. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=870.66s)]
*  Right, because when you're the mayor, I don't care what it is, man. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=871.6999999999999s)]
*  It's your fault. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=874.26s)]
*  Guy stepped to me a couple of months ago, man, saying, listen, I'm getting divorced. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=874.98s)]
*  You know, it's your fault. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=878.66s)]
*  I'm getting divorced with my wife in Far Rock. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=879.94s)]
*  Some vegan guy was walking around. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=887.1400000000001s)]
*  Lady, me, stop. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=890.34s)]
*  That one is your fault. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=893.62s)]
*  That one is your fault. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=894.5s)]
*  That was all you. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=895.3800000000001s)]
*  That was all you. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=897.62s)]
*  That's the case is. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=898.34s)]
*  So people are saying, well, you know, the trains are not operating where they're supposed to. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=900.82s)]
*  That's the state, man. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=906.6600000000001s)]
*  That's not the city. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=907.62s)]
*  So wait, the trains meaning like? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=909.06s)]
*  The subway, the two, three, four and five. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=910.66s)]
*  The state is in charge of that. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=913.38s)]
*  The state is in charge of the MTA. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=915.14s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=916.82s)]
*  Our job is to protect the people. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=917.38s)]
*  I'm in charge of the police in the system. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=919.54s)]
*  And what we've done in the system is unbelievable. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=922.5s)]
*  A lot of people, like when I walk in rooms and I say, tell me how many crimes you think, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=924.58s)]
*  serious crimes you think happen in the subway system. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=927.62s)]
*  People say 100, 200 a day, 300 a day. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=930.26s)]
*  We have 4.6 million riders every day. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=932.9s)]
*  We have six felonies a day. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=936.82s)]
*  Out of 4.6 million, I don't feel like going to work. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=938.82s)]
*  I'm pissed off. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=942.34s)]
*  People on the subway. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=943.54s)]

*  TheMarkGagnon.com. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1021.86s)]
*  I'll see you on the road. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1022.8199999999999s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1023.4599999999999s)]
*  Love you all. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1023.9399999999999s)]
*  Bye. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1024.34s)]
*  So there's a good question, right? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1024.58s)]
*  It's like there are two things. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1025.94s)]
*  There are the data, the facts, like the reality of what's happening. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1028.1s)]
*  And then there's the feeling that people have. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1031.94s)]
*  Without a doubt. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1034.66s)]
*  And we got to be careful that if people have that feeling, we don't make them feel stupid [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1035.46s)]
*  for having it because being scared in the subway is a real feeling. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1041.3s)]
*  And maybe now that there's more phone videos and I hear about all these stories, like, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1044.5s)]
*  I know my wife, she says she feels uncomfortable in the subway. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1048.42s)]
*  I know probably now because she uses it to Uber. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1050.98s)]
*  But it's a convenient excuse. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1054.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1056.34s)]
*  But no, like some of the girls that work for us also say they have that feeling. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1056.82s)]
*  When I grew up in the city, I was like sleeping on the subway on the way to school. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1059.54s)]
*  I never even, now don't get me wrong, I got robbed before, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1063.54s)]
*  but it wasn't on the subway. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1067.14s)]
*  It was like there's people around. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1068.18s)]
*  So now ask yourself, because I'm big on that. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1069.6200000000001s)]
*  Back in 2022, when I said, listen, we have to deal with the perception and the reality. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1071.94s)]
*  People attacked me when I said that. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1081.14s)]
*  They said, well, perception doesn't matter. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1082.9s)]
*  I said, yes, it does. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1085.54s)]
*  Perception matters. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1086.3400000000001s)]
*  Because I was a transit cop. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1087.14s)]
*  So I remember. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1088.26s)]
*  And so what happens, so now we have to ask ourselves, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1089.22s)]
*  why do people feel unsafe in the subway system? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1092.9s)]
*  Why do you think? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1095.54s)]
*  Because every day we take the worst thing that happens on four points. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1096.8200000000002s)]
*  And every day we blast it. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1101.14s)]
*  Every day, every day. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1102.5s)]
*  And so you wake up in the morning, open the paper, oh, someone got pushed on the subway track. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1103.7s)]
*  Now you may have never had a negative experience. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1108.58s)]
*  Someone got pushed on the subway track. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1110.82s)]
*  Then you go down in the system and you see someone walking with no shoes on, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1112.1s)]
*  no shirt on, they're yelling and screaming. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1115.06s)]
*  You hear noise. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1116.98s)]
*  You hear it's not cleaning up. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1118.5s)]
*  You begin to say to yourself, oh, I'm feeling unsafe. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1120.02s)]
*  I'm feeling safe. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1122.98s)]
*  And so what I have to do, as you said, I'm not going to go to you and insult you and say [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1123.6999999999998s)]
*  you shouldn't feel a certain way. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1128.6599999999999s)]
*  No, I have to answer that fear. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1129.9399999999998s)]
*  So that's why we put a thousand more cops in the system. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1131.86s)]
*  We have them riding the trains back and forth. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1134.4199999999998s)]
*  When I was a transit cop, that's what I did. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1136.34s)]
*  I rode it back and forth because we know the omnipresence of that uniform can deal with [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1137.94s)]
*  that perception. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1143.14s)]
*  Now we got record decreases in crime, but that means nothing if people don't feel safe. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1144.18s)]
*  Well, maybe it's a combination of both of those things. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1150.18s)]
*  Maybe it's telling people, hey, we are going to address that and we're putting more cops [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1155.14s)]
*  out there so you feel safe. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1159.54s)]
*  And then after that going, hey, by the way, crime statistics compared from last quarter [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1160.98s)]
*  or whatever you do are down 50%. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1166.82s)]
*  So look at this positive influence that's happening. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1168.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1171.22s)]
*  And I feel like all too often it's people going, no, you idiots. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1171.46s)]
*  Look, crime is way better. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1174.98s)]
*  And then they're like, don't call me an idiot. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1176.34s)]
*  Fuck you. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1177.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1178.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1178.5s)]
*  And I get some pushback on above ground. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1178.8999999999999s)]
*  I walk around New York City a lot. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1182.1799999999998s)]
*  I moved here, oh, wait. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1183.86s)]
*  And I will say it feels less safe like just seeing I was walking here one day from 59th. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1185.3s)]
*  It was a long walk, but I was like, let's do it. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1191.06s)]
*  On one block, I see like four guys shooting heroin. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1193.3s)]
*  I see another guy, literal piece of his intestine sticking out of his stomach, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1195.46s)]
*  covered in what looks like shit. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1198.66s)]
*  When I go to Penn Station, I used to live in Jersey. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1201.38s)]
*  I'll take it every day. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1203.46s)]
*  I see people shooting up heroin right outside. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1204.58s)]
*  These are not things that make me feel safe. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1207.06s)]
*  And that is a crime. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1208.9s)]
*  It might not be aggravated, but I'm not even saying this to dunk on you or whatever. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1211.6200000000001s)]
*  But I will say as someone who's lived here 17 years, it does feel less safe when I'm [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1216.58s)]
*  walking through. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1220.82s)]
*  And I see stuff that makes me feel like this doesn't feel better. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1221.3s)]
*  And I would tell him, I was like, for a person who grew up here my entire life, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1224.42s)]
*  it's safer than it's ever been. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1227.86s)]
*  That's why it's just so weird hearing that because I'm like, yo, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1230.58s)]
*  I think a lot of times square back in the day. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1233.78s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1235.86s)]
*  It might be safer than it was in 1998. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1236.58s)]
*  But I don't think it's safer personally than it was in 2009. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1239.14s)]
*  A lot of the sentiment is like, we went through a pretty tough time in New York. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1242.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1247.3s)]
*  Where it was like, there were a lot of things that were quite commonplace. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1247.94s)]
*  You started stealing because you're dyslexic. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1250.82s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1252.34s)]
*  Like, you know what I mean? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1252.98s)]
*  People are talking about New York was. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1253.94s)]
*  They were like, I mix up letters, let me just start running numbers. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1255.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1258.18s)]
*  How could you read if it was a Jansport? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1261.7s)]
*  When you go back to when they were growing up and you go back to that period of time, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1266.34s)]
*  graffiti was everywhere on all our trains. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1271.46s)]
*  You should see some of the pictures back then. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1274.42s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1275.78s)]
*  And so understand, that's why civic is important. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1276.5s)]
*  Because when you see some of like right now, when I became a mayor, we were having encampments [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1279.94s)]
*  all over. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1285.8600000000001s)]
*  People living in cardboard boxes and tents on the side of highways. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1286.18s)]
*  And when we came in, we said, listen, people are not living that way. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1289.54s)]
*  January and February of 2022, I went into the streets to talk to people that lived in [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1292.5800000000002s)]
*  these encampments, saw human waste, drug power, finality, stale food, dyslexia, bipolar, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1296.74s)]
*  schizophrenia. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1304.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1305.3s)]
*  And so we came up with a real initiative that said, listen, we cleaned up these encampments [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1305.78s)]
*  and we put people in houses. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1309.54s)]
*  We got a huge pushback, huge pushback. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1311.46s)]
*  The city council passed a law that said people should have the right to sleep on the streets. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1314.42s)]
*  So when you have those government entities that are extremely left in their philosophies, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1318.98s)]
*  what everyday New Yorkers want, they're pushing back. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1327.22s)]
*  I'm fighting tooth and nail to do involuntary removal. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1329.94s)]
*  Like you said, someone you saw someone injecting themselves undressed, screaming, not take [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1332.6599999999999s)]
*  care of themselves. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1336.58s)]
*  I'm fighting to say, I got to get this person in care. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1337.54s)]
*  He doesn't know he needs care. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1340.18s)]
*  These are the battles we have that fall outside the scope of what the mayor can do. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1341.86s)]
*  We have CCTV everywhere. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1348.8999999999999s)]
*  Why don't we have any security cameras inside the subway cars? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1350.74s)]
*  Oh, we do. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1353.86s)]
*  We're going to house. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1355.1399999999999s)]
*  Right now? [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1357.22s)]
*  Right now. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1358.02s)]
*  We're going to build out all the trains, but the governor has done an amazing job where [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1359.62s)]
*  we have cameras in the cars and they're going to be cameras in every car, which is huge [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1364.26s)]
*  because that allows us to pick up on any illegal behavior. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1368.98s)]
*  It allows us. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1372.9s)]
*  We caught the guy that burned the woman to death because of that camera and that footage. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1374.26s)]
*  So we do. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1379.46s)]
*  Eventually, every train is going to have a camera. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1380.5s)]
*  I feel like sometimes cops are like this backstop to all the problems in society. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1384.34s)]
*  Mental health, we're not addressing. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1390.9s)]
*  And there's a person that's crazy on the street and then there's a cop who might not be trained [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1393.06s)]
*  in how to deal with crazy people. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1398.26s)]
*  He's trained in how to uphold the law. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1400.26s)]
*  But now it's his responsibility to protect these people from crazy people and to protect [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1402.34s)]
*  that crazy person from themselves. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1406.58s)]
*  I wonder if there's like, I don't know if it's expansion or more specific division, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1409.94s)]
*  but it seems like a lot of the problems we see on the streets that are making people feel unsafe [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1415.06s)]
*  are people who are dealing with severe mental illness. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1418.66s)]
*  Without a doubt. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1420.82s)]
*  We have three issues that overshadowed our success. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1422.42s)]
*  We turned around the city. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1426.02s)]
*  No one thought I could do it. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1427.06s)]
*  They told me it was going to take five years. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1429.14s)]
*  We did it two years. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1430.42s)]
*  They have three issues that have. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1431.3799999999999s)]
*  I love that. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1432.82s)]
*  I can't even tell you you didn't. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1434.98s)]
*  I feel less safe. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1436.1s)]
*  And I feel stupid for feeling less safe. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1439.14s)]
*  I'm like, this guy told me to turn around. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1441.14s)]
*  There's no more rats. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1443.14s)]
*  The rats are gone. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1444.34s)]
*  Get all the rats out of here. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1445.78s)]
*  Well, they're indicators. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1446.98s)]
*  They're indicators of a success of a city. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1447.94s)]
*  And so you look at the financial, we have more jobs in New York in the city's history, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1452.42s)]
*  more small businesses in the city's history, double digits decrease in homicide, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1457.54s)]
*  shootings, the seven major crime categories, fourth largest tourism in the city history, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1462.1s)]
*  build more affordable housing in year one and year two, individual years in the city's history, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1466.98s)]
*  more people out of homelessness into permanent homes in year one and year two in the city's [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1473.14s)]
*  history. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1478.74s)]
*  Drop unemployment around all demographics in the city, but particularly black and [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1479.94s)]
*  hispanics by 20%. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1485.54s)]
*  So they're indicators that people look and see. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1487.38s)]
*  Let me see the success of the city. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1490.98s)]
*  When you look at the indicators, it shows how successful we are. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1492.58s)]
*  And bond ratings. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1497.3s)]
*  These people who look and say, OK, is this city being well managed so that we can give [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1498.18s)]
*  you a bond rating so that people see if they're going to invest in your city? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1502.34s)]
*  They raised my bond and then came back out of all that we went through. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1505.94s)]
*  They say, we still want to keep this bond rating high because this mayor has managed [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1511.7s)]
*  COVID, managed 230,000 migrants and asylum seekers that came into the city. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1516.3400000000001s)]
*  So they've watched how I manage this. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1523.06s)]
*  Just the bond thing is people can invest in cities. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1525.46s)]
*  They're called municipal bonds, right? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1528.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, a combination of bonds. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1529.94s)]
*  You have their industry bond rate is Fitch, S&P. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1531.06s)]
*  These are guys that look at your cities and say, OK, what are we going to say to our [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1536.82s)]
*  investors? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1542.26s)]
*  How well does this city be managed? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1542.98s)]
*  And the fact that the rating maintains high. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1545.22s)]
*  They say they scrutinize, they're hard, they look at everything, they how you manage your [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1548.18s)]
*  money. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1553.3s)]
*  And they said, this guy has managed this city. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1553.94s)]
*  You raised the city's credit score. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1556.66s)]
*  Take that, racists. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1558.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1559.8600000000001s)]
*  So tell us what happened with the migrant crisis. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1561.14s)]
*  Oh, great question. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1563.8600000000001s)]
*  Great question. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1564.58s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1566.74s)]
*  And that was my first I want to tell you three things that overshadowed our success. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1567.3s)]
*  And I want to talk about the migrants. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1572.5s)]
*  One, random acts of violence. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1574.34s)]
*  Nothing impacts your feeling of being unsafe. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1576.74s)]
*  You're a woman walking down a block, someone punches you in the face out of nowhere. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1579.7s)]
*  100%. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1582.58s)]
*  Random act of violence. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1583.38s)]
*  One guy dealing with severe mental health issues that should not have been on the street, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1584.58s)]
*  stabs three people. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1588.5s)]
*  Those shocked everyone. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1590.26s)]
*  That has overshadowed our success. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1593.46s)]
*  Mental health, that's tied to mental health. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1595.46s)]
*  The second is recidivism. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1597.14s)]
*  We have cats that are committing crimes repeatedly. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1600.1s)]
*  Repeatedly. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1603.86s)]
*  They made up their mind. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1604.74s)]
*  We have 575 people. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1605.86s)]
*  They picked up their money. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1608.02s)]
*  They don't break the law. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1608.98s)]
*  You put them in jail. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1610.1s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1611.14s)]
*  No, I'm committed to this. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1611.86s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1612.74s)]
*  Can't stop them. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1614.98s)]
*  You can't have 575 people who are arrested for shoplifting, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1616.26s)]
*  and they have been arrested over 7,500 times. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1622.1799999999998s)]
*  36 people who have assaulted people in the subway system have been arrested over 16 hundred times. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1625.3s)]
*  With this revolved indoor system and trying to convince our lawmakers in Albany, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1630.8999999999999s)]
*  that yo, this is a problem, you know? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1635.78s)]
*  And they're real problems. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1638.82s)]
*  So who can do that? [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1640.9799999999998s)]
*  I think a lot of people blame you for that as the mayor. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1642.26s)]
*  That's gotta be frustrating because you're like, yo, I'm not the DA. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1646.42s)]
*  You guys elected the DA. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1649.62s)]
*  It's not like you even placed them there. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1650.9s)]
*  The judges have to get on board, but there was a great deal of reform passed in Albany. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1656.26s)]
*  Conceptually, it was a great idea. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1664.02s)]
*  What was the concept? [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1665.7s)]
*  That was when you hear bail reform, discovery reform, raise the age reform. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1667.22s)]
*  There's a lot of reform because we don't want a heavy-handed criminal justice system [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1671.3s)]
*  when everyone is being locked up for no matter what they do. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1676.18s)]
*  You want to give people an opportunity to have a life after making a mistake. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1678.34s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1681.22s)]
*  But if they're repeat people, like you said, they're committed to that. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1681.7s)]
*  And that's what we're trying to show them, that listen, the data is showing these reforms you [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1684.34s)]
*  did in 2019 is having a negative impact on public safety, and it has been very centered [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1688.74s)]
*  on people who commit crimes. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1696.5s)]
*  But what about the people who are the victims of these crimes? [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1698.3400000000001s)]
*  We have to start talking about those who are victims of these crimes. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1701.54s)]
*  So what would your solution be? [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1705.3s)]
*  Because three strikes doesn't seem that fair either. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1706.5s)]
*  So what would your solution be? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1708.66s)]
*  It's not so much saying three strikes, two strikes. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1710.98s)]
*  The judges must use a determination. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1714.8200000000002s)]
*  Is it a danger releasing you? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1718.9s)]
*  Is it a danger releasing you? [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1721.22s)]
*  Judge has to make that call. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1723.0600000000002s)]
*  Is it a danger releasing you, putting you back in society? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1724.5s)]
*  If you're arrested in a short period of time for repeated burglary, repeated burglary, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1727.7s)]
*  you're making up your mind, listen, you can let me out as much as you want. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1732.66s)]
*  I'm going to continue to do the crime. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1736.26s)]
*  We have to prioritize law abiding citizens over the ones that are breaking the law. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1737.78s)]
*  The safety thereof. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1741.6200000000001s)]
*  And that's what we don't do. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1742.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1743.6200000000001s)]
*  That's what we don't do. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1743.8600000000001s)]
*  And I get the idea, like you said, like the idea was good. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1744.26s)]
*  Like you don't want too heavy handed a justice system where these people make mistakes and then [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1746.66s)]
*  they don't have opportunity in their life thereafter. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1750.3400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1752.18s)]
*  As you said, like as a young kid, you did some silly shit. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1752.5s)]
*  I know I did some silly shit. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1754.66s)]
*  We all did. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1755.54s)]
*  We did. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1756.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1756.82s)]
*  We were going to talk about it. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1757.38s)]
*  But we can. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1758.98s)]
*  A problem with that, a lot of people were doing like petty crimes and they didn't have money to [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1762.5800000000002s)]
*  bond out. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1766.42s)]
*  So they would just sit in jail for until they're caught. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1766.98s)]
*  So they're trying to solve that problem. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1769.6200000000001s)]
*  And that's why, and I'm a big believer in nonviolent crimes. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1771.38s)]
*  If you are- [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1776.18s)]
*  What do you mean you're a believer in it? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1777.22s)]
*  I'm a believer that we should not be being heavy handed. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1779.0600000000002s)]
*  With the nonviolent crimes. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1783.46s)]
*  Now, what we want to do is, hey, you have a drug problem. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1784.42s)]
*  You're going into Rite Aid over and over again and you're doing shoplifting. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1787.3000000000002s)]
*  Listen, we're going to give you a pathway to deal with that drug issue. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1790.66s)]
*  So we don't want to be heavy handed. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1794.8200000000002s)]
*  And those are the alternative to incarceration, give people the support they need. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1796.5s)]
*  Because a lot of people think, oh, okay, well shoplifting is a victimless crime. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1800.5800000000002s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1803.8600000000001s)]
*  If that Rite Aid closed down, Ms. Jones now has to get on the bus and go to get a drug store [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1805.54s)]
*  that's a mile away from her now. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1811.54s)]
*  That costs her money. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1814.18s)]
*  The people who worked in that Rite Aid are now losing their jobs in the same process. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1815.54s)]
*  It impacts your economy. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1820.18s)]
*  So we need to make sure that we send the right message that you can't have a revolving door system. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1822.26s)]
*  So let's talk about the migrants. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1828.8999999999999s)]
*  So out of nowhere, we started getting in a large flow of migrants. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1830.34s)]
*  Now, this is a city of immigrants. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1834.82s)]
*  And it's a city that has always been open to immigrants as a reason that the Statue of [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1837.78s)]
*  Liberty sits in our harbor. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1842.34s)]
*  Sanctuary city, right? [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1843.9399999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1845.22s)]
*  It's a sanctuary city. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1845.4599999999998s)]
*  Which is another separate issue. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1846.74s)]
*  I think what you're saying, like culturally, migrants aren't shocking to New Yorkers. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1848.34s)]
*  I always tell people this. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1851.62s)]
*  It's like, you can't even tell who the migrant is. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1852.58s)]
*  So we started getting in bus flows. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1856.5s)]
*  By design, right? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1859.4599999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1860.34s)]
*  This is a political play. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1860.82s)]
*  It was coming from Texas. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1862.1s)]
*  But it was the failure that we didn't secure our borders. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1863.54s)]
*  We were allowing everyone to come into the country with unsecured borders, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1866.98s)]
*  many gang members. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1871.46s)]
*  Very dangerous. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1872.66s)]
*  When I went down to Ecuador, Colombia, and Mexico to look at the flow, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1873.22s)]
*  there was a place called the Darien Gap. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1880.1000000000001s)]
*  So I went down there to see why people coming and try to explain to the government [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1881.7s)]
*  that New York City, the streets are not paved for gold. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1886.1000000000001s)]
*  Because everybody thinks you come to New York City, everything is fine. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1888.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's paved and ratchet. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1890.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1892.42s)]
*  So that might be a... [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1896.18s)]
*  Delicious meal. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1898.82s)]
*  Don't gross me out. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1904.8999999999999s)]
*  You gotta be careful with that one, either. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1905.3799999999999s)]
*  Don't gross me out. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1908.1799999999998s)]
*  It's vegan. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1911.06s)]
*  Okay, go ahead. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1913.3799999999999s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1914.1s)]
*  So people got upset because they said, man, what you doing? [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1914.58s)]
*  You letting everybody come into the city, you're paying for them. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1919.1399999999999s)]
*  Very reasonable. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1922.1799999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1922.8999999999999s)]
*  So what people didn't understand, I couldn't stop the buses from coming in. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1923.62s)]
*  The federal law said you can't, Eric. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1927.78s)]
*  I couldn't even allow them to work. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1929.94s)]
*  The federal law said you can't even allow them to work. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1931.78s)]
*  And a group of migrants and asylum seekers came to me and said, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1934.34s)]
*  listen, we want to contribute to the city. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1937.06s)]
*  Let us remove graffiti. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1939.22s)]
*  Let us clean the streets. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1940.74s)]
*  Give us a stipend. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1942.26s)]
*  Federal law said you can't even do that. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1943.1399999999999s)]
*  And the city law says everyone that comes here, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1945.78s)]
*  you must give them three meals a day. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1948.58s)]
*  You must house them. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1950.34s)]
*  That's the sanctuary city law. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1951.3799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1952.8999999999999s)]
*  But that wasn't built for migrants. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1953.1399999999999s)]
*  No, it wasn't. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1954.82s)]
*  It was built for our homeless population. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1955.3799999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1956.34s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1957.3000000000002s)]
*  Hoping that you would take people from homelessness, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1957.94s)]
*  you know, going through a rough time, and then they would be housed. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1960.5s)]
*  Without a doubt. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1963.0600000000002s)]
*  Over 40 years in existence. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1963.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1965.6200000000001s)]
*  And so- [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1965.94s)]
*  It's kind of unfortunate that that was taken advantage of like that. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1966.3400000000001s)]
*  And it was done, in my opinion, and I'd like to hear your opinions, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1968.66s)]
*  but I think it was like a political tool specifically done [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1972.74s)]
*  to make more liberal leaning cities seem uninhabitable. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1976.74s)]
*  I think the message was, because it should not happen to, [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1981.94s)]
*  when I went down to El Paso, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1984.18s)]
*  they should not have had to have gone through that. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1985.8600000000001s)]
*  No, they shouldn't either. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1987.8600000000001s)]
*  Brownsville, Texas, right. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1988.1000000000001s)]
*  No one should have to go through. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1990.26s)]
*  Growing up in Texas, they feel like New Yorkers, LA, or whatever, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1991.46s)]
*  they judge you a lot, especially New York, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1994.8200000000002s)]
*  but y'all don't deal with what we deal with. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1996.8200000000002s)]
*  Now see how you like it. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1998.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=1999.6200000000001s)]
*  I don't know if that's how immigrants affect them. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2000.1000000000001s)]
*  I think that's fair too. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2002.1000000000001s)]
*  It's like a lot of times New Yorkers, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2003.0600000000002s)]
*  or even people in like different parts of California, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2004.5800000000002s)]
*  but like these coastal elitist cities, they're just kind of like, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2006.98s)]
*  yeah, just don't, building a wall is bad. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2009.7s)]
*  Don't secure the border. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2011.94s)]
*  How dare you? [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2012.66s)]
*  We're not dealing with it. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2013.62s)]
*  So who are we to say what the issue is? [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2014.6599999999999s)]
*  And so where they went wrong, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2016.34s)]
*  where the governor of Texas went wrong, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2018.18s)]
*  is that we were saying, hey, we hear you. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2020.4199999999998s)]
*  Let's collaborate together and send that message. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2024.02s)]
*  Not just, listen, I'm not going to punish another municipality [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2026.5s)]
*  because the federal government is screwing up. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2029.86s)]
*  So when we reached out to them and said, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2032.18s)]
*  listen, we're on the same page with you. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2033.7s)]
*  Your city should not be going through this. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2035.3s)]
*  Let's get together. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2036.98s)]
*  Let's work together. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2037.86s)]
*  No, I just want to. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2039.1399999999999s)]
*  So now this is the dunk culture we're talking about. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2040.8999999999999s)]
*  Instead of having that dialogue and you coming together. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2043.46s)]
*  And I think at that moment, you were like a surrogate [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2046.1s)]
*  in the Biden administration. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2048.34s)]
*  Like you were somebody who was like working with them. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2049.22s)]
*  You were hand chosen, by the way. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2051.54s)]
*  It's not like everybody's a surrogate. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2053.06s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2054.58s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2055.22s)]
*  You want one of the most powerful positions in the country, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2055.62s)]
*  the mayor of New York on your side, if you're the administration. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2057.7s)]
*  So you're like, if you go and extend yourself to a conservative governor [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2060.34s)]
*  and say, let's work together and they go, no, thank you. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2065.2999999999997s)]
*  We're going to send the buses. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2068.42s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2069.46s)]
*  That's a bullshit. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2070.02s)]
*  I don't like wheels. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2071.38s)]
*  Not a fan. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2072.6600000000003s)]
*  And so we lost an opportunity because when I went down to El Paso [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2073.86s)]
*  and I saw people sleeping on the streets and airports, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2080.26s)]
*  I said, this is not right even for El Paso. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2082.82s)]
*  My position was no city should take on a federal responsibility. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2085.1400000000003s)]
*  And that was my advocacy. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2089.78s)]
*  I went to Washington 10 times to speak with the lawmakers. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2091.2200000000003s)]
*  I met with the president twice, President Biden twice around this issue. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2094.5800000000004s)]
*  And his people, they were giving him misinformation. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2098.98s)]
*  They were not being honest to him. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2102.9s)]
*  Who were his people? [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2104.42s)]
*  That's, I think, yeah, who were his people? [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2105.7s)]
*  There were several people who was close that was in charge of this issue [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2108.66s)]
*  that was supposed to be giving him the right information. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2113.14s)]
*  And I told them, I said, Mr. President. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2116.02s)]
*  Maybe they told him and he just forgot. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2118.02s)]
*  He was a little old, you know what I mean? [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2119.62s)]
*  Possible. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2121.3s)]
*  No, but I'm just curious about these people because that's what we've heard a lot about [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2122.66s)]
*  sometimes with the Biden administration. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2127.38s)]
*  I don't want to make this like a political thing, but like just this idea that [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2128.82s)]
*  maybe there were other people that were in his ear or making certain decisions [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2132.7400000000002s)]
*  that he might not have been privy to. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2136.34s)]
*  Because if you spoke to him and he seemed like an amicable, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2138.1s)]
*  nice guy who was understanding of what's going on, like where's the disconnect here? [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2140.98s)]
*  You know, what's interesting in government, particularly on the federal level, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2145.78s)]
*  people have their own agendas as well. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2150.58s)]
*  And there was so much going on back then of people pushing back on the concept. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2153.62s)]
*  There are some people with a philosophy that our borders should be open [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2159.86s)]
*  and everyone should be able to come in no matter what. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2163.14s)]
*  I don't believe in that. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2166.1s)]
*  As part of government? [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2166.82s)]
*  Right. Here's what I said to the administration. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2168.02s)]
*  I said, listen, no one should, right now people are coming into the country, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2170.74s)]
*  not knowing anyone in the country, not knowing where they're going. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2176.02s)]
*  I said, listen, we're having in our country, we're having population problems. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2178.9s)]
*  There are a lot of cities that are dealing with population issues. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2182.1s)]
*  Let's tell people, we're going to tell you where you're going to go for three years. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2185.62s)]
*  If Kentucky needs people to be backstretch workers, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2190.58s)]
*  to work in the racing industry, you're going to Kentucky. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2194.02s)]
*  After you do your three years, then you can go anywhere in the country and apply. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2197.7s)]
*  This way we're connecting your need to be in America with the need that America needs. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2201.06s)]
*  It's a fantastic idea. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2206.02s)]
*  And we're controlling the flow. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2207.14s)]
*  You're not coming in and view part of a gang, which they were doing. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2209.6200000000003s)]
*  They say, hey, the border's open. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2214.26s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2215.86s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a break for a second because I want to make sure that your energy is [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2216.42s)]
*  up whenever you need it. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2219.94s)]
*  And you know who's going to do that? [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2223.1400000000003s)]
*  America. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2225.3s)]
*  America in a can. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2226.1000000000004s)]
*  Veteran owned. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2227.38s)]
*  That's right. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2228.6600000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2229.6200000000003s)]
*  Veterans came back from defending our freedoms and they said, you know what America needs? [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2230.34s)]
*  America needs to enjoy this country for more hours of the day. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2236.1s)]
*  They went to these other places. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2239.54s)]
*  They're like, these places suck. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2240.9s)]
*  I get why they sleep all the time, take a little siesta, do whatever. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2242.18s)]
*  But America is so incredible. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2245.7s)]
*  We're going to help Americans enjoy more hours of the day. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2247.7s)]
*  How do we do that? [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2251.06s)]
*  Obviously, you have the Black Rifle coffee, but now you have Black Rifle energy. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2251.86s)]
*  Some of you don't like coffee. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2254.74s)]
*  I get it. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2256.2599999999998s)]

*  You will grow up one day. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2259.62s)]
*  This right here, the Black Rifle energy. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2261.7s)]
*  Absolutely fantastic. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2263.94s)]
*  Project Mango, right? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2265.06s)]
*  Probably some of those veterans went on that project. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2266.42s)]
*  We don't have to talk about the details, but there's a lot of things they probably did. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2268.2599999999998s)]
*  Maybe destabilize the nation because we needed to get the mango rights to a certain. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2271.14s)]
*  I'm not going to get into it. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2275.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2276.34s)]
*  This is not about politics right now. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2277.14s)]
*  My point that I'm trying to make is the Black Rifle guys, they are coffee connoisseurs. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2280.1s)]
*  They are getting the best beans in the world. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2284.74s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2287.46s)]

*  So they're looking for reprieve from the gang violence. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2414.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2416.74s)]
*  And then they came here to New York. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2417.3s)]
*  And they were like, they over here too. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2419.7s)]
*  Gotcha. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2425.06s)]
*  And that's what happened. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2427.38s)]
*  People were like, when I go, because I spent the night in a migrant asylum seeker shelter, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2428.18s)]
*  one of our shelters, I spent the night to talk to them and find out, you know, why did you flee? [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2433.86s)]
*  What are you going through? [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2437.86s)]
*  They say the gangs are here. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2439.1400000000003s)]
*  They're preying on us. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2440.58s)]
*  And so when I say that, listen, you're a gang member, you're a recognizable terrorist, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2442.02s)]
*  you commit crimes, you can't be here. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2447.2200000000003s)]
*  You cannot prey on migrants and you cannot prey on everyday Americans. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2450.58s)]
*  You can't be here. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2455.06s)]
*  So now people want to say, this is what's really deep because so much politics is in play. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2455.78s)]
*  People say, oh, you anti-immigrant, anti-immigrant. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2460.5s)]
*  I got the national immigrant leaders, the national people who fight this nationally. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2463.78s)]
*  I said, I want you to come to the city and see what I'm doing. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2469.1400000000003s)]
*  They said, we want to come here because you anti-immigrant. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2471.38s)]
*  We don't want to come. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2473.46s)]
*  We don't want to talk to you. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2474.02s)]
*  And I said, well, at least come. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2475.2200000000003s)]
*  They came to the city. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2477.3s)]
*  They spent the day with Anna D.A. Almanzar, the first Dominican deputy mayor in the history of [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2478.34s)]
*  the city. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2484.5s)]
*  They came, spent the day with her. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2485.7000000000003s)]
*  They met me at Gracie Mansion, had dinner. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2488.34s)]
*  They say, we got to apologize to you. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2490.98s)]
*  Wow. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2493.06s)]
*  They said, no one in the country is doing what you're doing. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2494.1800000000003s)]
*  We're going to write a letter to Washington and say, the country needs to follow your model. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2497.94s)]
*  We fed, housed, clothed, educated 40,000 children, put people on the pathway for citizenship. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2504.26s)]
*  What we did with 230,000 people, 190,000 have left Alcantara and went on to the next journey. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2512.82s)]
*  What we did, no one in the country was doing. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2518.82s)]
*  But when you pick up the papers, you walk away and say, oh, this guy hate immigrants. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2521.7000000000003s)]
*  This guy's anti-immigrant. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2525.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2527.2200000000003s)]
*  But I think that's one of those things where it's very easy politicized. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2528.02s)]
*  Like, I got frustrated at that too. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2531.46s)]
*  All of us are kids of immigrants on this podcast, like every single one of us. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2533.3s)]
*  So this idea that we are not supportive of immigration is kind of absurd. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2536.7400000000002s)]
*  Also, coming in New York, you've heard those criticisms in New York. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2541.3s)]
*  You're like, what the fuck are you talking about? [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2544.1000000000004s)]
*  Somebody from Maine is going to tell me about immigrants. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2546.1800000000003s)]
*  I'm a New York immigrant. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2549.1400000000003s)]
*  If anything, you almost hear the opposite where it's like, oh, they're putting migrants in hotels [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2551.1400000000003s)]
*  and they're putting them up and they're taking over city blocks. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2554.1s)]
*  So it's almost the opposite where it's almost too accommodative. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2556.98s)]
*  That was the... [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2560.1s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2560.6600000000003s)]
*  And that's what I was saying. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2560.9s)]
*  But that... [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2562.26s)]
*  I don't even know what I'm talking about there. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2562.7400000000002s)]
*  Which is... so it's like you either hate immigrants or they're staying at the Four Seasons. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2563.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2566.98s)]
*  Right? [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2567.38s)]
*  But I think that was the thing that New Yorkers started to give pushback, which is like New [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2567.78s)]
*  Yorkers, obviously struggling, cost of living has gone up. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2571.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2575.6200000000003s)]
*  Like you were saying housing prices are crazy. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2576.02s)]
*  And then you're hearing these stories about these people that are migrating to New York, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2578.42s)]
*  right? [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2581.94s)]
*  And they're getting put up at the hotel outside of Madison Square Garden, getting three meals [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2582.5s)]
*  a day. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2585.86s)]
*  You're like, yo, my kid's getting two meals a day. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2586.1000000000004s)]
*  So you understand their concern and resentment. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2588.6600000000003s)]
*  Without a doubt. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2590.6600000000003s)]
*  Without a doubt. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2591.38s)]
*  And you're in this situation where you're like, okay, the federal government is not [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2592.26s)]
*  helping me with this situation at all. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2596.7400000000002s)]
*  And I'm shackled by my limitations as a city to even put these people to work or do anything. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2598.9s)]
*  So now the center of the federal government, through law, is making me put them up and [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2604.5s)]
*  feed them at the potential disadvantage to my own constituents. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2610.1800000000003s)]
*  And then you just got to sit there and take it. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2614.1s)]
*  And what you just stated... and here's the impact of this. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2615.46s)]
*  This is what's deep about this moment. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2619.2200000000003s)]
*  That they were not standing... they were standing in tents. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2622.1800000000003s)]
*  Randall's Island. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2626.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2627.62s)]
*  Creedmoor. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2629.7000000000003s)]
*  We put up a tent. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2630.9s)]
*  Floyd Benefield. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2631.62s)]
*  Tents. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2632.6600000000003s)]
*  I went to go to these tents. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2633.06s)]
*  Now, it was the best we could do in the circumstances. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2634.34s)]
*  Roosevelt Hotel was our intake center. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2637.86s)]
*  So you go to Roosevelt first and then you go to... [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2640.82s)]
*  You'll go to one of these other locations. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2643.14s)]
*  Gotcha. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2644.98s)]
*  But once the narrative hits the news, you go to Nick Game, sit in courtside, and migrate [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2645.3s)]
*  to America and sit in courtside and fight. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2650.6600000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2652.5s)]
*  And that was not the reality. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2652.7400000000002s)]
*  But then, this is how... this is what angered me. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2654.9s)]
*  This was the tipping point where I decided I got to publicly criticize the administration, [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2658.02s)]
*  the Biden administration. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2663.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2664.2599999999998s)]
*  When did that happen? [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2664.74s)]
*  Because that was very brave, I thought. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2665.62s)]
*  The money... this cost us $7 billion. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2667.7s)]
*  Now, we have a fixed budget. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2672.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2675.86s)]
*  We have a fixed budget. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2676.82s)]
*  Just think about if you're a homeowner and you take... [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2679.38s)]
*  and you have your budget to do your lights, your gas, your budget for your repairs. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2682.34s)]
*  All of a sudden, the roof caves in, you want your insurance company coming to give you... [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2687.46s)]
*  You think that's very reasonable? [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2690.7400000000002s)]
*  And if the insurance company tells you, hey, we're not giving you anything, [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2691.94s)]
*  now you got to take it out of somewhere. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2696.1s)]
*  So I had to take $7 billion out of the services for our city. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2698.1s)]
*  The long-term impact of that is what troubles me. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2705.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2708.98s)]
*  That's the... because I could have taken $200 million of that to go to chronically [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2709.2200000000003s)]
*  absent children, because we had a lot of children that are chronically absent after COVID. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2714.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2718.2599999999998s)]
*  I could have taken $500 million and went to my adult care. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2718.5s)]
*  I could have... [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2722.66s)]
*  And what you're saying is that this is a federal issue. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2723.22s)]
*  The federal government is responsible for protecting the borders of this country. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2725.54s)]
*  You are dealing with their lack of effort to protect the country. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2729.3799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2735.2999999999997s)]
*  And they're going, but you also got to pay for it. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2735.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2737.4599999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I understand what that feels. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2738.02s)]
*  And you know what their response after going there all the time? [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2739.2999999999997s)]
*  What? [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2741.8599999999997s)]
*  They say, Eric, this is like a gold bladder. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2742.26s)]
*  It's going to hurt now, but in the past. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2744.5s)]
*  I said, then you piss it out. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2747.1400000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2752.7400000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2753.2200000000003s)]
*  So listen, and I don't want to get conspiratorial. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2753.7000000000003s)]
*  I don't want to get conspiratorial, but after you come out, and I thought, [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2755.7000000000003s)]
*  like very reasonably criticize them, right? [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2760.26s)]
*  A little bit afterwards, all of a sudden, the Justice Department looks into Eric Adams. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2763.0600000000004s)]
*  Now listen, I don't want to get conspiratorial here. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2768.42s)]
*  I do. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2771.6200000000003s)]
*  But we're going to get conspiratorial. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2772.18s)]
*  They look into Eric Adams, and then they, and there's this thing about Turkish airlines, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2774.74s)]
*  right? [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2779.14s)]
*  Which I think that they were targeting you because you're bald, [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2779.3799999999997s)]
*  and maybe you're going to get the airline. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2781.46s)]
*  And I wear earrings. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2782.3399999999997s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2783.14s)]
*  It's discriminatory. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2784.66s)]
*  So this is what bothered me the most. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2785.54s)]
*  It was the dollar amount. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2788.3399999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2789.62s)]
*  If you are being corrupted, it better be more than a hundred fucking thousand dollars. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2790.3399999999997s)]
*  Please God. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2795.22s)]
*  Now listen, I know there's level of corruption in government all over the place, [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2796.2599999999998s)]
*  but if you were the mayor of New York City, have some fucking respect for yourself. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2798.8199999999997s)]
*  Shut about it. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2801.86s)]
*  It's got to be 20 million or something. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2802.5s)]
*  What is it? [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2805.1400000000003s)]
*  So can you, do you think there's any connection to those two things? [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2806.02s)]
*  You're darn right I do. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2809.1400000000003s)]
*  The timing of it, the leaking, the public embarrassment and humiliation. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2811.1400000000003s)]
*  They were leaking information part of the case. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2817.7000000000003s)]
*  They were just leaking it out. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2820.02s)]
*  Grand jury testimonies are supposed to be private and secret. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2822.42s)]
*  And then all of a sudden they start. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2825.94s)]
*  Ending up in the same paper over and over again. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2828.5s)]
*  The New York Times over and over again, over and over again. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2830.74s)]
*  So a lot of people never read the indictment. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2833.54s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2837.06s)]
*  Anyway, keep going. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2838.02s)]
*  Yeah, they never read the indictment. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2838.66s)]
*  The whole premise of their indictment. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2840.18s)]
*  I was the borough president at the time. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2843.7799999999997s)]
*  The Turkish embassy was going to open. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2845.9399999999996s)]
*  The president was coming. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2848.4199999999996s)]
*  And they were going through the bureaucracy, the madness of it. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2850.3399999999997s)]
*  And if you've ever built a thing or renovated in this fucking city. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2854.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2857.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2858.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2858.3399999999997s)]
*  And I ran on the platform that government must be more fluid and it can't be bureaucratic. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2858.98s)]
*  I called the fire commissioner and said, can you at least go do an inspection? [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2867.14s)]
*  Can somebody go do an inspection so that they can see, they can pass the inspection? [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2872.34s)]
*  And I said, if you can't do it, let me know and I'll manage their expectation. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2877.46s)]
*  All of this is in the indictment. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2881.62s)]
*  Let me know and I'll manage their expectation. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2883.62s)]
*  I didn't tell them to go past them. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2885.86s)]
*  I didn't tell them go past the rules, ignore it. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2887.46s)]
*  I said, no, just go to a door and inspection. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2890.1s)]
*  The guy's asking for an inspection. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2892.18s)]
*  So they said, well, you know what? [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2893.94s)]
*  The federal government said, well, they gave you upgrades throughout the years. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2896.42s)]
*  And we're going to attach that to when you call them and say you were bribed. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2901.86s)]
*  Upgrades on a flight. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2906.18s)]
*  On a plane. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2907.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2907.62s)]
*  On a plane and say that you were bribed. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2908.02s)]
*  They use all of these numbers. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2910.18s)]
*  For upgrades. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2912.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2913.62s)]
*  So you buy a regular coach class ticket, but the fact that you get bumped up means you're in their pocket. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2914.7599999999998s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2921.08s)]
*  Why did you get bumped up? [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2922.12s)]
*  Because I didn't know that secret. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2923.3199999999997s)]
*  Who hasn't flown? [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2926.68s)]
*  Who would like coach the turkeys? [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2929.96s)]
*  Who hasn't flown and said, I mean, tell me someone who hasn't flown and said, hey, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2931.96s)]
*  I see you got an empty seat in business. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2938.2799999999997s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2940.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2941.88s)]
*  You know, but to take down a city mayor of the largest city in America. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2942.2s)]
*  And then when you looked at the text messages that were leaked a few weeks ago of them talking [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2950.68s)]
*  about it and hey, you know, the US attorney, he may have a political agenda here. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2955.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2961.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2961.8799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2962.04s)]
*  They found their text messages and their communications. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2962.2799999999997s)]
*  So it exposed their agenda. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2965.7999999999997s)]
*  And that gets leaked by whom? [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2969.56s)]
*  No, they, the judge ordered it to be released. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2971.5600000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2974.6800000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2975.4s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2975.6400000000003s)]
*  The judge ordered it to be released. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2976.2000000000003s)]
*  But you know, if you really want to... [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2977.96s)]
*  And they dropped this case, right? [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2980.36s)]
*  Like, well, nobody will prosecute it. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2981.6400000000003s)]
*  The US attorney said it was a weak case. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2983.8s)]
*  The new incoming US attorney said it was a weak case. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2986.76s)]
*  They put in to have it dismissed. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2989.6400000000003s)]
*  The judge said, basically, I don't want to dismiss it on my own opinion. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2991.8s)]
*  Let me get an independent person to look over and make a determination what I need to do. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=2998.76s)]
*  That independent person came back three weeks ago and said, you need to dismiss this case. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3005.0800000000004s)]
*  And so we're now waiting for the judge to look at what his independent person said. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3009.8s)]
*  We believe he should agree with the independent person. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3015.7200000000003s)]
*  What he said, listen, I did nothing wrong. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3018.36s)]
*  How do you... [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3020.28s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3020.92s)]
*  I lived a public life for over 40 years. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3021.8s)]
*  And I know that, listen, everyone in New York, [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3024.6800000000003s)]
*  you're scrutinizing and watch. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3027.08s)]
*  I know I lived my life. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3029.16s)]
*  I did nothing wrong. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3030.44s)]
*  This was traumatizing to my family. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3032.44s)]
*  But you're in public life. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3035.56s)]
*  You have to fight hard. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3036.52s)]
*  Now, the real test for me was 15 months ago when the indictment came down, [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3037.64s)]
*  I could have easily said, you know what, let me just... [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3043.88s)]
*  I resign. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3046.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3046.84s)]
*  People would say, oh, you need to resign. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3047.48s)]
*  I was like, I'm not going anywhere. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3049.0s)]
*  I did nothing wrong. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3050.12s)]
*  People were leaving you, right? [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3050.92s)]
*  People were leaving you aside. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3052.12s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3053.0s)]
*  Now what are they going to do? [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3053.96s)]
*  You know, that's how true folks are. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3055.7200000000003s)]
*  Because who else would hire somebody that left at the first sign of trouble? [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3058.2000000000003s)]
*  Listen, look, I don't know your spiritual belief, [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3063.88s)]
*  but my belief is clear. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3067.0s)]
*  God is good, man. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3068.2000000000003s)]
*  You know that? [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3069.2400000000002s)]
*  All the time. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3069.8s)]
*  God, God, and all the time, God is good. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3070.36s)]
*  Look at you, man. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3072.36s)]
*  Sounding like a Baptist preacher. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3074.76s)]
*  So, you know, but we have delivered in the midst of that. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3079.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3082.28s)]
*  But it is a shot at your political career. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3083.34s)]
*  Is it frustrating to not, or do you know who you think it came from? [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3087.1000000000004s)]
*  Like, is Biden aware of this, or is it the people that are like underneath Biden? [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3092.5400000000004s)]
*  Is it completely separate from the... [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3096.94s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3098.5400000000004s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3099.26s)]
*  You know, there are a lot of people, you know, this... [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3100.2200000000003s)]
*  You know, and I don't want to sound conspiracy theory, [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3103.5800000000004s)]
*  but there's a permanent government. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3106.86s)]
*  There are people that see presidents and mayors come and go. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3108.78s)]
*  Their attitudes will wait you out, you know? [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3112.3s)]
*  You know what book is a great book, man? [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3115.02s)]
*  Everybody should read the book. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3116.78s)]
*  Cash Patel's Government Gangsters. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3117.98s)]
*  Okay. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3122.38s)]
*  You should read that book, man. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3125.02s)]
*  Cash breaks this down. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3127.26s)]
*  What is it? [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3128.86s)]
*  And is this what some... [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3129.34s)]
*  He's now the FBI director. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3130.0600000000004s)]
*  Of course, of course. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3132.1400000000003s)]
*  We like Cash. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3132.7000000000003s)]
*  But is this like what people refer to? [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3133.98s)]
*  And I think this word has been used too much, [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3137.02s)]
*  but like the deep state or whatever it is. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3138.86s)]
*  It's not used too much. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3141.1800000000003s)]
*  It's real, brother. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3142.94s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3143.7400000000002s)]
*  Brother, think about it. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3144.2200000000003s)]
*  Who's part of it? [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3146.78s)]
*  Like what are their current senators and that kind of stuff? [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3147.5800000000004s)]
*  Or is it people that we don't even know, [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3150.78s)]
*  but they're always existing? [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3152.38s)]
*  You know, I have never seen anyone do such a good job [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3153.5800000000004s)]
*  of defining that deep state. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3157.82s)]
*  You should have him on. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3160.2200000000003s)]
*  I would love to. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3161.1000000000004s)]
*  Do you want to tell him to come on? [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3161.82s)]
*  You should have him on. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3163.1000000000004s)]
*  We would love it. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3164.46s)]
*  The way he... [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3165.1800000000003s)]
*  He's probably listening right now, right? [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3166.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3167.82s)]
*  Cash. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3169.04s)]
*  The way... [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3171.2000000000003s)]
*  Because he was in. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3172.0s)]
*  It's like me talking about what happens in NYPD after 22 years. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3173.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3176.56s)]
*  Cash was in the DOD. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3177.28s)]
*  He was in the FBI. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3179.2000000000003s)]
*  He prosecuted terrorists. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3180.6400000000003s)]
*  So he comes with this wealth of knowledge. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3182.1600000000003s)]
*  And the way he breaks it down, it's just unbelievable [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3184.4s)]
*  what this deep state is about and why it's so important for Americans [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3188.96s)]
*  that we cannot have a weaponizing of our prosecutorial powers. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3195.04s)]
*  Imagine the Southern District, right? [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3201.12s)]
*  Southern District of New York. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3202.64s)]
*  That's one of the most powerful U.S. Attorneys Office. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3203.6s)]
*  In their mind, they say, we're sovereign. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3207.04s)]
*  You know what that means? [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3210.72s)]
*  What do you mean they said they're sovereign? [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3212.56s)]
*  They don't have to answer to anyone. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3214.56s)]
*  Oh. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3215.7599999999998s)]
*  They don't have to answer to the president. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3216.24s)]
*  They don't have to answer to the U.S. Attorney in Washington, [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3217.6s)]
*  Attorney General in Washington. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3220.4s)]
*  They believe they're a sovereign entity. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3221.7599999999998s)]
*  You're not elected. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3224.32s)]
*  Imagine an entity believing they don't have to answer to anyone. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3227.2s)]
*  This is you have to answer to the people. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3231.04s)]
*  And ultimately, the people that we put in power. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3232.64s)]
*  I'm curious. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3237.2s)]
*  What do you say to people saying that Trump played a role in the DOJ dropping the case? [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3237.68s)]
*  Because it's like it kind of looked like you went to my law go. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3242.88s)]
*  And then all of a sudden. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3245.92s)]
*  He had your back at that Catholic dinner. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3246.72s)]
*  I'm glad you said that. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3249.84s)]
*  And I thought that that was like a really interesting thing to even say. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3251.36s)]
*  He said it kind of flippantly. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3255.04s)]
*  Which I thought was more effective because he could have [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3256.64s)]
*  win and made a big deal of it. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3259.2s)]
*  He was like, it's wrong what they're doing. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3260.32s)]
*  And I've always wondered if he felt people are going to say we're [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3262.08s)]
*  apologizing for Trump or whatever. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3264.96s)]
*  But I've always wondered if he felt like, oh, they're doing the same thing to him. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3266.32s)]
*  Come on, brother. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3272.2400000000002s)]
*  You tell me. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3273.28s)]
*  Come on. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3273.92s)]
*  Come on. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3274.4s)]
*  Listen, people say this is what they with those who are have [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3275.04s)]
*  Trump derangement syndrome are saying. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3280.16s)]
*  Because there's some folks, I'm not the type of cat that I respect the office. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3282.48s)]
*  The presidency is in office, is representative of our country. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3288.48s)]
*  Presidents come and go, like mayors come and go. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3294.24s)]
*  I'm a big believer. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3296.88s)]
*  I'm a patriot. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3297.92s)]
*  I believe in the American flag. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3299.52s)]
*  My uncle died at 19 defending this country. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3303.04s)]
*  I wore a bulletproof vest for the city. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3307.44s)]
*  My brother did as well. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3309.2s)]
*  So I believe in the symbol of office. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3310.64s)]
*  So I don't have to like who's in office. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3312.8799999999997s)]
*  I respected Biden to the fullest extent. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3315.8399999999997s)]
*  I respect the office. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3318.56s)]
*  And so when President Trump was on a campaign trail before he was elected, [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3319.9199999999996s)]
*  he was saying, look what they're doing to this man in New York. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3326.16s)]
*  He said, this is wrong what they're doing to this man in New York. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3328.3999999999996s)]
*  He never asked me for anything. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3330.8799999999997s)]
*  I believe he personally saw what they did to, [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3332.7999999999997s)]
*  is one thing to do something to the individual. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3336.0s)]
*  But when you start doing something to your family members, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3338.32s)]
*  and I think there was something he saw, [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3341.2000000000003s)]
*  because of everything he had on his campaign trail, [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3343.36s)]
*  he didn't have to come out on his campaign trail [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3345.84s)]
*  and say this is wrong what they're doing to Eric. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3347.52s)]
*  They did it at rallies. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3349.04s)]
*  He did it the day before the election, [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3350.7200000000003s)]
*  when he's at Madison Square Garden, a few days before the election, [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3352.48s)]
*  on that Sunday. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3355.1200000000003s)]
*  He said, look what they're doing to this man in New York. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3356.0s)]
*  So there was never, they say, well, there was a quid pro quo. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3359.04s)]
*  You are now trying to be hard on immigration. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3362.88s)]
*  I said, show me what I said after he was elected, [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3367.36s)]
*  that I wasn't saying before he was elected. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3372.56s)]
*  The same thing I was saying before he was elected. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3375.28s)]
*  You commit a crime, you need to get out of our country. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3377.52s)]
*  That's the same thing that I've been saying. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3380.32s)]
*  And let me just drop this on you, [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3382.48s)]
*  that a lot of people don't realize. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3383.6s)]
*  ICE is a law enforcement organization. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3387.44s)]
*  I'm not going to say, I'm not going to corroborate [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3392.08s)]
*  with any law enforcement organization to keep our city safe. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3394.56s)]
*  Now you make people not like ICE, that's your opinion. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3398.64s)]
*  But it's a law enforcement organization. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3401.44s)]
*  That's not criminalize a law enforcement organization. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3403.04s)]
*  And there's some people coming into the country to commit crimes. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3406.96s)]
*  But you had it vocal, like when you were in the police force, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3410.7999999999997s)]
*  which I thought was admirable, you were vocal against Amadou Diallo, [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3413.6s)]
*  I think is how he calls it. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3417.04s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3417.92s)]
*  Which is a brave thing to do because what happened to him was fucked. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3418.24s)]
*  But to the same end, if you think what ICE is doing right now, [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3420.72s)]
*  deporting guys with green cards and all that, I assume that would be ICE, [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3424.8799999999997s)]
*  you would also speak up against ICE. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3428.08s)]
*  You're right. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3429.9199999999996s)]
*  Well, our city, this is some good stuff for your listeners. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3430.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3435.3599999999997s)]
*  Our city is not allowed by law to collaborate with ICE for any civil enforcement. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3435.8399999999997s)]

*  Got it. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3450.72s)]
*  If somebody's committing a crime, we can collaborate them. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3451.04s)]
*  We have joint task forces with FBI, Homeland Security, all these entities [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3454.48s)]

*  So point is, stake has got your back. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3796.32s)]
*  If you want to go gamble, obviously you're going to gamble on the Yankees. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3798.32s)]
*  The Yankees are crushing it. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3800.48s)]
*  Are we going to win whatever the championship in baseball is? [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3801.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3804.2400000000002s)]
*  The World Series. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3806.4s)]
*  What are you going to call it? [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3807.04s)]
*  The World Bowl. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3807.52s)]
*  Are we going to win the World Bowl? [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3808.32s)]
*  Are we going to win the Super World Bowl? [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3809.92s)]
*  Yes, we are. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3811.84s)]
*  Okay? [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3812.8s)]
*  Just like we have all throughout our childhood. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3813.36s)]
*  This is what we do. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3815.84s)]
*  Greatest city in the entire world. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3816.7200000000003s)]
*  Can we get back to the show? [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3817.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3818.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3819.2000000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3819.44s)]
*  We cannot ignore the Trump part of this because what Biden's Justice Department did was unbelievable. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3819.92s)]
*  You place mothers on FBI watch lists because you are worried about what they're being taught to children in school. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3831.36s)]
*  Wait, what is that? [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3840.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3841.04s)]
*  They had mothers and families placed on FBI watch lists, terrorist watch lists, [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3841.92s)]
*  because of their advocacy around some of the things that they're teaching their children in school. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3848.0s)]
*  They wanted to call them terrorists. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3853.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm telling you, you got to see what that Justice Department did. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3855.68s)]
*  And a lot of people want to ignore what, they talk about my case. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3858.24s)]
*  But when Biden pardoned his son, he said, he said, the Justice Department has been politicized. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3862.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3871.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3871.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3871.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3872.64s)]
*  That was a big... [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3872.96s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3873.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3874.08s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3874.64s)]
*  We're not like Biden people, Biden's people. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3875.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3878.48s)]
*  It's like, it is a tricky thing because I'm pardoning my kid 100% if I have that power, [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3880.08s)]
*  but at the same time, I understand the frustration that you must absolutely feel. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3884.56s)]
*  Okay. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3889.36s)]
*  And we're not hearing... [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3889.92s)]
*  We're not hearing... [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3890.88s)]
*  No one from... [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3892.88s)]
*  We're trying to hear the same criticism. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3893.36s)]
*  No one from the Justice Department quit. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3894.32s)]
*  None of them said, I think what you're doing is wrong, so I'm quitting. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3897.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3900.88s)]
*  You know, I'm telling you, read Cash's book. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3901.52s)]
*  This is the thing that I think is really frustrating. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3905.52s)]
*  Is it like, we know your name, we know Biden's name, we know Hunter's name, we know Trump's name. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3908.1600000000003s)]
*  These people that you were talking about or Cash was talking about, none of us know their names. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3914.5600000000004s)]
*  You want to know the name in the books. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3918.5600000000004s)]
*  Okay. I'm going to look because like, how can we hold people accountable that were not [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3919.76s)]
*  elected by us, not democratically chosen, and are the ones allegedly behind these decisions, [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3925.2799999999997s)]
*  but how can we hold them accountable? We don't know who the fuck they are. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3930.8799999999997s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3932.96s)]
*  And why do you feel... Why are you telling me? You know the names. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3933.8399999999997s)]
*  Are you scared? [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3938.16s)]
*  I don't know. No, no. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3938.72s)]
*  Dyslexia, baby. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3939.6s)]
*  No, no. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3940.48s)]
*  On your book. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3941.12s)]
*  No, when you read the book, I don't remember all the names as they listed. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3943.52s)]
*  He did a good job of documenting some of the case history of documenting, [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3947.68s)]
*  so I can't blurt out every name when I remember, but it's all in the book. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3952.32s)]
*  He does an amazing job of documenting the case history. Like you look at the... [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3956.96s)]
*  Which case? [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3963.52s)]
*  Cases. There's a couple of cases. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3965.52s)]
*  Got it, got it, got it. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3966.7200000000003s)]
*  Like he goes into what was happening in the Justice Department under the previous administration, [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3967.6000000000004s)]
*  and how the number of people who were under investigation were just political people. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3976.72s)]
*  I mean the book is a good book. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3983.2s)]
*  Do you get a nudge, like when you start speaking out? [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3985.2s)]
*  Yes. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3988.24s)]
*  Do you get like a private phone call from somebody or an email that goes, [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3989.12s)]
*  hey, why don't we go a different direction about this? It might not be good for you politically. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3993.04s)]
*  Does that happen? [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3997.04s)]
*  What people told me, people told me when I criticized what was happening to our city [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=3998.16s)]
*  around the migrants and the silent seekers, they said, Eric, they got many ways to come at you. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4004.16s)]
*  Really? [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4010.72s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4011.52s)]
*  And is this commonplace within politics? Like did you experience this at Borough [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4012.24s)]
*  President when you had strong opinions? Were you like, hey, if you go against [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4016.72s)]
*  the administration, the mayoral administration, they might come down on you? [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4019.9199999999996s)]
*  Is this just how politics works, or is this something specific to like federal government [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4024.16s)]
*  and control? [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4028.64s)]
*  I think it's a combination of, people weaponize their authority in every business. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4029.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4035.6s)]
*  It's not just unique to politics. It becomes more costly when you're using prosecutors [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4035.92s)]
*  as a weapon against political opponents. I mean, I'm facing 35 years in jail. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4046.2400000000002s)]
*  No. Wow. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4057.28s)]
*  Think about it. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4058.32s)]
*  I didn't know. Think about it. And it cost me over $3 million. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4058.8s)]
*  Personally. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4068.1600000000003s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4068.8s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4070.0800000000004s)]
*  So think about this for a moment. You know what I'm saying? This is real shit. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4070.7200000000003s)]
*  So these people would 100% be totally fine with you being behind bars for 35 years, [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4075.6000000000004s)]
*  completely broke, just so that they could send a message to other states not to push back. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4082.88s)]
*  Make an example. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4089.44s)]
*  Yeah. Read Cash's book. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4090.2400000000002s)]
*  Have you spoken about this outside of this podcast? [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4094.48s)]
*  This is the most difficult moment for me for the last 15 months, [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4099.76s)]
*  because everybody knows me as a fighter. Everybody knows this guy never stopped fighting. This guy [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4104.400000000001s)]
*  was in the police department and he was criticized in the police department while he was in the police [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4109.76s)]
*  department. Everybody knows that I'm a fighter. And my attorney has put me in a place you can't [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4114.56s)]
*  talk about the case, Eric, because it's still going on. Right. Still pending. And it has been [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4122.4800000000005s)]
*  hard as hell not to talk about the case, because to watch my name be- [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4128.8s)]
*  Be slandered like that. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4135.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, slandered. You have people writing all sorts of, he did a quipro crawl, he's a criminal, [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4136.24s)]
*  he's corrupt, and you have to sit back. And I'm like, my attorney said, Eric, [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4145.04s)]
*  you call me every morning. Don't even think about it. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4152.16s)]
*  So here's the question. If you're saying that this, or Cash is saying that these people exist [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4155.76s)]
*  in government, there's a permanent government, as you will. And by the way, I kind of understand [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4160.8s)]
*  that. The idea that the most powerful country in the history of the world could just change [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4164.56s)]
*  leadership completely every four or eight years is kind of insane. There needs to be something [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4168.8s)]
*  quote unquote permanent. So I get maybe how it starts. I get the idea behind it. But if the people [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4173.6s)]
*  are some nefarious characters, they could go left very quickly. Anyway, so this thing exists, [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4182.160000000001s)]
*  right? Kind of permanently. Now Trump is in power, there'll be another person in power. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4188.8s)]
*  Are they able to influence that group? Or does that group just lay dormant while [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4195.76s)]
*  he's in power and wait for another administration? How does that work when the- [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4202.4800000000005s)]
*  That's a great question. Great question. First of all, I think it was Jack Nicholson and I think a [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4206.08s)]
*  few good men, we said, you really don't want to know the truth. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4211.92s)]
*  You can't handle the truth. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4214.4800000000005s)]
*  You can't handle the truth. Right, right, right. Running a country this complex comes with things [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4215.5199999999995s)]
*  that many of us don't want to know about. We need to be honest with ourselves. Some of these [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4221.44s)]
*  operations, some of these secret operations that take place across countries. I mean, [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4225.679999999999s)]
*  just the complexities of ensuring and keeping us safe. And so when I came into office as the mayor, [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4231.759999999999s)]
*  there were folks who were in agencies because agencies run cities, the Department of Traffic, [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4240.320000000001s)]
*  Department of Sanitation, Police Department. That's what runs cities. There were people who [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4248.64s)]

*  Right. And they make decisions that you don't even realize are being made. And so a mayor comes in [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4256.320000000001s)]
*  with his agenda. There's some things he can do, but there's others. If you're there for 30 years, [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4263.280000000001s)]
*  you're looking at them saying, that's this motherfucker. Why are you telling me? [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4268.8s)]
*  And then you ultimately deal with the failures of those unelected officials. Right. Now, [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4275.52s)]
*  if those unelected officials do something good, you do get the benefit. So it's a win-win. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4281.4400000000005s)]
*  Most circumstances, I imagine if somebody knows they can't lose their job and they're looking out [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4286.96s)]
*  for their agency, they're trying to increase everybody's overtime. They're trying to make [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4290.88s)]
*  sure everybody gets paid more. And wow. Layers and layers of bureaucracy. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4293.76s)]
*  And they just keep on growing and growing and growing. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4299.6s)]
*  They know the people. Because remember, we have a $114 billion budget. You know the amount of money [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4301.68s)]
*  that is on the federal level? So when they went in and looked at USAID and said, wait a minute, [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4312.72s)]
*  you're sending $3 billion to this? You're sending $3, $4 billion to this? And so those permanent [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4318.5599999999995s)]
*  people. And I know we want to believe in particularly the prosecutorial arm of our [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4324.08s)]
*  government. Because the worst thing we want to believe is that people are using the [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4331.36s)]
*  prosecutorial powers to go after people. That is frightening. And we have seen that. Like I said, [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4335.28s)]
*  imagine you are a mother. That's fascism, right? I mean, [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4341.2s)]
*  definitionally. Like if you're going after your political opponents and you're using the power of [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4345.36s)]
*  the government. Imagine you're a mother in some small town somewhere and you truly believe in some [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4348.96s)]
*  of the governmental policies you disagree with. And you want to rally around that free speech. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4355.12s)]
*  You want to organize around that. You should be on the FBI watch list. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4360.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you should have the ability to speak out, which I guess goes more towards what Alex and [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4365.2s)]
*  Akash were just saying before. Like we don't want to remove people's ability to speak out. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4369.839999999999s)]
*  That's who we are. That's who we are as a country. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4374.240000000001s)]
*  Okay. I'm curious. We get frustrated because like we look around and we see stuff not happening. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4376.64s)]
*  And you just pointed out here is one reason why things can't happen sometimes as people [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4381.04s)]
*  in place for long periods of time. And it prevents you from doing something. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4385.6s)]
*  Why don't you air them out? Why don't politicians air them out? [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4389.280000000001s)]
*  No, and you do. And you're able to remove those who are not have workers protection. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4392.72s)]
*  And then you got a lot of laws to protect people. You can't just fire just to be fired. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4401.5199999999995s)]
*  They're not fired. But let's say, hey, I want to build this park right here. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4405.2s)]
*  It's going to help the community. But this guy who's been in this job for 30 years wants this [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4408.639999999999s)]
*  type of kickback in order to get the permit. Why don't we put a name and face to these [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4413.759999999999s)]
*  bureaucratic kingpins? Because we look at it as like, oh, nothing's getting done. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4421.04s)]
*  Oh, Eric Adams isn't doing anything. Because ultimately you can bear the consequences. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4426.4s)]
*  No, without a doubt. And we have been in spite of the layers of bureaucracy. And I want to be [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4430.0s)]
*  very clear. We have 320,000, I think the last time I checked, employees. And the overwhelming [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4436.88s)]
*  number of them get up every day and get their job done. They're committed, they're dedicated. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4444.08s)]
*  I've been able to give them a great contract. They were not getting contracts that they deserve. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4448.0s)]
*  Give them good contract. They're hardworking people. But all you need are a few people in [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4451.68s)]
*  strategic places that can slow up the process. You have to identify them. You have to remove them [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4457.6s)]
*  when you can. You have to replace them with good people that you want. But the big thing that I [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4463.360000000001s)]
*  want you to understand that mayors come and go, presidents come and go, governors come and go. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4468.240000000001s)]
*  Permanent government is real. And whoever's trying to act like it's not real, they're lying. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4474.320000000001s)]
*  So just on that, dealing with the bureaucracy. And I think it's important that you said that, [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4479.68s)]
*  there are 300,000 government employees that make this city operate. It doesn't operate without them. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4484.16s)]
*  We need them. And they don't get caught up in the madness. You call 911, that ambulance, [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4489.5199999999995s)]
*  that cop is coming. That person on the other line, they're doing their job every day. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4494.48s)]
*  And this is an unbelievable task to run this city every single day. So I have an unbelievable [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4499.44s)]
*  amount of respect for them. And when I bring up Doge, I don't want this to become politicized. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4508.32s)]
*  Because I understand how people feel about Elon. And I understand how they feel about- [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4512.64s)]
*  I'm glad you raised that. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4516.8s)]
*  I understand how people feel about swaths of people getting fired and losing their ability [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4517.360000000001s)]
*  to provide for their families. If that is exactly what's happening, I have empathy for those people [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4522.0s)]
*  as well. I think as a normal human being. But is there a, let's say, more delicate way to go into [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4526.160000000001s)]
*  some of the permanent government and make it more efficient, which would help everyday New Yorkers? [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4533.92s)]
*  Does that mean that there's more money for other programs? [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4540.64s)]
*  Those people need to get hired for those other programs as well. It's not like [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4545.12s)]
*  we're just going to cut jobs forever. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4548.72s)]
*  Should we look into permanent government in every municipality and see if there's some blow? [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4552.56s)]
*  How do you even say that without people going, oh, they're trying to doge? [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4559.76s)]
*  You've got to ignore the noise, brother. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4562.240000000001s)]
*  You've got to- my claim to fame is that I know I love this city and I love the people in this city. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4563.679999999999s)]
*  And I don't care what you call me. I don't care how much you yell at me. I don't care how you [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4574.799999999999s)]
*  call names. You're not going to tell me that people should be sleeping on the streets. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4578.96s)]
*  And you can call me whatever you want. I'm not going to let them sleep on the street. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4585.28s)]
*  You're not going to tell me that we should have guns in our community. We took 20,800 guns off [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4589.6s)]
*  our streets, almost 1,500 just this year long. And we're seeing the results of that. And so [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4596.400000000001s)]
*  you have to go into government not saying, okay, let me just say the right things. You have to go [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4603.200000000001s)]
*  in being your honest, authentic self. And that's what we do every day. We're not going to solve [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4610.400000000001s)]
*  all the problems. But you can't tell me we continue to spend this much money and then have [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4615.04s)]
*  40% of our children reading and writing at grade level. All over the country. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4619.84s)]
*  That's the thing. There just has to be a better way. That's why I hate that the doge thing has [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4625.28s)]
*  become so politicized because I think most Americans agree we don't want there to be waste. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4628.88s)]
*  They do agree. They do agree. And the thing is, I keep saying this and people don't like it. They [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4632.88s)]
*  get upset. The Trump derangement syndrome is real. You can hate someone so much that even if they do [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4638.64s)]
*  something right. You're blind to it. Right. You know that? And you can like or dislike Elon, [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4649.84s)]
*  but you don't have any right blowing up someone's Tesla. Right. Exactly. You don't have any right. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4656.320000000001s)]
*  Breaking the law. Who do you think you are? You don't have any right going in and destroying. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4661.280000000001s)]
*  They drew a dick on his Tesla. Yeah. I'm sorry about that. But [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4667.76s)]
*  a white dick too. Small white dick. But think about that. Now, to be fair, they should get 40 years. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4672.639999999999s)]
*  But yeah, so that does happen. That's the hypocrisy. When you say, okay, I'm upset that [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4682.08s)]
*  you are doing doge and you're closing down jobs. But you know what? You should close down Tesla. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4688.5599999999995s)]
*  What about those people that work there? Dude, I literally said that I was on this guy's podcast [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4695.44s)]
*  and I was like, listen, I totally understand you. Theo Vaughn's podcast. And I was like, [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4699.5199999999995s)]
*  I totally understand that people who are critical of Elon, there's reasons to be critical. Everybody [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4704.24s)]
*  should have the freedom to be critical. Right. Right. And I go, but hoping that Tesla shuts down. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4708.719999999999s)]
*  Right. Like I understand you're upset that people lost jobs. It doesn't improve the situation if you [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4716.639999999999s)]
*  make more people lose jobs. Right. He's the richest guy in the world. He's going to be okay. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4722.88s)]
*  He's not the one who, the people that work there. So you're upset these people lost jobs. You're [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4730.0s)]
*  like, I know the solution. More people lose jobs. Think about it. It's the irrational thought [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4734.08s)]
*  process that people are lining up. I just want to hurt each other. I want you to feel pain. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4741.2s)]

*  dick game up. Let's get back to the show. I'm curious, what is your relationship like with [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4879.84s)]
*  Trump now? Do you guys correspond on a frequent basis? When he first got elected, called, hey, [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4883.44s)]
*  president, congratulations. New York is important to you. It's important to me. We got some issues [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4888.0s)]
*  that I need help with, like SALT. These are some of the taxes, I mean, some of the things that were [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4892.799999999999s)]
*  passed. SALT? It's just called a SALT tax. It was hard on New York City. And we have Communicate. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4897.36s)]
*  I said, I was very transparent. I want to work with the president, not war with the president. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4905.759999999999s)]
*  You don't win warring. And there are things I disagree. I'm going to communicate and say, [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4911.44s)]
*  listen, we disagreed. They took $80 million, $60 million away from us from FEMA funding for the [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4915.5199999999995s)]
*  migrants. We disagreed on that. But the goal is how do we sit down, like I did with Biden? People [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4922.96s)]
*  forget that point that I sat down and worked with the president. He came to the city around public [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4929.92s)]
*  safety issues. The president came in. We sat down. We met with the police commissioner. He did what [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4935.679999999999s)]
*  I asked of him to get a director to ATF. It was amazing. So I want to work with our national [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4941.04s)]
*  leaders. I'm the mayor of the biggest city in the country, in the most important country on the [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4946.88s)]
*  globe. Talk that shit. How do we not work with the president? I mean, it's ridiculous. How is [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4951.44s)]
*  it like going down to Mar-a-Lago? Are you guys playing golf and kicking it or are you having [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4956.96s)]
*  serious conversation? No, no, no. Everybody say Mar-a-Lago. It wasn't Mar-a-Lago. I think it was [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4960.88s)]
*  Palm Beach's other golf course. And we were having real conversations about the city. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4966.24s)]
*  We were having conversations about what are the needs of the city. We had some real infrastructure [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4971.84s)]
*  problems that we have to face. We're dealing with our BQE that's almost about to, we don't get it [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4977.04s)]
*  fixed. It can be a real safety issue. So they're real. We had a lot of grants that we were getting [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4982.32s)]
*  for our infrastructure stuff. And so I was really saying, I want to revitalize the economy. I want [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4987.5199999999995s)]
*  to put a chip plant up in the Bronx where we can make the chips and not be held hostage by Taiwan [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4992.16s)]
*  and others. And I said, we can build the whole. That's awesome. Yeah, we can build a whole and [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=4998.5599999999995s)]
*  build our jobs, teach people the technology. So I was sharing with him, it was a, hey, I'm the mayor. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5002.639999999999s)]
*  I want to let you know I'm the mayor of the city you live in. And we want to make sure that this [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5009.599999999999s)]
*  city continues to grow. Now, they critique me speaking with them. The governor went several [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5014.32s)]
*  times to see you. Other governors are saying- White woman privilege. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5018.72s)]
*  But to that point, I think a lot of times we focus on- That's some crazy shit. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5026.56s)]
*  It is, isn't it? Don't go bird watching yourself in a park down there. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5030.8s)]
*  That's true. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5036.64s)]
*  So there's this thing that I think a lot of times happens where it's like, and I'm glad you just said [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5045.76s)]
*  that last part, because a lot of times it happens with cities, especially major cities like New York [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5049.280000000001s)]
*  City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, where the focus so often is about plugging leaks in the boat that [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5053.84s)]
*  we don't think about how to make the boat even bigger. And Americans, we love bigger. We love [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5062.0s)]
*  abundance, especially New Yorkers. All of our families came here for more. So we don't just [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5067.76s)]
*  want the boat plugged. When you say I want to build a chip plant in the Bronx, I'm like, yeah, [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5072.16s)]
*  that's what I want too. And I think an important thing for all New Yorkers, because you could [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5076.88s)]
*  affect New York City, is one, financial literacy. I was talking to the guys on the All In podcast, [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5081.84s)]
*  but specifically, how do we include people like me, who grew up with no financial knowledge [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5088.32s)]
*  whatsoever, how do we include them in the most powerful driving force in New York City, which is [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5093.5199999999995s)]
*  the stock market? How do we get young kids like me, went to public school like Al, went to public [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5098.799999999999s)]
*  school, how do we get financial literacy at a point, and maybe even an injection of capital? [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5104.0s)]
*  Is there a fund? It could be 500 bucks, a thousand bucks for every kid born in New York City that's [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5110.4s)]
*  invested in the S&P 500, so that they start feeling like part of the success of this engine [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5114.64s)]
*  that runs New York City. And America. Well, also in America, but I want to set the president in my [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5121.280000000001s)]
*  city first, and then the rest of America go, oh, I'd like to do that. Oh, for sure. I love that. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5127.280000000001s)]
*  Firstly, right, we're the economic engine of the state and the country. And so what we're doing, [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5132.8s)]
*  my commissioner of DCWP, Deputy Commissioner of Workers Protection, we're now connecting and [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5138.72s)]
*  partnering with banks in every school. We're teaching our young people how to open up bank [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5148.72s)]
*  accounts, how to open up checking accounts, savings accounts. We're going to dive into [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5154.4800000000005s)]
*  the stock exchange, financial literacy, because the greatest impact on your life [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5159.2s)]
*  is your personality and your finances. You could be academically smart, but if you're not [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5164.8s)]
*  emotionally intelligent, you're going nowhere. And if you don't know how to manage your finance, [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5172.64s)]
*  and by the time you get out of school, you're in debt, credit card debt, you're wearing all of your [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5177.6s)]
*  wealth on your pocketbook or your shoes or your clothing. And so we're going to teach our children [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5184.0s)]
*  how to manage money. What we're doing in our educational system, we've put so much attention [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5190.0s)]
*  on your ABCs. We did not put enough attention on developing the full person of our children. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5194.96s)]
*  We're teaching them meditation, breathing exercises, yoga. We're teaching them financial [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5202.96s)]
*  literacy. We're changing the food in our schools to show them how to have healthy food. So we're [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5207.68s)]
*  giving them those foundational issues so no matter where they go, they could prosper. You guys are [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5212.56s)]
*  successful because of your ability to connect with people. If you don't know how to connect [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5219.36s)]
*  with people, you don't know how to communicate with people. Huge advantage. It is. And if you [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5223.5199999999995s)]
*  don't know how to manage your money, you could. How many athletes, ballplayers, etc., makes a ton [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5227.92s)]
*  of money? And then a couple of years after they're out of the game, they don't have, nobody told them [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5233.12s)]
*  how to manage their money. And when you don't have, my parents had money, then lost money. And when I [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5238.4s)]
*  didn't have money, all I thought about was buying X, Y, and Z when I got money. People who have money [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5243.04s)]
*  and grow up comfortable, they don't need these things. They're not thinking about what they don't [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5248.72s)]
*  have all the time. But when you get it, you don't have it, you're buying everything. I just want [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5251.52s)]
*  New Yorkers to feel like a part of the success of the city. When I was young, it was easy because [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5256.320000000001s)]
*  we had sports teams that were successful. So when the Yankees won, I won. But if the stock market [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5261.68s)]
*  is soaring, I want to feel like now maybe because at 35, I fucking finally bought a stock. I'm 41 [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5268.240000000001s)]
*  now. But I want everybody when they see the stock market soaring and they see these businesses, [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5275.04s)]
*  they're like many of them centered in New York City, these CEOs walking around New York City, [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5280.08s)]
*  I want those people that are running those companies, hopefully they're doing a good job [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5284.64s)]
*  and they care about people. I want them to look up to them and be like, wow, part of my financial [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5288.32s)]
*  success in the future is due to that person. And I want them to have some admiration instead of [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5294.16s)]
*  looking at them going, they're getting rich and they're leaving me behind. We can't leave people [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5301.12s)]
*  behind, especially in New York City. If every other city wants to do that shit, that's fine. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5305.44s)]
*  But we should be a beacon of hope for the rest of the country. This is how you take care of your [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5308.8s)]
*  citizens. And I want to get back to that point where it's like, we had a cockiness, bro, [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5313.68s)]
*  that is deserved. This is the greatest city in history. We still got it. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5319.84s)]
*  Nah, we still got it. But some states feel like they could even have a conversation, [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5323.6s)]
*  they could be critical of New York. I'm like, what is wrong with these people? [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5331.120000000001s)]
*  That's what I'm feeling what you're saying. And when I became mayor and said that we have swagger, [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5339.04s)]
*  we're in New York. And we were so used to not feeling the greatness of being in New York, [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5349.36s)]
*  no matter where I go, man, people argue about who's number two, who's number three. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5357.679999999999s)]
*  We stopped feeling as though we're number one. I think COVID hit the city in a big way. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5365.2s)]
*  And I think that we're coming out of it and we're recovering. And I think it's a monumental task [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5371.44s)]
*  that you have. But I think it's really important as we plug those holes in the ship, [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5375.6s)]
*  how big can this fucking ship get? Right. And we can't leave anyone behind. So that's why [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5380.8s)]
*  we're going to start teaching our children blockchain. We're going to start teaching them [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5384.400000000001s)]
*  cryptocurrency. We're going to start teaching them AI on a ground level. These are all new industries. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5388.08s)]
*  And if we start nurturing our babies while they're in second, third grade, they're going to grow up [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5393.68s)]
*  in these industries. We want to teach them game making and not only playing the game, but how to [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5398.8s)]
*  become an entrepreneur. Writing code and shit. Right, the right code. So that's the goal is many [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5403.28s)]
*  people thought they weren't deserving. We kept our young people in parts of the city in survival [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5408.719999999999s)]
*  mode. You know, man's low hierarchy of need, food, shelter, clothing. Don't worry about self-actualization. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5413.92s)]
*  We're just going to keep you down here. Just be happy that you know, survival mode. No, you've [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5419.44s)]
*  got to take people out of survival mode and take them, you want to get to the point of that [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5424.24s)]
*  self-actualization. How long do you have to live here to be considered a New Yorker? [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5428.96s)]
*  I don't think being a New Yorker is based on time. I think it's based on attitude. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5435.36s)]
*  It's not yours. So what makes someone a New Yorker? [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5442.4s)]
*  Yeah, first of all, when you feel comfortable throughout the entire city, no matter where you [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5449.2s)]
*  are, you know, you will have folks who will move into a community and then all of a sudden [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5457.12s)]
*  complain about, what's that loud noise coming from that building? It's the church. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5466.08s)]
*  If they do that, you know. So if you come in with your own attitude, instead of saying I want to [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5472.5599999999995s)]
*  incorporate into the city, I want to bring something to the city, because the diversity [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5481.36s)]
*  of this city is amazing. That's one of the joys of being, not only when I was the board president, [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5486.08s)]
*  but being the mayor. I mean, you can go and sit in a sukkah during the Jewish holiday, Diwali, [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5490.8s)]
*  and one day you can go into Ramadan celebration. You could go to an Easter celebration. You could [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5497.68s)]
*  just be all these parades. I love all these parades. And it's real diversity. It's not like [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5505.04s)]
*  in California where there's a lot of diversity, but everybody lives in their own enclave. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5509.36s)]
*  You've got to pass through somebody's neighborhood, whether you like it or not. Little [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5513.92s)]
*  Italy and Chinatown bleed into one another, so we've got to be around each other, and it's a [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5518.160000000001s)]
*  very unique experience. It is. And I think it's a tragedy that people don't appreciate and enjoy [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5522.72s)]
*  the power of diversity. Our educational process is not only the sterilized environment of a [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5529.76s)]
*  classroom, but it is in the community streets. If you take your children around and have them [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5535.200000000001s)]
*  be part of their education, is learning from different communities, your children will grow [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5541.92s)]
*  up and adapt. Because boardrooms now can no longer, everybody can't look like each other, [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5546.8s)]
*  talk like each other, eat the same food. Such a huge advantage. Yeah. Oh, the diversity is crucial. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5552.0s)]
*  How would the dismantling of the DOE affect New York City? It's a good question. We don't know. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5557.12s)]
*  That's a great question. We don't know the answer yet, but I would challenge you and your listeners [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5563.12s)]
*  to go across the country and look at the reading and writing and math results of all of these [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5568.56s)]
*  cities. Man, you got places where people are like 30% reaching academic standard. Something is wrong. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5575.52s)]
*  So there's a perfect example where it's just like, all right, remember when Rikers, remember the [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5583.76s)]
*  horrible situation that happened, Rikers and people like, we got to shut down Rikers. I don't even [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5590.88s)]
*  know what your position was on that. But I'm like, Rikers isn't the issue. Rikers is a building made [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5594.0s)]
*  out of concrete with bars, right? It's like how that is maybe run is an issue that you could change. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5599.12s)]
*  Love that question, man. Love your question. But maybe that's the thing with part of our education. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5603.84s)]
*  It's like if we're looking at the numbers and they aren't to where they need to be. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5606.48s)]
*  You got to do something. Something has to, maybe it's not take away the whole thing. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5609.92s)]
*  But if you don't believe in some change, then you're just politicizing an issue that's going [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5613.52s)]
*  to end up hurting kids in their education. And especially when you are spending such a high [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5619.44s)]
*  number per student. Right. When do you get a return on your investment? So let's switch to [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5625.919999999999s)]
*  Rikers for a moment. I got rebaptized on Rikers with the inmates. Oh really? Yeah, I went up with [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5631.36s)]
*  the inmates last year. So can you explain Rikers to the people not from New York that are watching? [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5636.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Rikers Island is the New York City's jail. It's where men go to find their sexuality. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5640.799999999999s)]
*  You know what? [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5650.08s)]
*  This is a bad guy. This is a bad guy. I'm telling you. Dangerous man. You can't hang out with a guy. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5650.719999999999s)]
*  I'm telling you. I'm telling you. I'm telling you. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5656.879999999999s)]
*  I just need a post headline tomorrow. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5660.799999999999s)]
*  Merritt Adams baptized. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5664.5599999999995s)]
*  Rikers is our- [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5668.879999999999s)]
*  This is a perfect example of fantasy colliding with reality. And that's what a lot of people [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5670.32s)]
*  would like this job. Idealism collides with realism. So last administration, they made the [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5680.32s)]
*  decision. Rikers is our jail system. They made a decision that they need to close Rikers. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5688.0s)]
*  And we had a little over 3,000 people that were there. They want to close Rikers down and build [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5694.24s)]
*  four more jails, one in each borough except for Staten Island. 51% of Rikers population, [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5700.48s)]
*  they have a mental health issue. 20% have severe mental health. What I'm saying to them, [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5708.32s)]
*  that the four more jails that they want to build, it was going to cost us $8 billion. Now it doubled. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5714.799999999999s)]
*  $16 billion to build it. What I'm saying to them, instead of building four more jails [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5721.04s)]
*  that can't hold the prison population, because the four more jails are going to hold about [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5728.16s)]
*  3,600 people. We have about 7,000 people there right now. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5732.24s)]
*  So you're building four more jails. All right, keep going. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5736.32s)]
*  Right. So what I say to them, instead of building four more jails that can't hold the prison [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5738.719999999999s)]
*  population, why don't we take one of those jails and build a state of the art psychiatric facility [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5743.759999999999s)]
*  so we don't criminalize people who are dealing with psychiatric disorder. We give them the [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5750.0s)]
*  support that they need and take care of them. But people are caught on the romanticism of [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5754.32s)]
*  we close Rikers. Because they think that it will do something. It's like it's not solving your [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5760.639999999999s)]
*  problem. You got 7,100 people. So I ask them, what are you going to do with the other 7,100? [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5764.72s)]
*  Why you can't just let them go? You know what you got to do to go to Rikers now? [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5770.0s)]
*  So you become mayor, right? Yes. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5776.080000000001s)]
*  Do you know what happened with Epstein? Can you figure out what happened? Because [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5783.04s)]
*  it happened in the tombs, right? No, no, no, no. It happened. He was in [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5786.72s)]
*  federal prison. What's the tombs? The tombs are downtown in lower Manhattan. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5790.56s)]
*  But that's just like a weekend or like a weekday jail cell. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5798.320000000001s)]
*  It's a jail also. Any jail is bad. Nobody wants to put people in jail. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5801.84s)]
*  Fair, fair. But he was at federal so you wouldn't have any jurisdiction. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5804.8s)]
*  Now the president is talking about releasing the Epstein information. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5806.88s)]
*  They ain't never going to release that. We're never going to know about JFK. They just keep [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5815.360000000001s)]
*  on saying that shit. Okay, but is there ever a part of you that like when you become mayor to go, [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5818.72s)]
*  yo, tell me who did it or tell me what happened? Can you ask those questions? [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5822.72s)]
*  You always try to seek information. But if they release, as Obama said, if you say it, [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5828.400000000001s)]
*  they got to kill you. Oh wait, so do you know? [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5835.76s)]
*  No, no, no. I have no idea. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5839.52s)]
*  The cameras malfunctioned, the guards fell asleep. There's nothing else you need to know. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5841.12s)]
*  Nobody said we got to get rid of that jail. That is just Wikers. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5851.5199999999995s)]
*  And then what's the guy from the crypto guy? What's his name? [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5857.92s)]
*  Sam Bankman. Sam Bankman. He's also in federal. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5860.88s)]
*  Yeah. So this is just a federal holding house that you don't have any jurisdiction over. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5864.32s)]
*  The federal is a different system. You have federal jurisdictions and you have state, [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5869.04s)]
*  you have city. If you're in Rikers, you're either waiting for trials. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5875.76s)]
*  Or you're going upstate. Right, exactly. So it's a different system. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5881.12s)]
*  Where is Luigi Mangione being held? Is he federal? [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5884.0s)]
*  Federal picked that up also. He's also being federal. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5886.48s)]
*  Sorry, did I hear, I think Joey was telling me, right before, [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5888.88s)]
*  they said they're seeking the death penalty for Luigi? [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5892.64s)]
*  That's what the federal government is doing. We don't make that call. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5894.8s)]
*  Federal government, you know, to intentionally assassinate someone with this. I don't even [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5898.639999999999s)]
*  remember any time in my law enforcement history back then of someone using a silencer, [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5903.2s)]
*  intentionally sort out the CEO and assassinated him. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5909.04s)]
*  So back when you were in law enforcement, did you ever have any run-ins with the supreme team? [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5914.799999999999s)]
*  Did you ever have, or like G-Unit? You ever see the video, supreme team video? [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5920.88s)]
*  Which one? With you? [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5925.2s)]
*  There's a video, yeah. No? [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5926.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm in the video. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5927.28s)]
*  Joey? No, no, no. Because you hear about these iconic gangs like this in New York. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5928.5599999999995s)]
*  I grew up, I grew up, I grew up. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5934.0s)]
*  I know you're from around there. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5934.48s)]
*  Yeah, those guys were larger than life, man. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5936.08s)]
*  So what was it, can you explain, obviously without putting yourself in any kind of position, [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5938.4s)]
*  but can you explain, we hear them in almost folklore. We hear them through rap stories. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5942.96s)]
*  Folklore was real, man. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5948.32s)]
*  So in law. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5949.68s)]
*  It was in- [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5950.32s)]
*  Was it like complete control of the neighborhood? [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5951.5199999999995s)]
*  Cocaine and crack just came online back then. Kelo, Tinka, those whole teams, these guys used to [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5954.88s)]
*  drive around with Roll Royces in NYCHA and they just had a real lock on the drug scene in the city. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5965.28s)]
*  Then rap started to come around. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5974.8s)]
*  So they're telling the stories of it. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5976.48s)]
*  Right, right, right, right. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5977.76s)]
*  And then when you were in law enforcement, was there like, was law enforcement scared of them? [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5979.36s)]
*  Did they pose a threat to laws for it? Did they try to work with law enforcement? [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5984.639999999999s)]
*  Like how did law enforcement even go about handling a violence? [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5987.5199999999995s)]
*  And you know what was interesting, the level of violence was not the same as you saw during the [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5992.639999999999s)]
*  80s, going through the 80s and the 90s. Back then, those guys were about making their money. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=5999.28s)]
*  They would have a beef. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6005.92s)]
*  And then the inner gang, once that started happening. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6006.96s)]
*  Yeah, right. 80s is when you really saw the violence, because there was just so much money. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6009.68s)]
*  It was a lot of money on the street. People wanted to take over [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6014.56s)]
*  areas, take over streets. But back during, you know, when you look around, 75, coming to the 80s, [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6018.56s)]
*  you know, crack started to really start to make his way. And really crack really escalated to [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6026.72s)]
*  violence, you know, when you start dealing with crack cocaine. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6033.12s)]
*  Because of profitability or before? [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6036.08s)]
*  Profit. For whatever reason, you know, even heroin wasn't, you know, it didn't bring that [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6037.6s)]
*  level of violence going into the 60s. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6044.48s)]
*  I would say that the cost per kilo also, you can get a lot of money, like 20 grand for a key. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6046.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6051.04s)]
*  Oh, God. So it's just so profitable. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6051.44s)]
*  It's odorless, it can transport easily. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6053.28s)]
*  And then you had, you know, you had those who were participating in law enforcement [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6055.12s)]
*  that was part of making that money. Also, there was some illegal stuff that was going on. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6058.88s)]
*  So they were corrupting police officers? [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6063.04s)]
*  77 mock boys. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6065.04s)]
*  This is the Brooklyn one, right? [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6066.88s)]
*  Yes, yes. 77% [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6068.48s)]
*  Left out. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6069.84s)]
*  Yeah, you're the dirty 30. Because guys were seeing so much money being made on the street, [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6070.64s)]
*  you know. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6075.6s)]
*  There is something I've thought about, which is like, you cannot, when you bestow [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6076.16s)]
*  responsibility on somebody, you cannot underpay them to a point where they're corruptible. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6082.8s)]
*  Well said. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6088.96s)]
*  Now, I'm not saying you have to pay every single politician or every single police officer a [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6089.6s)]
*  million dollars or whatever it is. But they can't be living like below the poverty line or at it, [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6093.28s)]
*  because it would be too enticing. They have so much power. It would be too enticing not to do that. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6099.36s)]
*  And you know, you do these jobs because you believe in the job. But at the same time, [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6103.92s)]
*  you know, you should always compensate people to take care of their family. And even when the [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6109.2s)]
*  modeling commission and others did their review over some of the action, they said it's important [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6114.4s)]
*  to pay law enforcement officers. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6119.04s)]
*  I would think the highest paid profession should be cops, teachers, doctors. These are positions [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6121.2s)]
*  you want the best people going to. And if I'm a cop making great money, the idea that I might [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6125.04s)]
*  mess around and do some corrupt stuff or treat somebody badly and it might cost me this job, [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6131.12s)]
*  it pays me well. I don't think it's worth it. We get a lot of them out. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6134.64s)]
*  And even teachers, you know, you go someplace like Korea, teachers are held to an extreme high level [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6138.32s)]
*  of respect. Here, you know, we gave our teachers great contracts, we gave our cops great contracts, [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6143.84s)]
*  but you're right. You should make sure that they're receiving the suitable pay that they [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6150.24s)]
*  deserve. That's what it comes down to. Can you still give out keys to the city? [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6155.599999999999s)]
*  Yes. We didn't give you a key yet. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6162.96s)]
*  That's true. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6166.0s)]
*  That's how we talk. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6168.0s)]
*  I would never ask for something like that. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6170.0s)]
*  I would never ask for something like that. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6174.0s)]
*  I would never ask for something like that. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6176.0s)]
*  I just want a rent controlled apartment. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6178.8s)]
*  Forget the key. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6180.8s)]
*  You want a key to the apartment. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6182.8s)]
*  I want one key. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6184.8s)]
*  Rent controlled apartment. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6186.8s)]
*  But this man deserves a key to the city. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6188.8s)]
*  Nobody rides for New York harder than this guy and this guy. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6190.8s)]
*  Okay, quick couple quick New York questions. Which borough has the most attractive women? [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6194.8s)]
*  I think all of them have great shorties. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6200.8s)]
*  Good political answer. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6205.6s)]
*  Good political answer. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6207.6s)]
*  You know how many times you go viral? I drive my team crazy. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6209.6s)]
*  I bet. She's writing notes right now. He's going crazy right now. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6215.6s)]
*  Don't give him a mic. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6219.6s)]
*  No, we just locked up the mayoral elections. Don't even worry about it. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6221.6s)]
*  But it is Queens though. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6227.6s)]
*  You tripping. Maybe the best strip clubs. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6229.6s)]
*  We need an eleven in New York. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6232.400000000001s)]
*  This is not good. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6238.400000000001s)]
*  Why don't we have an eleven in New York? [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6240.400000000001s)]
*  I spoke to some folks. We may be rolling out a million. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6242.400000000001s)]
*  Think of all the things we gave Miami. We gave them Carbone. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6246.400000000001s)]
*  That's true. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6250.400000000001s)]
*  We gave them so many places. They can't give us one little eleven. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6252.400000000001s)]
*  A nice night club where you don't have to feel like a scumbag in a store. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6256.400000000001s)]
*  But there are strippers there. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6261.2s)]
*  They happen to go for some reason. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6263.2s)]
*  What a great coincidence. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6265.2s)]
*  That's 24 hours. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6267.2s)]
*  That's the key. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6269.2s)]
*  I've never been to eleven. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6271.2s)]
*  Sounds good. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6275.2s)]
*  Sounds good. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6277.2s)]
*  We're going to work on that. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6279.2s)]
*  Why do places have to close at four? [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6281.2s)]
*  We need a 24 hour district. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6284.0s)]
*  And these community boards. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6288.0s)]
*  This guy. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6290.0s)]
*  A 24 hour district with red lights. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6292.0s)]
*  We do not need that. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6294.0s)]
*  New Yorkers go to sleep. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6296.0s)]
*  We need that. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6298.0s)]
*  Because then you have illegal after parties and you don't want that. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6300.0s)]
*  I've never been to those. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6302.0s)]
*  You've never been to eleven. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6304.0s)]
*  I've never been to the after parties. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6306.0s)]
*  I don't know where to go. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6308.0s)]
*  I don't know where to go. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6310.0s)]
*  Out of nowhere. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6312.8s)]
*  Unprompted. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6314.8s)]
*  We need an eleven. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6316.8s)]
*  Just a moment to think about. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6318.8s)]
*  That is it. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6322.8s)]
*  You want to make New York City abundant. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6324.8s)]
*  That's one of the problems we've got to solve. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6326.8s)]
*  That's true. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6328.8s)]
*  It's crazy. It's a disaster we don't have an eleven. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6330.8s)]
*  It is, brother. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6332.8s)]
*  I know that other guy running for mayor wouldn't make an eleven. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6334.8s)]
*  Heck no. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6336.8s)]
*  That old cornball. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6338.8s)]
*  With a nipple piercing. He could dance on the pole with an eleven. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6341.6s)]
*  How are we going to have a nipple piercing and run for mayor of New York City? [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6347.6s)]
*  That's insane. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6351.6s)]
*  Queens maybe. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6353.6s)]
*  Another nipple headline. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6355.6s)]
*  Listen. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6357.6s)]
*  I didn't say who it is so we didn't even know who it is. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6359.6s)]
*  But that other guy. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6361.6s)]
*  I can't believe it. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6363.6s)]
*  Wearing white shirts. Wearing a blouse with a nipple ring. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6365.6s)]
*  Saying he's going to run for mayor. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6367.6s)]
*  This guy's got to be crazy. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6370.400000000001s)]
*  Against Adams? [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6372.400000000001s)]
*  You really want to make New York great legalized sex work. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6374.400000000001s)]
*  Small business. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6376.400000000001s)]
*  Let's not get too crazy. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6378.400000000001s)]
*  I think it's the move. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6380.400000000001s)]
*  Here's one final question. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6382.400000000001s)]
*  Canal Street has now become an open air bazaar. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6384.400000000001s)]
*  When I was growing up, [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6390.400000000001s)]
*  when I was growing up, [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6392.400000000001s)]
*  you could get the fake bags. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6394.400000000001s)]
*  But there was a little, I got my PlayStation hack [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6396.400000000001s)]
*  so I could play the fake video games and shit. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6399.2s)]
*  But you had to go down into one of the underground malls. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6401.2s)]
*  And it was a kind of nice, [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6403.2s)]
*  undercover thing. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6405.2s)]
*  And sometimes I asked the cops that were on the corner, [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6407.2s)]
*  I was like, [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6409.2s)]
*  yo, what do you do about this? [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6411.2s)]
*  And he was like, listen bro, we can lock them up and then they're out in a few days. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6413.2s)]
*  They've kind of, [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6415.2s)]
*  unfortunately, were kind of clipped and aren't doing anything. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6417.2s)]
*  What do we do about a circumstance like that? [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6421.2s)]
*  And deputy mayor Dortrie, Kaz Dortrie, [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6425.2s)]
*  he has done a great job. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6428.0s)]
*  What we've done, we've gone after the mother load. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6430.0s)]
*  And gone after some of the warehouses. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6434.0s)]
*  That are holding or making all the fake bags. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6436.0s)]
*  So if you go and just round up who's on Canal. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6438.0s)]
*  There's going to be another person next to it. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6440.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6442.0s)]
*  So we've hit a couple of locations. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6444.0s)]
*  If you were to go online, you'd see we've taken millions of dollars in supplies. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6446.0s)]
*  We're still doing investigations. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6450.0s)]
*  We want to go after the feeder. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6452.0s)]
*  If not, you're just really, [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6454.0s)]
*  you're not even locking the person up. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6456.8s)]
*  You're confiscating the property. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6458.8s)]
*  This is important information to get out to the people. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6460.8s)]
*  I remember seeing it every single day. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6462.8s)]
*  And I think, [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6464.8s)]
*  I think two things. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6466.8s)]
*  I would think that the average person walking around here [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6468.8s)]
*  feels that the police do not have authority. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6470.8s)]
*  Which I think New Yorkers, [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6472.8s)]
*  we don't want to feel like that. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6474.8s)]
*  We don't like to be told what to do. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6476.8s)]
*  But we still like knowing the police can handle some shit. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6478.8s)]
*  But also it feels like is this city doing anything to stop this? [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6482.8s)]
*  The fact that you're going after the motherlode. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6485.6s)]
*  Yes, that's the goal. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6487.6s)]
*  We've done a number of sweeps. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6489.6s)]
*  And now it's the next step. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6491.6s)]
*  So now we've hit several warehouses. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6493.6s)]
*  And we're now zooing in. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6495.6s)]
*  That's the same thing we did with the illegal cannabis shops. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6497.6s)]
*  We started going after the motherlodes. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6499.6s)]
*  And we closed down [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6501.6s)]
*  I think about 1600 of them. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6503.6s)]
*  And now the illegal cannabis shops [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6505.6s)]
*  are making money now. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6507.6s)]
*  So we want to go after those motherlodes [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6509.6s)]
*  and get it to close down. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6511.6s)]
*  Why not just increase the presence of police on Canal? [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6514.400000000001s)]
*  Just have a bunch of police always stationed on Canal. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6516.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but you know, if you, and we do. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6520.400000000001s)]
*  Because they do that in the hood. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6522.400000000001s)]
*  The precinct is there. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6524.400000000001s)]
*  But you don't want those guys going after one [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6526.400000000001s)]
*  one after the other during the confiscation [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6528.400000000001s)]
*  when you have some heavy crime that's taking place. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6530.400000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6532.400000000001s)]
*  If there was a cop right there in the corner, they're not even going to set up. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6534.400000000001s)]
*  But now they do. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6536.400000000001s)]
*  They're there. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6538.400000000001s)]
*  They know if you confiscate [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6540.400000000001s)]
*  the merchandise, they're going to go right back [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6543.2s)]
*  and get a new shipment of it [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6545.2s)]
*  and just be back out there again. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6547.2s)]
*  But there maybe is a point to that. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6549.2s)]
*  Like if you confiscate every single day for six months [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6551.2s)]
*  eventually they just start going. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6553.2s)]
*  Think about the manpower that's takes man. That's some serious manpower. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6555.2s)]
*  There's another thing. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6557.2s)]
*  And also you, two guys go confiscate one person [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6559.2s)]
*  then everybody else on the block is like, alright we're good. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6561.2s)]
*  You would have to have [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6563.2s)]
*  100 cops confiscate [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6565.2s)]
*  the 200 people that are throughout Canal selling things. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6567.2s)]
*  And you can't throw up your hand. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6569.2s)]
*  The complexity of solving the problem is not an answer. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6572.0s)]
*  There's several [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6574.0s)]
*  investigations that are underway [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6576.0s)]
*  now of going after [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6578.0s)]
*  the large shipments. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6580.0s)]
*  What is the best bodega boner pill? [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6582.0s)]
*  If I answer that I'll be on the front page of the show. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6588.0s)]
*  Okay, any other questions [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6594.0s)]
*  before Mayor Adams [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6596.0s)]
*  gets out here? About to be second term Mayor Adams. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6598.0s)]
*  You are definitely running. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6600.8s)]
*  As a Democrat? [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6602.8s)]
*  100% as a Democrat. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6604.8s)]
*  I'm running 100% as a Democrat. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6606.8s)]
*  And listen, [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6608.8s)]
*  it breaks my heart that [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6610.8s)]
*  New Yorkers had to go through these last 15 months. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6612.8s)]
*  And [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6614.8s)]
*  what I wanted to do to New Yorkers [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6616.8s)]
*  is to let them know [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6618.8s)]
*  that no matter what I was going through [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6620.8s)]
*  I was going to [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6622.8s)]
*  stand tall and fight for the city. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6624.8s)]
*  And I also wanted to send a symbol. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6626.8s)]
*  Because everybody is going through something. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6629.6s)]
*  We sit here, we talk and we laugh. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6631.6s)]
*  But I know if you go into the crevices of your mind [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6633.6s)]
*  there's something in your life [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6635.6s)]
*  that you're wrestling with. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6637.6s)]
*  It could be a health issue, it could be a family member, etc. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6639.6s)]
*  And I wanted them to say, [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6641.6s)]
*  listen, look at all that this guy is going through. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6643.6s)]
*  And he's still getting up every day. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6645.6s)]
*  And he's delivering for us. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6647.6s)]
*  He's building the houses, keeping our city safe. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6649.6s)]
*  And I'm hoping that they would draw on it [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6651.6s)]
*  when they're dealing with their experience. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6653.6s)]
*  Saturday, man, it broke my heart [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6655.6s)]
*  when I was in Parkway. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6658.400000000001s)]
*  And the mother and the two children [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6660.400000000001s)]
*  were killed in that accident. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6662.400000000001s)]
*  And I had to sit in that room [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6664.400000000001s)]
*  with the dad and talk with him. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6666.400000000001s)]
*  I do that so often. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6668.400000000001s)]
*  And I got to tell people [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6670.400000000001s)]
*  that hey, [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6672.400000000001s)]
*  you know what, you're going to get through this. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6674.400000000001s)]
*  I can't say that [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6676.400000000001s)]
*  if I'm jumping ship [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6678.400000000001s)]
*  when I'm going through something personally. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6680.400000000001s)]
*  I want to show New Yorkers [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6682.400000000001s)]
*  the grit and grind [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6684.400000000001s)]
*  of those who grew up here. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6686.4s)]
*  We're grit and grind. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6688.4s)]
*  We fight, we never surrender, [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6690.4s)]
*  never give up. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6692.4s)]
*  I'm hoping your listeners [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6694.4s)]
*  will go look at our record, man. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6696.4s)]
*  I think you guys can do... [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6698.4s)]
*  I think that there is a version [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6700.4s)]
*  now with social media [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6702.4s)]
*  of posting the accomplishments. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6704.4s)]
*  And I think that's something [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6706.4s)]
*  that the Trump administration [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6708.4s)]
*  and Trump specifically, [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6710.4s)]
*  because he's so entertainment-minded, [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6712.4s)]
*  any kind of win, [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6714.4s)]
*  even if it's not a win, anything that they're doing, [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6716.4s)]
*  they're letting you know they're doing it. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6718.4s)]
*  I don't know if we're taking Greenland, [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6720.4s)]
*  but sending JD Vance to walk around, [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6722.4s)]
*  it's a lot of marketing. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6724.4s)]
*  And I think there's a version where it's like, [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6726.4s)]
*  you even saying that about Canal Street [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6728.4s)]
*  makes me feel like, oh, at least this is being thought about. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6730.4s)]
*  At least they're trying to do something. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6732.4s)]
*  And I think there's a version where maybe it's through social media [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6734.4s)]
*  or whatever it is, but it's not through you doing a conference every single day. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6736.4s)]
*  There's other things you do with your time. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6738.4s)]
*  But I think disseminating that information [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6740.4s)]
*  to New Yorkers, one, gets us excited [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6742.4s)]
*  about a chip plan in the Bronx, [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6744.4s)]
*  but two, makes us feel seen when we go, [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6746.4s)]
*  hey, the price of this is expensive, [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6748.4s)]
*  and you're like, we're the richest city in the world. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6750.4s)]
*  Maybe we've got to subsidize eggs. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6752.4s)]
*  But no kid in New York City should not be able to [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6754.4s)]
*  afford an egg in their teeth and the like. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6756.4s)]
*  Give us that information that you got [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6758.4s)]
*  what you're working on. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6760.4s)]
*  If I had to say one thing, when we failed that, [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6762.4s)]
*  we failed to get our success out. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6764.4s)]
*  And our biggest failure on that [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6766.4s)]
*  is that what I've learned [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6768.4s)]
*  is that if Colgate had to depend on the tabloids to tell their success, [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6770.4s)]
*  they would never be in business. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6776.4s)]
*  We had to depend on traditional tabloids to tell our success. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6778.4s)]
*  Right, the word of mouth is what is more popular. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6782.4s)]
*  The tabloids are not going to be in your favor. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6784.4s)]
*  Heck no. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6786.4s)]
*  But you don't need them anymore. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6788.4s)]
*  Someone shared with me the other day, that was very interesting, [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6790.4s)]
*  that they are, [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6792.4s)]
*  people forget that they are [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiZDvERO16s&t=6794.4s)]
