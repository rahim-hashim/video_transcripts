*  We're going to take a break real quick because you got to get in shape. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=1761.08s)]
*  And the best ways to do that is with some of these momentous products like creatine. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=1763.56s)]
*  Momentous creatine uses creatine monohydrate, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=1767.48s)]
*  which is the gold standard in creatine supplementation. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=1769.56s)]
*  It is fully NSF certified, meaning it contains no banned substances, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=1772.12s)]
*  no toxic contaminants, no heavy metals, no pesticides. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=1775.8s)]
*  So what you see on the label is exactly what you get. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=1779.08s)]
*  Creatine's benefits for athletic performance include accelerated lean muscle development, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=1781.24s)]
*  increased strength and power, enhanced recovery and rehabilitation. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=1785.3999999999999s)]
*  Mark takes a little time. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=1788.6799999999998s)]
*  Guy looks fantastic. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=1789.48s)]
*  Also, there's whey protein. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=1790.44s)]
*  Mark, you're on whey protein. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=1791.96s)]
*  That's what you need. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=1793.6399999999999s)]
*  It's the best kind of protein. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=1794.44s)]
*  Protein is the most important building block for muscle. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=1795.6399999999999s)]
*  And momentous grass fed whey protein isolate powder is sourced from EU dairy farmers [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=1798.04s)]
*  who adhere to strict regulations in the EU and whose grass fed cows are free from hormones, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=1802.28s)]
*  steroids, synthetic growth hormones. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=1806.76s)]
*  Again, guys, EU cows, way better quality. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=1807.96s)]
*  I'm thinking about moving there. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=1810.28s)]
*  Again, much like every other product at momentous, it is NSF sport certified [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=1811.56s)]

*  game because it's not about athleticism, right? [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2686.0s)]
*  It's about just staying outside long. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2688.0s)]
*  You know what? [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2690.0s)]

*  This is two and a half. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2695.0s)]

*  That's what happens. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2706.0s)]
*  If you took an average baseball team, wouldn't they destroy these guys? [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2707.0s)]
*  Like, if you took the New York Yankees and they played the team India. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2709.0s)]
*  I'd be curious to know what Shub thinks. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2713.0s)]
*  To me, yeah, but I'd be curious to know what Shub or Vala thinks. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2715.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2718.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2724.0s)]
*  It's kind of like a punt swing. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2725.0s)]
*  That's when you swing and you're going for six runs right there. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2726.0s)]
*  So I think that was four or six. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2729.0s)]

*  10.30 a.m. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2787.0s)]
*  Wait, India USA? [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2788.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2789.0s)]

*  Wait, can we play? [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2792.0s)]
*  Like, what is the rule? [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2793.0s)]
*  How does that work? [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2794.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2795.0s)]
*  I'm suing them. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2796.0s)]
*  Like, is it super strict? [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2797.0s)]
*  It's like first come first serve. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2798.0s)]
*  What does it do? [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2799.0s)]
*  It's a sign up seat. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2800.0s)]
*  I can show off the first bowl. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2801.0s)]
*  I got that, dude. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2802.0s)]
*  Oh, do they do that at a ceremony? [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2803.0s)]
*  I'm more than a sketch we did. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2804.0s)]
*  You mean? [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2805.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2806.0s)]
*  Who would win a baseball team or like a regular baseball team at cricket or the cricket team, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2807.0s)]
*  the India cricket team? [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2815.56s)]
*  Like the Yankees? [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2816.56s)]
*  Well, they got to, if they train. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2817.56s)]
*  In my brain, I hate to admit it, but baseball would be, yeah, they train for, I don't know, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2818.56s)]
*  a month. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2822.6s)]
*  And just imagine there's not a mud pit directly outside the ring that's distracting them the [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2823.6s)]
*  entire time. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2827.36s)]
*  Distract all the white pictures. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2828.36s)]
*  I think that's why Pakistan, to be honest with you, I think that's why that they've [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2829.36s)]
*  lost every single game is I think they're just trying to speed it up. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2832.04s)]
*  Right? [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2834.56s)]
*  Because they want to go dick diving in that mud pit. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2835.56s)]
*  Immediately. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2837.56s)]
*  How fast can this fucking thing go? [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2838.56s)]
*  I think those are the cheerleaders. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2839.56s)]
*  That's the cheerleader. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2840.56s)]
*  I think it's the swamp. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2841.56s)]
*  I mean, all of you. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2842.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2843.56s)]
*  Tell us who wins, who wins the Yankees or team India? [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2844.56s)]
*  The baseball team will be better at fielding. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2852.4s)]
*  They're just way better at throwing and catching all that kind of stuff. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2854.88s)]
*  But I don't know how they'll do without the gloves. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2858.12s)]
*  Cricket players will be better batters. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2861.16s)]
*  Than a baseball player? [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2863.44s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2864.44s)]
*  Yes, it's so different. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2865.44s)]
*  What about like a frat? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2866.44s)]
*  Way harder to hit off the bounce. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2867.44s)]
*  Just from the hazing. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2870.32s)]
*  I feel like a frat from the hazing would be able to play this really well. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2871.32s)]
*  No American will be able to stand the Australian hazing. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2874.76s)]
*  Wait, why? [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2877.56s)]
*  There's no chance. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2878.56s)]
*  Those guys are so good at it. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2879.56s)]
*  What do they do? [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2880.92s)]
*  I mean, what's his name? [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2881.92s)]
*  Volk had to drink his own piss or whatever, right? [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2882.92s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2885.1600000000003s)]
*  He meant the battling specifically. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2886.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2887.1600000000003s)]
*  What's going on right now? [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2888.1600000000003s)]
*  We're talking about hazing or we're talking about batting? [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2889.1600000000003s)]
*  I don't know anymore. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2890.1600000000003s)]
*  With American fraternities, what they do is they take a paddle kind of like that and they [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2891.1600000000003s)]
*  spank your ass. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2900.1600000000003s)]
*  So that's why they'd be so good at the batting. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2902.0s)]
*  I'm going to be honest, I think Americans would be worse fielders then because there's [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2903.68s)]
*  no glove, it's pure hands and you're running a lot more. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2907.0s)]
*  What about Blackfield? [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2909.16s)]
*  They've been fielding for 400 fucking... [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2910.16s)]
*  Honestly, that's... [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2911.16s)]
*  You take it too far. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2912.16s)]
*  Honestly, that's... [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2913.16s)]
*  Fuck, fuck, fuck. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2914.16s)]
*  Fuck, fuck, fuck. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2915.16s)]
*  I mean, it's so racial, dude. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2916.16s)]
*  What? [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2917.16s)]
*  But he saw the guy with the one-handed catch. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2918.16s)]
*  He got it! [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2919.16s)]
*  He thought it was cotton. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2920.16s)]
*  Come on, no, see? [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2921.16s)]
*  You can go too far with it. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2922.16s)]
*  Honestly, that's too stationary of a field. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2923.16s)]
*  That's just a simple bend and reach. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2926.16s)]
*  Come on. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2928.16s)]
*  This is running involved. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2929.16s)]
*  You've got to play behind. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2930.16s)]
*  Yeah, Blackfield don't know about running. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2931.16s)]
*  I feel like Blackfield needs to just take over this thing. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2932.16s)]
*  Take over, right? [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2936.16s)]
*  We shouldn't take it. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2937.16s)]
*  There is a team of all Black people. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2938.16s)]
*  It's the West Indies. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2940.16s)]
*  It's all the British, old British colonies in the Caribbean. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2941.16s)]
*  And they have historically been one of the scariest teams to play. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2945.16s)]
*  No, not the Iraqis or whatever. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2948.16s)]
*  It's not me anymore, everybody. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2950.16s)]
*  It's not fucking me. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2953.16s)]
*  Now you see why it's funny. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2955.16s)]
*  Now you see why it's funny. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2957.16s)]
*  This is what happens every time you talk. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2958.16s)]
*  You do it, Bob. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2960.16s)]
*  It's not fucking me. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2961.16s)]
*  It's not funny. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2962.16s)]
*  Try it one more time. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2963.16s)]
*  Okay, there's a Black team. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2964.16s)]
*  Oh, where are they? [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2966.16s)]
*  Historically mostly Black. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2967.16s)]
*  Historically mostly Black. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2968.16s)]
*  And then... [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2969.16s)]
*  What else is about them? [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2970.16s)]
*  I don't think he knows about Parma. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2971.16s)]
*  You said they're the loudest team. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2972.16s)]
*  They're the scariest. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2974.16s)]
*  They're the scariest. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2975.16s)]
*  They're the scariest. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2976.16s)]
*  Okay, for what reason? [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2977.16s)]
*  Why are they so scary? [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2978.16s)]
*  They're very, very good at the game. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2979.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2983.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2984.16s)]
*  Have they ever won at all? [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2985.16s)]
*  Yeah, they won it the first two times they won a role. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2986.16s)]
*  The first two times they ever played? [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2989.16s)]
*  No, the first two World Cups ever. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2990.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2992.16s)]

*  That doesn't count. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=2999.16s)]
*  We haven't won since. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3000.16s)]

*  And the second most famous man in Turkey, Cape Town's Ruth. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3005.16s)]

*  Tell me about that. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3011.16s)]
*  He's Afro-Caribbean, we'll have you. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3012.16s)]
*  Yeah, we got you. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3013.16s)]
*  Since I started watching, it was like, what, 09 or whatever. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3014.16s)]
*  They've never been talked about as potential winners. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3019.16s)]
*  The West Indies have won two T20 World Cups in I think 2015 or something like that. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3021.16s)]
*  Back when we didn't care about it, right? [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3027.16s)]
*  Nobody really cared about it. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3029.16s)]
*  Yeah, we didn't really care about it. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3030.16s)]
*  I know this. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3031.16s)]
*  T20 was a joke back then. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3032.16s)]
*  Now we're making way more money off of it. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3033.16s)]
*  So people care. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3035.16s)]
*  Now people care. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3036.16s)]
*  Now no one really thinks y'all are going to win at all. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3037.16s)]
*  It's a stupid, silly sport. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3039.16s)]
*  We should go tomorrow. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3041.16s)]
*  We should go tomorrow. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3042.16s)]
*  We're going to dominate. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3043.16s)]
*  How long is the game? [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3044.16s)]
*  Three hours. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3045.16s)]
*  Oh, they've condensed it. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3046.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3047.16s)]
*  It used to be, what, three or five days. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3048.16s)]
*  The original version is five days. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3051.16s)]
*  Then they made a one day version, and this is the three hour condensed version for fun. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3053.16s)]
*  Just for fun purposes. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3058.16s)]
*  And money also. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3059.16s)]
*  So if we get there late, does it matter? [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3060.16s)]
*  Can we get there an hour? [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3062.16s)]
*  That's the thing, I might have to get there a little late. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3063.16s)]
*  No, you can get there an hour late. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3064.16s)]
*  You missed the first innings, but the Jeopardy starts in the second innings anyway. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3066.16s)]
*  We're at a child's game. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3069.16s)]
*  We're at ISD, dude. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3071.16s)]
*  So why are you going to get there? [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3072.16s)]
*  I'm going to get there because I'm Indian, yeah. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3073.16s)]
*  Come on, dude. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3075.16s)]
*  Yeah, have a child, Al. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3076.16s)]
*  I hate that. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3080.16s)]
*  You go to that bag, man. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3081.16s)]
*  We have singing class tomorrow. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3083.16s)]
*  Singing? [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3085.16s)]
*  Singing class tomorrow. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3086.16s)]
*  How old is she? [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3087.16s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3088.16s)]
*  She is four months and a week old. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3089.16s)]
*  What is she singing about? [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3091.16s)]
*  White people, bruh. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3092.16s)]
*  She's going to sing. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3093.16s)]
*  That's what she's going to do. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3096.16s)]
*  We took swimming class, we're drowning class the other day, and now we're taking singing [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3098.16s)]
*  class. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3103.16s)]
*  Y'all should do that one. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3104.16s)]
*  And we just sing songs. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3105.16s)]
*  That's what we sing. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3106.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3107.16s)]
*  That's what we do. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3108.16s)]
*  What song? [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3109.16s)]
*  Why is it class? [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3110.16s)]
*  Why can't you just put on a playlist and sing to her? [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3111.16s)]
*  It's ... you have too much money. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3113.16s)]
*  You need to spend it. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3116.16s)]
*  Just keep it real. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3118.16s)]
*  If you don't spend the money, your wife will spend it on herself. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3119.16s)]
*  So what you need to do is get the money out of her hands as quick as you possibly can. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3124.16s)]
*  We should start a singing class and steal from rich people. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3128.16s)]
*  That sounds awesome. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3130.16s)]
*  I didn't realize that. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3131.16s)]
*  I have to ask my wife, what are we singing? [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3132.16s)]
*  Why is this? [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3134.16s)]
*  How did you not think of this? [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3135.16s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3136.16s)]
*  Sign the kid up. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3137.16s)]
*  It could be Beat Buds. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3138.16s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3139.16s)]
*  I'm going to look at this. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3140.16s)]
*  It's Beat Buds, but isn't that a playlist? [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3141.16s)]
*  It's a sing-a-long group. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3142.16s)]
*  Oh, oh, I'm sorry. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3143.16s)]
*  It's not singing. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3144.16s)]
*  It's music class. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3145.16s)]
*  That's harder. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3146.16s)]
*  She's going to be picking up a violin. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3147.16s)]
*  She can't play guitar. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3148.16s)]
*  You know, see, she's going to be picking up a guitar. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3149.16s)]
*  You've never seen these little chinitos playing instruments when they're one year old? [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3150.16s)]
*  These little chinitos are playing instruments. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3155.16s)]
*  Yeah, but maybe if she's vaccinated enough, we can make her one. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3158.16s)]
*  She's getting her vaccine today and then tomorrow we find out she's a savant. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3163.16s)]
*  If she goes in tomorrow and she's ripping the violin, then we got one in the bag. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3168.16s)]
*  You got to do a before and after blocks test. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3173.16s)]
*  Just see how much better she gets at building. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3175.16s)]
*  So fucking sick. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3177.16s)]
*  It's so fucking scary. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3178.16s)]
*  It really is scary. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3179.16s)]
*  Every time she drools after the vaccine, I'm like, all right, there it is. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3183.16s)]
*  There it is. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3186.16s)]
*  Kids drool. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3187.16s)]
*  Well, apparently they teethe and they start drooling, but the last time I didn't know [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3188.16s)]
*  that because I don't read any of the books my wife tells me to read. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3192.16s)]
*  So she got the vaccine and she's just a fucking basset hound slop everywhere. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3194.16s)]
*  And I'm like, they fucking retarded her, dude. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3199.16s)]
*  They fucking vaccinated her brains out and now she's drooling all over the place. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3201.16s)]
*  I really felt that way. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3206.16s)]
*  And then I learned it's just teeth. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3207.16s)]
*  So that's what's up. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3209.16s)]
*  Teeth are coming in. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3210.16s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3211.16s)]
*  Watch out my wife's nips. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3212.16s)]
*  Let's see if you complain. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3213.16s)]
*  When I nibbled on them, you were complaining. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3216.16s)]
*  Let's see if you still complain. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3218.16s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3219.16s)]
*  When I used to chomp on them things. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3221.16s)]
*  It will hurt. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3223.16s)]
*  You know? [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3224.16s)]
*  Yeah, that shit does seem painful. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3225.16s)]
*  What? [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3227.16s)]
*  You ain't never chomping them things? [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3228.16s)]
*  You got to get them ready, bro. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3230.16s)]
*  You got to chew them up and get them ready. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3232.16s)]
*  With all due respect. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3234.16s)]
*  Yeah, you got to beat them up. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3235.16s)]
*  It's like a new speed bag. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3236.16s)]
*  That shit don't hit right. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3237.16s)]
*  With all due respect. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3238.16s)]
*  You know? [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3239.16s)]
*  Listen, Al, with all due respect, if you don't beat up the speed bag, it's not going to hit [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3240.16s)]
*  right. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3244.16s)]
*  So I'm in there, bro. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3245.16s)]
*  All right. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3246.16s)]
*  Do your thing, brother. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3247.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3248.16s)]
*  I'm going to let it just chill. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3249.16s)]
*  It's going to be you one day. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3250.16s)]
*  I'm going to let it chill. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3251.16s)]
*  You're going to see two hard nips and you're going to be like, them's too hard for my daughter. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3252.16s)]
*  I need to break them in. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3255.16s)]
*  I need to break them in. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3260.16s)]
*  It's a new myth. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3261.16s)]
*  My daughter's gums can't handle all that. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3262.16s)]
*  My daughter got brand new gums. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3264.16s)]
*  She can't gum through a hard nip like this. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3265.16s)]
*  So you need to crunch them down for her. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3268.16s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3270.16s)]
*  Baby bird. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3271.16s)]
*  You need to baby bird it. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3272.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3273.16s)]
*  All right. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3274.16s)]

*  Now let's get back to the show. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3395.16s)]
*  All right, guys, we got to talk about helix mattresses. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3397.16s)]
*  Sleep is the single most important thing you can do for your health. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3399.16s)]
*  And I know that because I slept like shit and I keep gaining weight. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3402.16s)]
*  That's probably why. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3405.16s)]
*  But helix mattresses are helping me. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3406.16s)]
*  I got one. I am genuinely sleeping better. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3408.16s)]
*  I fucking love it. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3410.16s)]
*  And the reason I love it is because you take a simple quiz online. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3411.16s)]
*  It takes like two minutes. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3414.16s)]
*  You can take it. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3415.16s)]
*  If you have a partner, they can take it. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3416.16s)]
*  They ask you how you sleep. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3418.16s)]
*  How often do you toss and turn? [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3419.16s)]
*  What position do you sleep in on your stomach, on your back, on your side? [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3420.16s)]
*  And then they match you to the mattress that best fits your needs. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3423.16s)]
*  And then it is shipped right to your door for free. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3427.16s)]
*  And most importantly, you have 100 nights to try it out. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3430.16s)]
*  That is exactly right. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3433.16s)]
*  You sleep on this bed for 100 nights. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3434.16s)]
*  And if you don't like it, you just send it back. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3436.16s)]
*  And if you decide to keep it, which you probably will, [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3437.16s)]
*  there is a 10 to 15 year warranty on your bed. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3439.16s)]
*  10 to 15 years. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3441.16s)]
*  Guys, that's an entire learner's permit to human being. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3442.16s)]
*  Honestly, there is nothing to lose. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3445.16s)]
*  And if you don't believe me, just look up helix online. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3447.16s)]
*  These guys win all kinds of awards and they have over 12,000 five star reviews. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3450.16s)]

*  And just as importantly, helix is offering 20% off all mattress orders [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3455.16s)]

*  Let's get back to the show. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3477.16s)]
*  Don't want to talk about Caitlin Clark's? [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3478.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3479.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3480.16s)]
*  She didn't get picked for the Olympics. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3481.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3482.16s)]
*  She didn't. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3483.16s)]
*  Stupid. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3484.16s)]
*  What do you all think about that? [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3485.16s)]
*  Fucking. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3486.16s)]
*  I actually have a hot take about this. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3487.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3488.16s)]
*  Well, what's yours? [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3489.16s)]
*  Just nobody you could actually take her off for. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3490.16s)]
*  That's what a lot of people will watch the way you're saying. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3492.16s)]
*  They're a very accomplished team. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3494.16s)]
*  The best of the best. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3496.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3497.16s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3498.16s)]
*  Here's my hot take. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3499.16s)]
*  First of all, obviously, retarded move business wise, like absolute idiots not putting on the team just financially, [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3501.16s)]
*  like you're trying to make money for the sport. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3508.16s)]
*  But what I will say is this, right now there's this like little window where like guys care about the WNBA. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3510.16s)]
*  Eventually we'll just stop caring. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3515.16s)]
*  It's like a nice little fucking trend. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3517.16s)]
*  But eventually you'll just be like, eh, whatever. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3519.16s)]
*  And so what they have to do is find a way to convert women into fans as well. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3521.16s)]
*  And the only thing women watch is like chaos and bickering. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3526.16s)]
*  That's the only thing that they watch on TV. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3530.16s)]
*  If there's not champagne being thrown or women yelling at each other and fighting, women pushing each other to the ground, women fouling each other hard. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3532.16s)]
*  The only thing that they care about like are storylines and narratives where like women are fighting with one another. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3541.16s)]
*  And they've kind of turned the WNBA into a reality show. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3546.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3549.16s)]
*  Are these girls on Caitlin's team not supporting her? [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3550.16s)]
*  Are they fighting with her? [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3553.16s)]
*  Does Angel Reese hate Caitlin? [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3554.16s)]
*  Is she jealous that this person's gay? [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3556.16s)]
*  They're turning it into a housewives drama. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3557.16s)]
*  That's the only way to get women to watch the WNBA if they think it's real housewives of the WNBA. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3559.16s)]
*  So I know it seems like it's not working now because all the men watching are like, well, why don't you care about making money? [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3564.16s)]
*  Why don't you care about success? [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3570.16s)]
*  Why don't you care about building a sport? [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3571.16s)]
*  Because that's how we think about something. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3572.16s)]
*  But women just want to see shit destroyed on TV. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3573.16s)]
*  And the fact that they're destroying it, it actually might end up working to gain a female audience. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3576.16s)]
*  That's an interesting take. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3582.16s)]
*  I think, I think. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3583.16s)]
*  Miles and I were talking. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3584.16s)]
*  He had a theory that this is good for fans of Caitlin Clark because you need to see her go through adversity like in the hero's journey. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3585.16s)]
*  It can't just be she gets everything right away. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3592.16s)]
*  She got to be getting bullied. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3594.16s)]
*  She got to have a bad guy. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3595.16s)]
*  Everybody leaves her off the team. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3596.16s)]
*  Yeah, the fans are going to support her even more now because it's like Donald Trump. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3597.16s)]
*  It's like they're trying to take him off the ballot. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3600.16s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3602.16s)]
*  They're trying to stop this girl. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3603.16s)]
*  Like, obviously, you could take one of these old lesbian bitches off the team and throw her in. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3605.16s)]
*  Even if she gets no playing time, she's like on the bench. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3608.16s)]
*  She goes out for three minutes versus Venezuela. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3610.16s)]
*  You just let her drop seven threes and then get ESPN to run it up. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3613.16s)]
*  You can put her on the team. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3616.16s)]
*  Even just like you said, for business and like helping her develop. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3617.16s)]
*  You know, I heard they haven't lost a game since 1992. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3621.16s)]
*  So we really just need to feel the best team or we can take someone who's almost as good. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3624.16s)]
*  Help her be around. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3627.16s)]
*  You know how good it is for male basketball players to be on the national basketball team? [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3628.16s)]
*  LeBron learned so much from Kobe. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3631.16s)]
*  Anthony Edwards learned so much from being on the team last year. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3633.16s)]
*  It always happens. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3635.16s)]
*  Honestly, I would keep her on the team. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3636.16s)]
*  This is me as a man saying it. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3638.16s)]
*  I would keep her on the team to the detriment of the team because it is to the benefit of the sport. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3639.16s)]
*  Yes. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3645.16s)]
*  You remember when Michael Jordan, 1992, was I think the Olympics were in Barcelona. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3646.16s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not mistaken. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3653.16s)]
*  Dream team dreamed. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3654.16s)]
*  This was a celebration of basketball excellence and you seduced the rest of the world with your greatest players. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3657.16s)]
*  Now, I'm not saying that she's the greatest player right now, but she is the most seductive player. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3664.16s)]
*  So exciting. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3668.16s)]
*  See, only when people are talking about let her go out there against these bum ass other countries. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3669.16s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3673.16s)]
*  Like women's sports in other countries is horrible. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3674.16s)]
*  Yeah, because they don't. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3676.16s)]
*  We're they're the most sexist. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3677.16s)]
*  We're the least sexist. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3678.16s)]
*  Yeah, we're the least sexist. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3679.16s)]
*  So they're fucking pretty good at sports. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3680.16s)]
*  But in other countries, they have C-section scars to mend. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3681.16s)]
*  They can't be out there playing. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3685.16s)]
*  They're having families. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3687.16s)]
*  What is this? [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3688.16s)]
*  This is a USA basketball versus Team India. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3689.16s)]
*  There's no fucking way. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3692.16s)]
*  So hilarious. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3694.16s)]
*  There is no fucking way. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3695.16s)]
*  Billions of people couldn't find. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3697.16s)]
*  It's like the American cricket team. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3699.16s)]
*  They just called up a bunch of girls. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3700.16s)]
*  Just show up. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3703.16s)]
*  What's the over under on this? [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3704.16s)]
*  They're the most dominant team. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3705.16s)]
*  You don't even need all the best players. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3707.16s)]
*  What you need is Caitlin Clark, the most marketable player, to go out there and just ball the fuck out. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3709.16s)]
*  And then all the other players in that team are going to make more money because the viewership is going to go up. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3714.16s)]
*  All the other players. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3718.16s)]
*  All the countries are going to be like, oh, maybe we should let women play sports. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3719.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3722.16s)]
*  In since the WNBA has been around, has any player on the Olympic team not been in the WNBA? [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3723.16s)]
*  Because technically this team was forming before, like for the past couple of years. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3731.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3737.16s)]
*  There was one girl from UConn. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3738.16s)]
*  I forget her name. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3739.16s)]
*  There was one girl from UConn who was in her rookie year. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3740.16s)]
*  I forget her name, but it was the UConn coach who selected her. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3743.16s)]
*  So maybe that's why. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3745.16s)]
*  But they had camps early on. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3746.16s)]
*  They had camps months ago when she was in the Final Four and she couldn't go to those camps, obviously, because she was playing and they had formed it there. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3747.16s)]
*  If she'd gone to those camps, I could argue, oh, playing with the other girls. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3754.16s)]
*  Like there's one of the players that's 41 years old. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3758.16s)]
*  There's no rules. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3761.16s)]
*  No rules. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3762.16s)]
*  I just think these. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3763.16s)]
*  Put her on the fucking table. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3764.16s)]
*  If you were on the team, the story would have been like, oh, look, they're giving her a special treatment. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3765.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, they are. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3769.16s)]
*  But that's all they're complaining about now anyway. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3770.16s)]
*  That'd be a story for one day. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3771.16s)]
*  No, they're complaining that they're not giving her favoritism. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3773.16s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3775.16s)]
*  The detractors. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3776.16s)]
*  Even like when a black guy defends Caitlin Clark, people are like, oh, why are you defending those white women? [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3777.16s)]
*  I'm the number one hate on white women person. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3782.16s)]
*  This is what y'all do. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3785.16s)]
*  I'll defend her. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3786.16s)]
*  She's exciting. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3787.16s)]
*  It's the only reason I'm only interested in women's basketball. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3788.16s)]
*  She's pulling up from 40 feet out. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3790.16s)]
*  She's exciting the way Steph Curry is exciting. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3791.16s)]
*  It's fun to watch. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3794.16s)]
*  So if I feel like she should be on a team, I'll say something is not a race thing or whatever. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3795.16s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3799.16s)]
*  These larger conversations. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3800.16s)]
*  You're 100 percent right. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3801.16s)]
*  You're 100 percent right. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3802.16s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3803.16s)]
*  For marketing, you put Caitlin Clark. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3804.16s)]
*  You put Angela Reese. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3806.16s)]
*  Yeah, Angel Reese. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3808.16s)]
*  And you put Cameron Brink. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3809.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3811.16s)]
*  Bare minimum. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3812.16s)]
*  You put those three. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3813.16s)]
*  They're all three of them are superstars. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3814.16s)]
*  I mean, super like they just get it. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3816.16s)]
*  They're on tick. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3819.16s)]
*  They're marketing themselves. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3820.16s)]
*  They're actually care about being bigger. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3821.16s)]
*  Maybe Caitlin is the least of the most like tick tocky of them. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3824.16s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3829.16s)]
*  Like I think Angel and Cameron are like really locked in on social media, which is a good thing. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3830.16s)]
*  I'm not even being critical of it. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3834.16s)]
*  I'm like grow the sport, become bigger personalities. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3835.16s)]
*  You put three of them on a team. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3837.16s)]
*  And when you're beating a team by 50, which you eventually will be beating a team by 50, you let them go in there and ball the fuck out. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3839.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3845.16s)]
*  Like this is a no brainer to grow. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3846.16s)]
*  There are girls in this team that are 41 years old. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3847.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3850.16s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3851.16s)]
*  How many Olympics have that 41 year old? [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3852.16s)]
*  I think five or six. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3855.16s)]
*  I said get the fuck off the team, bitch. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3856.16s)]
*  Get the fuck off the team. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3858.16s)]
*  She was the one when they were doing like she's the one hating on Caitlin. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3860.16s)]
*  They were doing like a simulcast of one of the final four games. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3864.16s)]
*  Shut your ass up. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3866.16s)]
*  She's not going to be that good in the pros. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3867.16s)]
*  These are grown women. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3869.16s)]
*  She's going against us. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3870.16s)]
*  Not going to be off the team. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3871.16s)]
*  You know, fucking hating you old bitches over. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3872.16s)]
*  Go home. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3874.16s)]
*  But didn't I thought I read a thing that she put up as many numbers as her numbers are about are comparable. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3875.16s)]
*  You're 41. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3879.16s)]
*  If you're 41, you could go home. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3880.16s)]
*  Who's the 41 year old? [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3881.16s)]
*  Diana Tarassi. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=3882.16s)]

*  Oh, I mean somebody's going to get hurt and then maybe somebody's probably going to get [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4024.16s)]
*  hurt and then maybe she'll be the first call. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4027.16s)]
*  You've got to just put her on the fucking team. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4028.16s)]
*  What are we doing here? [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4030.16s)]

*  What are we doing here? [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4033.16s)]
*  All three of them. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4034.16s)]
*  It's too late at this point. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4035.16s)]
*  No, but if there's injuries where people step down or like... [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4036.16s)]
*  I mean, if I'm like the Federation or whatever, I go up to some of the girls and I go, girls, [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4038.16s)]
*  sit the fuck down, take the fucking summer off. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4043.16s)]
*  You can come as a coach. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4045.16s)]
*  Just say, hey, we can still be there or some other thing. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4047.16s)]
*  If you just want to travel, you'll still be there. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4049.16s)]
*  You'll get a fucking medal, do whatever you want. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4051.16s)]
*  But these young chicks need to go out there and get it done. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4053.16s)]
*  This is what's going to take the sport to the next level. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4056.16s)]
*  And it will. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4059.16s)]
*  I mean, that's what Jordan did. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4060.16s)]
*  That's what Magic and Bird did. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4061.16s)]
*  That's what Kyrie is doing. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4062.16s)]
*  That's what Steph did. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4063.16s)]
*  That's what LeBron did. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4064.16s)]
*  You have to pass the torch. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4065.16s)]
*  You have to. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4067.16s)]
*  Because if the game was where it needed to be, then we wouldn't be talking about these [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4068.16s)]
*  three new chicks. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4073.16s)]
*  The fact is, we're talking about the WNBA. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4075.16s)]

*  Your choice. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4081.16s)]
*  Also, guys, when we're talking about Caitlin Clark dominating on the court, we should mention [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4082.16s)]
*  Morgan & Morgan, who dominates in the court. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4086.16s)]
*  They are America's largest injury law firm. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4088.16s)]
*  They recovered over $20 billion for over 500,000 clients. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4090.16s)]
*  So check out Morgan & Morgan whenever you get a chance. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4094.16s)]
*  Let's get back to it. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4096.16s)]

*  Like if they start really like going at it, real house-wide style, I think chicks will [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4099.16s)]
*  watch it 100%. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4102.16s)]

*  media. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4108.16s)]
*  I think girls would really watch that. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4109.16s)]
*  And I think they would prefer that to watching elite basketball. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4110.16s)]
*  Mid-game interviews? [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4113.16s)]

*  Like, yeah, the mid-game interviews should be like the... [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4119.16s)]
*  It should be a confessional. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4121.16s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4122.16s)]
*  There's a background behind her green screen. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4123.16s)]
*  No, what's that shit where they come at the end of the season? [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4124.16s)]

*  Oh, watch what happens or the reunion. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4134.16s)]
*  Reunion, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4136.16s)]

*  Oh, yes. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4147.16s)]
*  Yeah, you were right. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4148.16s)]
*  Bad boys flop. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4149.16s)]
*  Did I say it was going to flop? [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4150.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4151.16s)]
*  I think... [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4152.16s)]
*  You were incredibly wrong. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4153.16s)]
*  Well, no, no, not incredibly. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4154.16s)]
*  Here, let's go. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4155.16s)]
*  Because what I believe I said was, I think it could do what we would consider well for [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4157.16s)]
*  now, but not what we would consider well for a major action movie weekend. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4165.16s)]
*  And I think that's what's happening. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4173.16s)]
*  Like this 100 million... [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4174.84s)]
*  50 million opening weekend, right? [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4176.84s)]
*  I think it was 100 million overall. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4178.32s)]
*  104. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4180.16s)]
*  104 overall. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4181.16s)]
*  105. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4182.16s)]
*  Whatever. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4183.16s)]
*  Whatever. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4184.16s)]
*  And I think this number is indicative of the fact that overall numbers are much less. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4185.16s)]
*  In the same way that when someone drops an album and it does like 50,000 streams, they're [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4193.76s)]
*  the number one album. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4196.8s)]
*  Back in the day, it had to do a million buys. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4197.8s)]
*  So I think it's just overall, it's a great number. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4201.16s)]
*  I think it's awesome. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4203.639999999999s)]
*  It still shows that the franchise has value. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4204.639999999999s)]
*  It shows that Will and Martin have value. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4206.16s)]
*  And I'm sure they made a good movie. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4207.84s)]
*  But if I'm looking at this as an exec, I'm not going, movies are back. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4210.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm going, we got to make a big adjustment. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4214.28s)]
*  Because we sent these guys around the world on the craziest promo tour ever. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4218.84s)]
*  And it did well on an established franchise that has been around for, what is this, fucking [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4223.0s)]
*  20 years or something like that. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4228.08s)]
*  And then we hit that 100 mark. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4230.76s)]
*  And then we'll see what happens next week. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4232.12s)]
*  It might go off a fucking cliff. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4233.72s)]
*  But I'm looking at that as an exec and I'm going, okay, we need to change this whole [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4237.26s)]
*  fucking thing up. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4240.42s)]
*  Either movies got to get way less expensive or we just need to start putting shit on streaming [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4241.42s)]
*  and find a different way to make money off of it. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4246.02s)]
*  Yeah, I'm curious to see the next week. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4247.9400000000005s)]
*  I think it will, it's not going to stay exactly there, but I don't think it's going to have [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4249.34s)]
*  a steep drop off because the movie's good. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4252.7s)]
*  And I think a lot of people didn't go out because three wasn't that great. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4255.740000000001s)]
*  So they were like, so they're like hesitant. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4259.14s)]
*  Then when it did well, people like, okay, I'll go. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4260.780000000001s)]
*  And the feedback has been good. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4263.1s)]
*  Is Will forgiven or is everybody all good with Will? [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4264.1s)]
*  I think Will needs one more after this. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4267.22s)]
*  Like I think this has come back. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4269.780000000001s)]
*  Now we're like, oh, Will, my God, it's still. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4271.02s)]
*  And if the next one is crazy, then I think we're like, [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4272.700000000001s)]
*  Are you really that mad at Will? [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4277.46s)]
*  I think we're, I think we're let down. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4279.740000000001s)]
*  We're like disappointed. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4281.660000000001s)]
*  I don't think it's the slap. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4283.54s)]
*  I think it's his relationship with her. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4285.18s)]
*  I think like, I thought it was the slap. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4287.38s)]
*  No, I don't give a fuck about the slap. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4289.06s)]
*  I do. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4290.820000000001s)]
*  That's what Hollywood cares about. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4291.34s)]
*  Oh, I don't care about that. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4293.02s)]
*  I just like being in this relationship with this woman [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4294.3s)]
*  who's like clearly like toxic and abusive. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4296.900000000001s)]
*  Like I'm just like, you're a leading man. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4299.740000000001s)]
*  You're a superstar. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4301.9800000000005s)]
*  You're. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4302.9400000000005s)]
*  I think we feel their relationship was fraudulent. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4303.42s)]
*  We feel betrayed by like what they portray. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4305.22s)]
*  So it's like if he has another box office hit and he's still with Jada, [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4307.22s)]
*  you're still going to feel the same way. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4311.1s)]
*  It's not going to change anything in your heart. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4312.1s)]
*  I think that they're way less public about their relationship. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4314.14s)]
*  Like now it just seems like Will is an entity and then she's doing [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4317.38s)]
*  whatever they're doing, but it's not like every week we're going to talk about [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4320.9800000000005s)]
*  why our marriage sucks on Red Table Talk or whatever. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4323.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4325.66s)]
*  You know, I don't even know if that shit is still going on. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4326.14s)]
*  So it's like, I think and that's better because then we can ignore the fact [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4328.74s)]
*  that she's even alive because when, no, like when you look at, like when you [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4332.1s)]
*  look at the rock as like a superhero, you're like, I need to believe you are [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4336.82s)]
*  all the things of a superhero. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4340.06s)]
*  If I find out that like your wife is saying wild shit and having affairs [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4342.14s)]
*  and doing all this other stuff, am I really going to believe you're the man [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4345.86s)]
*  when you're playing the leading dude in the action movie? [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4348.38s)]
*  I get that. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4351.14s)]
*  I can't. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4351.7s)]
*  I get that. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4352.26s)]
*  It like, we, we like to believe that these people are actors, but like Vince [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4352.94s)]
*  Vaughn is Vince Vaughn in every movie to me. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4358.38s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4361.58s)]
*  Like Vince Vaughn is the Vince Vaughn from Swingers. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4362.0199999999995s)]
*  If I found out Vince had no game, I'd be like, what, what the fuck? [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4364.099999999999s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4366.74s)]
*  Like what's the guy from, uh, uh, uh, uh, entourage? [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4367.98s)]
*  Vincent Chase? [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4375.58s)]
*  No, the, uh, agent. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4376.34s)]
*  Oh, Jeremy Piven. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4378.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4379.3s)]
*  Jeremy Piven. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4379.5s)]
*  When I found out he kind of like a little bit of like a nerd, I'm like, oh, like [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4380.66s)]
*  what he was on here, I thought he was like doing like a career. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4387.1s)]
*  He was on our pod. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4391.1s)]
*  What? [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4391.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4392.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4392.26s)]
*  He was doing like a little career revival and some of the lines he had, I was like, [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4392.780000000001s)]
*  oh, this is your stock line. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4396.18s)]
*  And he just kept being like, I'm just a working class actor from Chicago. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4397.22s)]
*  And then the third I was in, but then like the third time he said it, I went home [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4399.780000000001s)]
*  and I was like, oh, that's his like comeback line. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4402.9800000000005s)]
*  Like he's taking this to whatever press he does. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4405.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4406.62s)]
*  But you know, nice enough guy, but yeah, I do. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4407.06s)]
*  He's like, he's like an artsy theater nerd that like played this character that was [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4408.82s)]
*  awesome. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4413.54s)]
*  And then once I found out that there was this massive chasm between those two, I [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4414.42s)]
*  was like, ah, and I think that happened with Will a little bit, but like Will was [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4417.78s)]
*  the first Prince of Bel Air to me. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4423.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4424.74s)]
*  Like that's who he was. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4425.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4426.18s)]
*  Like the coolest, the fucking coolest dude. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4427.0599999999995s)]
*  And not only the cool and he was a cool dude who was like also self-deprecating [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4429.62s)]
*  and funny, like he wasn't like, I need to be the cool guy and every, he's not [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4433.94s)]
*  like a, not to knock him, but like a Johnny Depp figure where you're like, I'm [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4438.42s)]
*  in this mysterious, whatever. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4441.74s)]
*  He was like open. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4443.34s)]
*  Personable, kind of goofy. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4444.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4445.9400000000005s)]
*  Goofy, self-deprecating, vulnerable, but also saves the day. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4446.14s)]
*  I'm like, you're the best, you're the fuck. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4450.42s)]
*  And then you see him in this marriage that kind of sucks and she's fucking [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4452.9800000000005s)]
*  R&B stars. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4455.46s)]
*  And then the slap is a manifestation of all of it. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4456.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4458.9400000000005s)]
*  Not being able to control your emotions in that moment. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4459.54s)]
*  Like for her. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4461.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4463.46s)]
*  Like, whatever. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4464.06s)]
*  Seeing him in person, I feel like we're getting the old Will. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4465.0199999999995s)]
*  Getting closer. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4468.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4469.139999999999s)]
*  I think deep down we all want it. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4469.7s)]
*  Like, if you fell in love with this guy. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4470.94s)]
*  Charlie actually had the take that gave me the most empathy, which was like when he said, [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4473.66s)]
*  Will would see his mom get slapped and felt like he never protected her and that always [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4476.54s)]
*  bothered him. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4479.339999999999s)]
*  And you wonder if that's what's flashing through his mind when he sees Jay to react. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4480.0599999999995s)]
*  That was the first time I had any, I was like, oh, okay. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4483.259999999999s)]
*  But yeah, I do think maybe it's because deep down I want him to be back and I want [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4487.0599999999995s)]
*  to love him again and whatever, because I used to fucking love him. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4491.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4493.54s)]
*  And then, yeah, you do find out it's all phony. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4494.1s)]
*  Like she's having sex with your son's friends and you're just sitting there. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4496.18s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4499.620000000001s)]
*  Just weird. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4500.18s)]
*  Just weird. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4501.3s)]
*  Mark, can you hand me that one? [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4501.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4502.900000000001s)]
*  So I think that everybody wants him to be that and it would be awesome if this did well. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4503.1s)]
*  And I don't even know where this ends up going, but I do think that the movie industry, [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4510.06s)]
*  I think we were talking about this one, was it Patreon? [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4515.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4516.660000000001s)]
*  But like, I think we're about to enter like the greatest two decades of a film. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4517.74s)]
*  You know how we just are in the greatest two decades of TV? [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4524.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4527.74s)]
*  Like TV was incredible. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4528.54s)]
*  Maybe it's the greatest decade. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4530.5s)]
*  Maybe it's two. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4531.62s)]
*  No, it's two thousand or something like that. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4532.339999999999s)]
*  Like 25 years of fantastic TV. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4534.5s)]
*  We're spoiled. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4537.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4538.0199999999995s)]
*  Like spoiled even internationally. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4538.46s)]
*  Like the fact that that show came out of fucking Korea that we all watch. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4540.379999999999s)]
*  Squid Game. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4543.98s)]
*  Squid Game. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4544.379999999999s)]
*  There's these British show, Luther. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4545.54s)]
*  Like Luther's unbelievable. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4547.02s)]
*  Globally. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4548.3s)]
*  Sherlock, two seasons, unbelievable. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4548.9800000000005s)]
*  Great. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4550.820000000001s)]
*  It's like we had this incredible run with TV and I think we're about to enter that with [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4551.06s)]
*  film. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4554.62s)]
*  And I think it's specifically because the studios won't be able to justify these crazy [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4554.9800000000005s)]
*  budgets. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4560.18s)]
*  So the budget is going to come down and then Marvel is going to go, well, I can't make [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4560.740000000001s)]
*  the movie for 20 million. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4563.820000000001s)]
*  But you know what I can make is this cool script, this amazing story, and then this [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4565.26s)]
*  awesome director that really wants to tell the story. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4570.700000000001s)]
*  And then you get to everything everywhere all at once and you get a bunch more of those. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4572.74s)]
*  And I think it was Cassetta that was saying like during the 80s, this is kind of what [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4576.139999999999s)]
*  happened. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4579.54s)]
*  You had all these like classic iconic movies that weren't necessarily these huge [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4580.139999999999s)]
*  franchises, but these like really great stories. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4583.26s)]
*  And I think we get that for the next 20 years and 70s with cinema nouveau. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4585.9s)]
*  What is that Cassetta? [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4589.42s)]
*  But I mean, it's just basically French influence over American cinema. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4590.66s)]
*  And you have Spielberg, you have Francis Ford, Coppola, you have all these, you know, [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4594.86s)]
*  Martin Scorsese. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4598.74s)]
*  Let me tell you something Cassetta. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4600.139999999999s)]
*  One thing we're not going to do in this podcast is give the French credit for anything. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4601.74s)]
*  OK, you hear me? [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4606.26s)]
*  Yeah, I got you. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4610.78s)]
*  No, but but the fact that you did have this like I don't even want to want to call it [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4612.98s)]
*  like Renaissance, but you have this like amazing moment. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4617.18s)]
*  I think that budgets are going to make that happen. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4619.7s)]
*  It's not execs, right? [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4622.0599999999995s)]
*  Like the execs are going to greenlight what they can greenlight. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4623.82s)]
*  And then once they find out they just can't afford these big money movie things, they're [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4626.34s)]
*  going to have to give money to these eight twenty four esque movies. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4630.26s)]
*  What is it? Neon is the other one. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4634.06s)]
*  They're kind of like taking chances. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4635.58s)]
*  I think we get some sick shit. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4637.38s)]
*  How much of these Marvel movies flopping is their own doing? [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4639.74s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4643.66s)]
*  I hate to be the fucking guy who talks about like DEI or whatever, but it feels like they're [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4645.38s)]
*  forcing a lot of storylines that are just like trying to spotlight more inclusive stuff [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4648.66s)]
*  at the expense of good storytelling and organic storytelling and being funny and whatever, [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4654.62s)]
*  whatever other thing. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4659.54s)]
*  My opinion is that the majority of it is they're trying to make hits out of characters that [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4660.3s)]
*  have weren't really established. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4666.02s)]
*  Whereas Gogo Thor. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4668.5s)]
*  I don't remember any of us really giving a fuck about Thor before Thor. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4670.46s)]
*  Iron Man. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4674.42s)]
*  I don't remember like maybe comic book freaks, but the casual person Superman, Batman, [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4675.46s)]
*  Spider-Man, X-Men oversaturated themselves here. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4679.58s)]
*  OK, I think there's something there, too. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4682.26s)]
*  But what I will say is this. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4683.62s)]
*  We weren't like fans of Thor, but we all knew Thor. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4685.62s)]
*  We weren't fans of Iron Man. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4689.38s)]
*  I think there were Iron Man fans, but we all knew of Iron Man. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4691.820000000001s)]
*  One more example to counter this. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4694.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4696.22s)]
*  I had no fucking clue who the Guardians of the Galaxy were. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4696.7s)]
*  And that shit was so good. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4699.26s)]
*  One was fucking amazing. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4701.46s)]
*  Three was fucking amazing. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4702.78s)]
*  Two I didn't love, but I'll give you I'll give you Guardians of the Galaxy 100 percent. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4703.78s)]
*  I do think Guardians of the Galaxy is the beneficiary of billion dollar franchise after [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4706.820000000001s)]
*  billion dollar franchise and just like a confidence in the institution. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4712.9800000000005s)]
*  And then I think that they start putting out the Marvels or whatever, whatever these [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4717.86s)]
*  these things that like I have no fucking clue. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4722.38s)]
*  Like I grew up watching Sunday cartoons or whatever. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4725.58s)]
*  Like I watched X-Men. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4728.7s)]
*  I watched it like I have no clue who the Marvels are. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4730.22s)]
*  I have no clue any of these characters. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4733.46s)]
*  So now you've got to like introduce them, make us fall in love with them. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4735.1s)]
*  And while you're doing that, it seems like it's diversity forced down our throat. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4738.7s)]
*  I even felt that about the Doctor Strange sequel when I loved the first Doctor Strange [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4744.02s)]
*  the second one. I was like, it just feels like they're forcing. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4747.42s)]
*  And again, I don't want to be that guy. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4749.82s)]
*  But it was like, you know, it's just forcing it. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4751.74s)]
*  It's not organic. It's not good storytelling anymore. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4753.26s)]
*  It just became something else. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4755.46s)]
*  And I'm watching it on a plane and I'm like, I don't want to finish this. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4756.74s)]
*  But Disney buys. Oh, go ahead. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4760.26s)]
*  Oh, I feel like it's over saturation because like when Iron Man one came out, like we got [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4761.54s)]
*  a Marvel movie maybe once a year, maybe sometimes twice a year. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4766.74s)]
*  That's it. And so it was so much easier for people to take a chance on this thing, like [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4770.54s)]
*  make it and follow and keep keep along the storyline after they started making three, [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4776.1s)]
*  four movies a year plus TV shows. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4781.06s)]
*  And then they all kind of tied into one another. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4783.660000000001s)]
*  If you miss one thing, you kind of feel like, oh, damn, I'm lost from the storyline. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4785.900000000001s)]
*  So now I'm least less invested to try the next movie that is that devil. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4790.38s)]
*  You're going to say on that it was when that was coming out, you've got a master [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4794.42s)]
*  that was connecting everything like Kevin Feige from Marvel, who was connecting [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4799.22s)]
*  everything and then would like get to supervise that movie and that director. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4802.62s)]
*  So it's like Favreau. That was his world forever. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4806.3s)]
*  But as soon as they expanded to digital streaming everything, it's like you can't have [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4809.5s)]
*  the same touch on everything. And you're you know, you're just going to lose quality at [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4814.3s)]
*  that point. And then people like, oh, we'll have some wins and some losses instead of [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4818.3s)]
*  like who still only has wins is Pixar because Pixar is ready to throw out. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4821.62s)]
*  No, that was Chiftee's great point. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4826.5s)]
*  There's a one or two misses for sure. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4828.0199999999995s)]
*  But I saw a question. Who watches Star Wars? [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4829.82s)]
*  I like they keep on putting out. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4832.5s)]
*  Are you like, I fucked up. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4836.02s)]
*  They put out too much, apparently, there as well. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4838.06s)]
*  Well, not much. They put out a new series. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4839.860000000001s)]
*  It feels like every month I barely watch Star Wars. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4842.26s)]
*  I am not watching the acolyte or whatever the fuck the newest. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4846.06s)]
*  No, it's not. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4849.9800000000005s)]
*  But like, maybe I'm living in a completely separate world. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4851.54s)]
*  Maybe there's like an age range. I just miss something. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4855.62s)]
*  I've watched all the Star Wars movies. I watched when they brought out. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4858.02s)]
*  Remember, they did the prequels, I think, when we were younger. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4860.98s)]
*  Yeah, I watched every single one of them. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4863.259999999999s)]
*  But I was never invested in this entire world. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4864.62s)]
*  Disney operates as if Star Wars is Marvel. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4867.78s)]
*  Is it Marvel? And I'm just out the loop to Star Wars fans. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4871.299999999999s)]
*  Yes, it is. And are there enough Star Wars fans to justify it? [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4874.78s)]
*  Or are they biting off more than they could chew? [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4877.62s)]
*  I think so. It's still a major franchise. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4879.82s)]
*  I don't think it's as big as Marvel, but dude, Star Wars in the 70s and 80s was. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4881.78s)]
*  I recognize at that time it was the craziest Marvel then. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4886.099999999999s)]
*  But does the thirst justify the fact that they're making all these shows? [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4889.900000000001s)]
*  I feel like they do less than Marvel. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4893.66s)]
*  Like Marvel comes out with way more shit than Star Wars. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4895.34s)]
*  Star Wars is just doing TV shows because it's probably easier budget than movies and content. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4897.9800000000005s)]
*  And that's why we're selling that. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4901.860000000001s)]
*  And they need shit for Disney Plus. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4902.9400000000005s)]
*  But even like what you're saying about Acolyte being good. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4904.14s)]
*  When was the last Marvel property? [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4906.7s)]
*  I can think of one in the past two, three years. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4908.22s)]
*  It's been the mini Yoda. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4910.9400000000005s)]
*  No, Marvel, Marvel, which was that's man, the Spider-Man cartoon. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4912.82s)]
*  Oh, I thought you said you could think of one. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4915.74s)]
*  Just to my Marvel point, like I can't think of anybody being like, oh, this Marvel shit is fine. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4917.3s)]
*  And that Spider-Man cartoon is barely Marvel. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4920.7s)]
*  It's Sony had to get purchased by Marvel in order for them to make it like Spider-Man. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4923.900000000001s)]
*  Just became part of the franchise. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4928.02s)]
*  So Marvel has been full of characters. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4929.66s)]
*  Say again. Back in the 90s, Marvel sold off all the rights to the good characters. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4932.62s)]
*  And then the fact that they made this whole new Marvel universe to a point [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4935.66s)]
*  with the B characters, with the B characters, Iron Man, all that type of shit is insane. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4940.18s)]
*  All their good characters got lost early on. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4944.780000000001s)]
*  So it is very well Spider-Man. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4947.14s)]
*  Who else? Spider-Man X-Men was off Incredible Hulk. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4949.14s)]
*  They don't really have access to. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4951.900000000001s)]
*  They got them all back in the 2010s as like rights and exclusivities. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4953.14s)]
*  Yeah. But in the beginning, it was Iron Man. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4957.54s)]
*  Like, that's a crazy character. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4959.780000000001s)]
*  Now, what they would I don't think I know it sounds crazy, [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4960.860000000001s)]
*  but I don't think Marvel gets enough credit for what they put put together. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4963.9800000000005s)]
*  Like, I think they put together like the greatest run of films. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4966.820000000001s)]
*  And I mean, they dominated cinema. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4969.22s)]
*  They they kept cinema afloat for a decade. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4970.740000000001s)]
*  It was and they wrapped it up perfectly. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4973.02s)]
*  Like what they did was the fact that this guy came back to work. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4975.5s)]
*  What the fuck is his name? [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4979.58s)]
*  The Marvel guy, James Gunn, Robert Downey Jr. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4981.42s)]
*  No, no, no. Feige orchestrated the guy who runs Disney. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4984.74s)]
*  Bob Iger. The fact that Iger came back to you put out Endgame [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4989.5s)]
*  and then you go to St. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4993.54s)]
*  Bart's and you just live there. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4995.38s)]
*  Now, I think they bought Marvel after, right? [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4996.98s)]
*  They bought Marvel, if I'm not mistaken. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=4999.3s)]
*  Who? Who? Who? Yeah. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5000.86s)]
*  Iger bought Marvel. Correct. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5002.02s)]
*  So Iger wasn't involved. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5003.42s)]
*  He bought Marvel. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5004.46s)]
*  And now they shoot his trash. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5005.42s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, but they developed those. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5006.94s)]
*  No, Iger was part of that whole run. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5009.42s)]
*  OK, yeah. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5012.58s)]
*  So what I'm saying is an Iger was at the helm of Disney during that whole. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5013.54s)]
*  Two thousand nine Disney bought Marvel. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5017.82s)]
*  OK, yeah. And then so throughout that process. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5019.78s)]
*  Now, Feige deserves the credit, too. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5022.62s)]
*  But my point is he retired after and it was like, whoa, you had your Jordan moment. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5024.1s)]
*  Like, yeah, you're going off to the sunset. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5027.7s)]
*  You hit the game winner and you just fucking leave. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5029.26s)]
*  And then he came back like a year ago. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5030.9s)]
*  Because if you care about the company and then you see the company on the decline. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5033.86s)]
*  Yeah. Loki, I respect that. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5037.0199999999995s)]
*  Like, maybe it's like, wow, this is my legacy. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5038.62s)]
*  I built this thing. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5040.82s)]
*  And then they're going to throw it all away on fucking tranny's [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5041.62s)]
*  that it needs to be in the thing. Yeah. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5045.74s)]
*  Like, can we just acknowledge that when you see a trans character in a movie [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5047.78s)]
*  and nobody acts as if they're trans, it is incredibly unnatural. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5052.5s)]
*  You're breaking the fourth wall. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5057.0599999999995s)]
*  You are so fucking weird. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5058.66s)]
*  No, no, no, because let me tell you the reality. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5060.42s)]
*  Let me say when you see a trans person in person, you're like, [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5062.26s)]
*  Tranny, like, what do you talk? [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5064.46s)]
*  You act like a regular person. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5066.14s)]
*  No, can I? Oh, are you going to do that now? [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5067.34s)]
*  Let me just let me get this out. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5069.46s)]
*  Are you going to do that right now? [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5070.66s)]
*  Because what happens is this, they walk by, you don't say anything. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5072.06s)]
*  And then you immediately tap whoever's with you. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5074.58s)]
*  And there's none of that in the world, which is OK, which is in your brain. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5076.42s)]
*  You think about it. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5083.42s)]
*  So what it happens is in the brain, they can't show that in a movie. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5084.02s)]
*  My point is the whole world deflates. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5086.860000000001s)]
*  They should. They should do inside out and go into the character's brain. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5089.06s)]
*  I'm watching Fallout, right? [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5092.26s)]
*  And there's like a pretty ass tranny in Fallout. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5093.62s)]
*  That's a nuclear holocaust. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5095.9800000000005s)]
*  So that actually could track that. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5096.9400000000005s)]
*  Could track which one's a lot of, you know, [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5098.9800000000005s)]
*  did you watch Fallout? I did. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5102.62s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. Hold up. Whoa. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5104.54s)]
*  Pull it up. Wait, wait. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5106.34s)]
*  Was it the hot girl? [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5108.38s)]
*  Oh, you jerked off to the wrong person. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5109.3s)]
*  It's not the alien bitch, right? [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5110.46s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5111.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh, OK. I'm like, don't call her a bitch. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5113.1s)]
*  That's Ella Pernell. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5116.3s)]
*  That's Ella Pernell. You watch her fucking mouth. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5117.66s)]
*  That's Lucy McLean. That's Lucy McLean. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5119.98s)]
*  You watch her fucking mouth. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5122.58s)]
*  She's a bad bitch. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5124.099999999999s)]
*  Hey, don't you call her a bitch. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5125.099999999999s)]
*  OK. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5128.5s)]
*  No. OK. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5129.5s)]
*  Fucking vault dweller. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5133.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. That one. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5135.099999999999s)]
*  I didn't even see this person. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5138.139999999999s)]
*  You're lying. You're lying. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5140.5s)]
*  Sometimes I just. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5142.58s)]
*  I hate this fucking. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5144.5s)]
*  No, no, no, no. I get it. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5146.379999999999s)]
*  I get it. All the decisions is my friend. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5147.9s)]
*  And we. No, you know, you think I'm trying to do that. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5150.299999999999s)]
*  You think I'm trying to do the. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5153.099999999999s)]

*  Like one of the guys, the guy goes to his friend like. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5257.86s)]
*  Here's an example. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5259.7s)]
*  Would you bite? [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5260.7s)]
*  Like, yes. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5261.7s)]
*  Something like that. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5262.9s)]
*  Yeah, something. Here's an example. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5263.46s)]
*  I used to go on stage in these hood rooms. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5264.78s)]
*  I would never address the fact that I'm Indian [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5266.58s)]
*  and none of them have seen an Indian outside of their bodega. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5268.42s)]
*  And I would bomb. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5271.0599999999995s)]
*  And then I realized one day, oh, I just need to address that. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5271.98s)]
*  Like if a guy of a comic came up in a wheelchair, [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5275.0199999999995s)]
*  did an hour of jokes and never once mentioned the wheelchair, [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5277.86s)]
*  wouldn't you as an audience member be like, [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5280.62s)]
*  can we acknowledge we don't see this very often? [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5282.62s)]
*  That's all we just acknowledge. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5284.66s)]
*  We don't see this very often. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5285.86s)]
*  So the fact that you don't even know. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5286.82s)]
*  Go, go, go. Sorry. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5288.139999999999s)]
*  Then I went back and as I was like kind of having a moment myself [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5288.94s)]
*  being like, why, why am I doing this? [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5291.9s)]
*  I'm going back through every comedy special of a minority. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5293.66s)]
*  The first joke is addressing their race because I'm just addressing this thing. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5296.66s)]
*  I'm different than most of you. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5300.22s)]
*  Let's just acknowledge it. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5301.42s)]
*  And then we move on. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5302.38s)]
*  That's what he's saying. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5303.7s)]
*  Let's acknowledge I'm different than most of you. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5304.58s)]
*  Not good or bad. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5307.82s)]
*  I'm just different. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5308.82s)]
*  You don't see it. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5309.66s)]
*  So then we move on. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5310.18s)]
*  If a little mermaid where she's black. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5311.62s)]
*  Yo, yo, can I? [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5313.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it's not because the mermaid is different. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5314.18s)]
*  Not because they just are different. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5317.42s)]
*  Exactly. It's not weird. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5318.82s)]
*  So you just watch it. You accept it. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5320.14s)]
*  If there's one black mermaid and everybody else, [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5321.7s)]
*  let me let me tell you some shit. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5324.5s)]
*  Let me tell you some shit. OK. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5325.94s)]
*  Imagine a little mermaid on Earth. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5328.099999999999s)]
*  They don't acknowledge she a mermaid. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5329.5s)]
*  That's what you all are saying. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5330.78s)]
*  Like I've never seen a mermaid walking around on Earth in the show. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5332.22s)]
*  In the show, they they're bullying this dude for being the rookie. Right. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5335.5s)]
*  They're in fallout. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5339.46s)]

*  tease, bully, physically abuse and harm a dude. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5348.26s)]
*  And then they got a motherfucking envy. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5352.860000000001s)]
*  It's a non-binary person. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5356.34s)]
*  They got that. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5358.14s)]

*  Everybody's pals. Everybody's cool. Everybody's high fiving. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5370.3s)]
*  That's not a reality that we live in. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5373.34s)]
*  If you if you speak to like army dudes, they'll say all jokes go. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5375.22s)]
*  The black jokes are going with the black dudes. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5378.62s)]

*  They could very easily cosign something that they could make the joke about themselves. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5534.82s)]
*  They can make the joke. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5538.62s)]
*  And if it's all jokes flying in the military, they're bullying the guys. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5539.62s)]
*  They make a black joke. They make a trans joke. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5542.94s)]
*  If the joke ain't transphobic. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5544.66s)]
*  That actually shows we all get these jokes are all equal. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5546.06s)]
*  I promise there's a way to do it. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5547.98s)]
*  I promise. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5549.98s)]

*  Hold on. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5556.98s)]
*  So. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5557.98s)]
*  What? [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5558.98s)]
*  He's a dude. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5559.98s)]
*  He's a dude in real life. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5560.98s)]
*  He's described as a big strong burly man. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5561.98s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5563.78s)]
*  So of course. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5564.78s)]
*  In the video game there is a robot that identifies as a woman. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5565.78s)]
*  I just want to point that out. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5567.66s)]
*  There's a robot? [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5568.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5569.66s)]

*  And Fallout 4. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5571.66s)]
*  So. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5572.66s)]
*  So. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5573.66s)]
*  You're going to complain about that. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5574.66s)]
*  My point is. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5575.66s)]
*  So what they have is they've put a trans person in there. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5577.0599999999995s)]
*  And they have made them. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5580.62s)]

*  You just called them it. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5591.26s)]
*  I don't know what she identifies as or he. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5593.099999999999s)]
*  They. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5595.34s)]

*  And now God knows your heart. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5606.58s)]
*  It's an end. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5608.14s)]

*  I would fuck even though you're clearly a guy because that's what you say. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5691.5s)]
*  But he would fight you if he was here right now. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5694.7s)]
*  He'd be like, oh, you're going to try to fuck me. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5696.78s)]
*  He'd probably fuck me up because he's a dude. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5698.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5701.06s)]
*  But if he didn't and wanted to make love and I wasn't married with a child, you would get [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5702.06s)]
*  some thrust. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5705.5s)]
*  Once he whacks that stash, you would get some thrust. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5710.5s)]
*  My point is the fact that this is so confusing. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5715.06s)]
*  This would be the only conversation that would happen on base. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5718.02s)]
*  The only conversation. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5722.38s)]
*  I can't wait to see a movie. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5723.38s)]
*  You can also easily write a transphobic character that he dunks on. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5726.9800000000005s)]
*  That'd be very easy. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5730.1s)]
*  And matter of fact, basically what you're saying is you can't have a movie with racism [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5731.42s)]
*  because it's going to be about black racism because it's going to have racist comments. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5735.1s)]
*  No, no, I'm not saying that. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5737.9400000000005s)]
*  I do agree. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5739.660000000001s)]
*  That's why. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5740.660000000001s)]
*  How can you not handle it? [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5741.660000000001s)]
*  There's no way to do it. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5742.660000000001s)]
*  Hey, write Django. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5743.660000000001s)]
*  Everything you say is going to be in a film. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5744.660000000001s)]
*  No racism. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5746.660000000001s)]
*  I said that you can address it, but the examples you got. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5748.3s)]
*  No, you said you can't. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5751.099999999999s)]
*  You said you can't. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5752.099999999999s)]
*  Put the trannies in the movies. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5753.099999999999s)]
*  Put them in the TV shows. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5755.5s)]
*  But have the characters react organically to them. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5756.9s)]
*  That's all I'm saying. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5761.38s)]
*  Is that a dude or a girl? [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5762.38s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5763.38s)]
*  Throw an apple. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5764.38s)]
*  See if they catch it. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5765.38s)]
*  That's it. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5766.38s)]
*  Simple as that. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5767.38s)]
*  That's all you do. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5768.38s)]
*  Hollywood, hire. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5769.38s)]
*  It doesn't mean that you treat them poorly. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5770.38s)]
*  It doesn't mean that you're mean to them. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5772.38s)]
*  It doesn't mean that you bully them. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5773.54s)]
*  When they're not there, there's the little conversation where you're like, yo, would [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5775.139999999999s)]
*  you smash that fucking dude pussy or what? [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5778.339999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5781.339999999999s)]
*  There's just a little combo about that. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5783.339999999999s)]
*  And the answer is, si se puede. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5785.339999999999s)]
*  Si se puede, carnal. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5788.339999999999s)]
*  Okay, Caseta? [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5795.339999999999s)]
*  You're half Indian, half what? [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5796.339999999999s)]
*  Yo, that still bothers me. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5797.339999999999s)]
*  Spanish. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5799.339999999999s)]
*  That bothers me more than the trance. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5800.339999999999s)]
*  Nah, Spanish. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5801.339999999999s)]
*  Mendes Jones? [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5802.78s)]
*  Zelia Mendes Jones? [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5803.78s)]
*  She could be going. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5804.78s)]
*  He could be going. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5805.78s)]
*  Nah, he was one of those witches that they ask you for donations. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5806.78s)]
*  Oh, no, no, no. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5811.78s)]
*  Stop, stop, stop, stop. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5812.78s)]
*  You're gonna scare Arcos. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5813.78s)]
*  He's gonna ask you. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5814.78s)]
*  He's gonna say, we gotta cut this whole conversation. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5815.78s)]
*  No, why would I care? [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5818.78s)]
*  I'd send him money. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5819.78s)]
*  But that is, I think that in the most toxic way possible, we came to a good conclusion, [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5822.78s)]
*  which is you can do the forced diversity, but anytime you force something, you have [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5828.34s)]
*  to acknowledge it in a real way in the world. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5833.46s)]
*  So like back in the day, there was like a black doctor on TV. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5836.7s)]
*  All the characters would be like, it's fucking black. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5839.34s)]
*  If there's a transphobic person. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5841.34s)]
*  Now we're talking. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5843.34s)]
*  Now we're talking. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5845.34s)]
*  First I'm looking at him for the example. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5847.34s)]
*  Back in the day. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5849.34s)]
*  Listen, listen, listen, listen. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5851.34s)]
*  If we had Cosby, right? [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5853.34s)]
*  I was about to say, if women could. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5855.34s)]
*  If women questioned, if women were a little more racist, they would have been a little [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5857.34s)]
*  bit of a. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5861.34s)]
*  What? [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5862.34s)]
*  If women were a little bit more racist with Mr. Huxable, they would have been a little [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5863.34s)]
*  bit of a. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5872.34s)]
*  That's a fact. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5873.34s)]
*  Think about it. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5874.34s)]
*  Think about it. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5875.34s)]
*  If the women were like, ain't no way this black dude's a doctor. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5876.34s)]
*  They would have been. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5882.34s)]
*  They would have been. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5885.34s)]
*  Lack of impulse control. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5886.34s)]
*  That is a symptom. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmET_EErVw8&t=5887.34s)]
