# Algerian Boxer Gender Mystery & Dan Bilzerian Goes Off On Israel
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [August 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA)
*  We're back. We just want vacation. A lot's happened, but nothing will change. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=0.0s)]
*  Everything changes and it all stays the same. The boxer is a man or it's not a man. It doesn't [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  matter. How crazy is it that nobody can say whether it's a man or not? Still, this is how [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=8.08s)]
*  I kind of think she might be a man. If someone was like, yo, Shultz is actually a genetic woman. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  I'm calling the doctor. I'm like, yo, we gotta straighten this shit out. The fact that she's like, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=17.84s)]
*  I'm not showing y'all shit, means she got the Y chromosome, right? But yeah, if you changed into [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  a man, that's different than just being part of the X-True. No, no, I don't think she changed. I [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=26.64s)]
*  genuinely think it is possible that she is intersex, I believe it's called. So basically, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=29.2s)]
*  some people are born with an XY chromosome or they're XXY. So she might not know. That's the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=34.24s)]
*  thing. Nobody knows. Being a woman doesn't mean you have to be pretty. But if we want to make that [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  a law, we could. That should be a law. I don't like that rule. I don't like that rule. Why? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=43.36s)]
*  Because that means back in the day, it might've been a couple of times I had some gay sex. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=46.72s)]
*  Now hold on. We all could've smashed that XXY. You more than me. You've slept with girls from [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=49.92s)]
*  Eastern Europe. Chernobyl p***y having sex. They gotta be super femme, super submissive. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=60.88s)]
*  They gotta be all that. Nobody even says submissive. What's that got to do with anything? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=66.72s)]
*  I gotta add him. That's how you know you're dealing with a dude. That's how you know it's a dude. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  Because no one's ever like, I need a girl that's submissive. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=76.56s)]
*  I didn't get it. I didn't get it. It's got nothing to do with the genetic [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=78.32000000000001s)]
*  conversation. You're saying it's titled and it's started with a bomb. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=82.56s)]
*  You gotta f***ing do it for Williamsburg. That's your only requirement, is submissive. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=84.72s)]
*  He's just saying buzzwords right now. I talked to my boy. My buddy Lucas f***ed a 40-year-old [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=88.4s)]
*  trans woman for the brand new. Why you doing that? Why you calling your brother out, I mean your [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=94.72s)]
*  friend out, just because you kissed a dude, bro? He's trying to get all the heat off of you. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=99.36s)]
*  I'm just saying there's a spectrum. There's a spectrum. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=105.68s)]
*  What did Lucas do the other day? He was talking about Lucas. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=113.84s)]
*  Lucas was a trans woman, a 40-year-old. Every other time he would hide the identity of his [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=121.44000000000001s)]
*  friend, but now he wanted to call him out on his name. Lucas Schmidt from Williamsburg. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  He was funny. For two weeks he didn't want to tell this story. He never saw it back finally. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=132.24s)]
*  He was like, go, go, go, go, Mark. He said it on a podcast. He said it on a pod. I was like, all right, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=137.28s)]
*  don't talk about it. He said it on your pod? No, he said it on his pod. But I was like, all right. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=144.0s)]
*  Lucas who? No, no, my buddy Lucas Zelnick. He's a comic in New York. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  Shout out Lucas. I asked, bro, I asked him. I was like, you were being an older woman? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=152.24s)]
*  You're a freak. What a freak. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=156.0s)]
*  You're a fan. You are a fan. You did not ask him if he ever smashed older women. He was like, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=158.32s)]
*  yes. He answered that question. He goes, yeah, yeah, yeah. Actually, I smashed a 40-year-old [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=165.04s)]
*  trans woman. I was like, all right. No, no, no, no. He wanted to tell you that. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=169.6s)]
*  He did. He wanted to tell you that badly. Why me? Why do you think he wanted to tell me? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  Oh, you'd be more. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=176.64s)]
*  You go. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=183.2s)]
*  Oh, and then what'd you do? Because I know your mind was racing. How did you act normal? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=183.68s)]
*  Locked in. Oh, wow. Does you ask about it? Of course. Did he move that meat to the side? Just [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=193.04000000000002s)]
*  punch gooch? No meat. Brand new vagina. Oh, tennis ball pussies. 2024 model. Yeah. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. That's funny. I don't know if I buy that. She was like hammered at a [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=208.08s)]
*  club. She just walks over and goes, call me a car. Let's go to your place. And he was like, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=212.72s)]
*  all right. And she was like a hot woman, older lady, and chest freckles, the whole deal. And he was [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=216.32s)]
*  like, all right, bet. And then goes to his parents' house and then goes down the balcony of his [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=220.48s)]
*  parents' apartment, then has sex on the balcony. She's like, only backwards, only backwards. And [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=224.16s)]
*  he's like, all right. And he said it felt great. How do you get it wet? It doesn't get wet. Yeah. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=228.32s)]
*  And why only backwards? I don't know. This is what he said. I'm assuming. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=232.8s)]
*  So you don't look at that fucking Adam's ass. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=236.0s)]
*  I think there's a dick still there. She's like, only in the ass. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=239.6s)]
*  A whole doubled up? It might be doubled up. I don't know. But yeah, he said it was great. And [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=241.92s)]
*  then he didn't know she was trans until there was like a magazine that came out about her, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=245.68s)]
*  about like trans models in New York or some shit. Oh, he bragging now. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=249.28s)]
*  But apparently. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=252.72s)]
*  Oh, look at this. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, come on. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=256.0s)]
*  Lucas gets no pussy, bro. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=256.56s)]
*  I fucked a model once. I smashed a model. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=259.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was a prototype of trans. It was the first model. It was the model T of trans. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=263.52s)]
*  Oh, come on. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=267.76s)]
*  So guys are doing it, bro. The young men of New York City, they're getting after it. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=270.64s)]
*  Shout out, Lucas, man. Oh, man. Legend. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=273.6s)]
*  It's a badge of honor now. White dude or black dude? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=277.84s)]
*  White. The trans was Asian. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=280.64s)]
*  He's so relieved. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=282.4s)]
*  Hold on. The trans was Asian? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=284.64s)]
*  Okay, go ahead and ask. Go ahead and ask what I know you're going to ask. Go ahead and ask. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=288.16s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=292.56s)]
*  Ask. Ask. This is where he's going to be hateful and he's going to be like, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=293.6s)]
*  how could you tell the difference? Because he's hateful. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=296.48s)]
*  No, I'm not hateful. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=298.08s)]

*  I don't count it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=302.64s)]
*  It's not that far in the transition. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=303.52s)]

*  You ain't really do that much. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=310.32s)]
*  You didn't fucking trans. That's not full trans. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=311.12s)]
*  It's more of a step than a transition. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=314.08s)]
*  That's a gateway drug. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=316.64s)]
*  It's a pivot. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=317.76s)]
*  No, no, no. That's not full trans. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=318.88s)]
*  Yeah. Black trans, I feel like it's tougher to pull off. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=320.64s)]
*  You know what I mean? I feel like I spot more black trans as like not killing it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=323.03999999999996s)]
*  Especially since our muscles are so more defined. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=327.03999999999996s)]

*  Who's the best black trans? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=334.15999999999997s)]
*  The fact that you can't name it. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=335.91999999999996s)]
*  Name any of the trans. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=337.91999999999996s)]

*  Laverne Cox looked like she used to play middle linebacker in the 80s. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=340.0s)]
*  There's no way. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=344.32s)]
*  Oh, what about? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=344.96s)]

*  Yo, but that's the funniest thing about like the Red Pill community. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=600.88s)]
*  This is like their new thing that they have attached themselves to to seem like pseudo intellectual. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=603.6s)]
*  And which is really annoys me because I prefer us being the only pseudo intellectuals that [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=608.48s)]
*  have strong opinions about things we know nothing about. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=613.28s)]
*  So it's really bothersome when I see all these accounts. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=615.6s)]
*  Just taking our own vibe. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=617.9200000000001s)]

*  They gripped it off our grip. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=619.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, what the fuck is that? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=620.8000000000001s)]

*  Anyway, so yeah, yeah, but that is don't talk shit about the Fed, bro. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=625.68s)]
*  We should look into that. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=632.4799999999999s)]
*  You know who runs the Fed. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=633.12s)]
*  That's true. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=634.8s)]
*  That's true. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=636.0s)]
*  Who runs it? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=636.4799999999999s)]
*  The globalists. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=638.64s)]
*  Yeah, the globalists. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=639.4399999999999s)]

*  My mom says, I swear to God, look, we know having sex with children is wrong. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=848.4s)]

*  So they're flying United, right? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=903.76s)]
*  And the flight is delayed and they can't find their bags. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=905.36s)]
*  So they're stuck in Newark and they can't talk to a person because they get connected [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=908.64s)]

*  And I was like, wait, what? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=920.3199999999999s)]
*  And she's like, look, it shows me a picture of the CEO and like in drag or something. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=922.0s)]
*  I see the picture and switched over to fucking Delta right away. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=925.52s)]
*  My mom is like, go woke up, bro. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=928.7199999999999s)]

*  She's like, can I get my bag or is your CEO going to steal it? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=936.16s)]
*  The person was like, why are you talking? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=940.4s)]
*  She was like, look it up. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=942.0799999999999s)]
*  Shit, I didn't know it was that. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=943.28s)]
*  It's just like barring up the people at the fucking airport. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=944.48s)]
*  And then she came and was like, yeah, I had to tell them. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=947.6800000000001s)]
*  And they're fucking working for a trans. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=949.76s)]

*  Yeah, she was tweeting crazy. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=954.32s)]
*  God, that was insane. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=955.6s)]
*  She was like tweeting and tagging United. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=958.32s)]
*  At United being like, yo, where the fuck's my bag training? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=960.8000000000001s)]
*  How did you come out? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=964.64s)]
*  Regular. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=965.76s)]
*  I know. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=966.08s)]
*  This is why it's a true miracle. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=966.5600000000001s)]
*  This is why you have such a thirst for knowledge. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=968.72s)]
*  You just have to constantly argue with your parents about whatever. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=971.36s)]
*  No question. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=974.72s)]
*  Because they're feeding you this crazy shit. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=975.36s)]
*  You're going to share it with your friends. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=977.04s)]
*  And they're just like, we don't have horns. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=978.48s)]
*  Mark, why are you saying this? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=980.56s)]
*  So then you do that a few times and you're embarrassed. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=982.4s)]
*  So you're like, OK, I got to go look this stuff up. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=984.4s)]
*  And now you look up everything. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=986.16s)]
*  And then you look up and then you got to refute it. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=987.04s)]
*  But it's never on a topic. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=989.68s)]
*  It's always just fact. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=990.72s)]
*  I respond with an argument that's nuanced. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=992.64s)]
*  And then you say a different fact. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=994.72s)]
*  I love that. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=996.3199999999999s)]
*  And then it just goes on just a train. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=996.72s)]
*  And we're using the term fact with quotes. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=998.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1000.24s)]
*  We're like, no, no, no. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1001.7s)]
*  Actually, the facts will be super, super specific. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1002.34s)]
*  And they're technically true. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1004.82s)]
*  So if you Google them, it is true. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1005.62s)]
*  But then she uses that to extrapolate to be like Satan. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1007.3s)]
*  That's how I be doing shit with my girl a little bit, to be honest. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1009.86s)]
*  It's smart. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1012.02s)]
*  That's my technique a little bit. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1012.98s)]
*  Yeah, just hit them with examples after examples. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1014.26s)]
*  They don't know what to do. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1016.82s)]
*  They get frazzled. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1017.54s)]
*  My wife tried to handicap me in arguments. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1018.34s)]
*  What'd she do? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1020.98s)]
*  She said, no more examples. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1021.62s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1026.98s)]
*  I said, what do you mean, no more examples? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1027.6200000000001s)]
*  That's how I win this shit all the time. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1028.66s)]
*  You're trying to get me to argue with no examples? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1030.34s)]
*  Objection. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1032.1799999999998s)]
*  She tried to say no more examples. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1032.74s)]
*  And then she hit me with the, when I tell you how I feel, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1035.3799999999999s)]
*  don't tell me how you feel. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1038.98s)]
*  Acknowledge how I feel. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1041.22s)]
*  And I'd be like, oh, god. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1042.8999999999999s)]
*  Oh, fuck, fuck. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1047.3s)]
*  What did she say? [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1047.9399999999998s)]
*  It was something like, because she'll say what she feels. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1048.5s)]
*  And then I'll immediately say why she shouldn't feel that way. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1051.6999999999998s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1055.86s)]
*  And I didn't even realize you're not supposed to do that. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1056.82s)]
*  Yeah, you're not supposed to. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1059.06s)]
*  I'm just sitting here seeing you feel something dumb. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1060.18s)]

*  Listen, you are burdening yourself with this feeling. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1065.6200000000001s)]
*  You could not feel it if you just listen to me. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1068.5800000000002s)]

*  You have to go play another character to prove that you're an actor. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1758.44s)]
*  Because sometimes you can play something so iconic that we only see you as that character [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1762.44s)]
*  for the rest of your career. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1766.76s)]

*  That was one of the things. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=1778.76s)]

*  The two people that put it on have to be committed and they have to be like super flamboyant. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2128.6s)]

*  A lot of straights. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2144.04s)]
*  I'm like so confused. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2144.76s)]
*  Have you heard of this? [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2146.12s)]
*  So you go into your boy's house and there's some bitch with a martini glass and like short heels. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2146.92s)]

*  I know. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2165.88s)]
*  First thing. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2167.08s)]
*  I'm like, yo, shut the fuck up. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2167.6400000000003s)]

*  Shut the fuck up. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2172.76s)]
*  But how does it go? [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2174.44s)]
*  Like is it quiet the whole time while people try to solve the mystery? [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2175.2400000000002s)]
*  They're like drinking and talking and then like the characters play the roles. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2177.72s)]
*  So like there's a guy and a girl and the guy will come in and he's this big flame point gay [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2181.32s)]
*  and he'll just like scream like a woman and fall to the ground. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2184.6s)]
*  So you're in the middle of this party and now there's like a gay guy flailing on the ground. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2188.2s)]
*  And then the woman now knows her role and she's like, oh no, someone poisoned his drink. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2192.44s)]
*  And then the guy like dies and then he runs out puts on a different outfit. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2197.16s)]
*  So he's in another person that like they're moving the story along and they're playing along. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2201.08s)]
*  This shit might be fire, bro. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2204.68s)]
*  It's not going to Broadway, bro. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2206.36s)]
*  Just pay a couple of dollars. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2207.88s)]
*  This is the thing you support Miles on? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2209.0s)]
*  It might be. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2210.2799999999997s)]
*  This is the thing you support Miles on? [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2210.92s)]
*  He's stabbing the back at every turn and you support him on murder mystery dinner. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2213.0s)]
*  It's a whodunit. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2217.08s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2217.64s)]
*  Go watch a play. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2219.0s)]
*  See some real talent. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2220.6s)]
*  You've done it every time. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2222.12s)]
*  You've done it. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2223.16s)]
*  He said it before. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2223.7999999999997s)]
*  This is some shit that like I imagine you do because you're like afraid of having [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2224.68s)]
*  political conversations, right? [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2231.64s)]
*  Well, everyone there was Jewish, though they were all on the same team. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2234.7599999999998s)]
*  The Palestinian did it. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2237.24s)]
*  So it was very political. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2237.88s)]
*  It was extremely political. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2239.16s)]
*  But like, that was a coincidence. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2240.36s)]
*  If you just, if you're just with your boys, you just talk shit about whatever's happening [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2242.2s)]
*  in the world. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2245.48s)]
*  You talk about the Algerian box. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2246.12s)]
*  So you do like there's no time for murder mystery. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2247.48s)]
*  We got to get hot takes out. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2249.72s)]
*  With limited amount of time, we need hot takes. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2251.16s)]
*  So I imagine this is an environment where it's like, oh, the hot takes is going to make [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2253.24s)]
*  this thing devolve into a problem and people are going to be offended and some is going [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2257.56s)]
*  to say, oh, you're privileged and shut up. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2261.4s)]
*  So we just ignore. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2263.48s)]
*  Maybe it's like the first date where you don't have to just have conversation where it's [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2264.68s)]
*  a little bit like maybe too intimate and this gives you something to do to distract you [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2267.96s)]
*  and then you can warm up to each other in the meantime. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2271.08s)]
*  I get that logic 100%. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2273.32s)]
*  I hate that shit. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2275.24s)]
*  Throwing it and you're socially awkward and you want a reason not to actually have to [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2276.04s)]
*  make conversation with people, but you have a script that you go off and you're just [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2279.72s)]
*  performing the entire time. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2282.7599999999998s)]
*  That's probably what that should like. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2284.36s)]
*  All the performers don't really have to engage and have a regular combo. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2286.6s)]
*  They just have a nice script that they get to stick to and that's their entire night. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2289.96s)]
*  And they can say they have fun. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2293.8s)]
*  This shit is crazy. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2295.16s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a break for a second. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2296.04s)]
*  Listen, maybe some of you have experienced a runner's high. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2297.32s)]
*  You've experienced being in the flow state, if you will. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2300.36s)]
*  There is a way to induce these feelings, these sensations that lock us in and that is with [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2303.48s)]
*  ketone IQ. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2310.28s)]
*  Okay, ketone IQ. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2311.72s)]
*  Fantastic supplement. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2313.48s)]
*  Why is it fantastic? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2315.08s)]
*  Because what it's going to do is going to suppress that hunger that you have in between [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2316.36s)]
*  meals with the snacks, but it's going to give you that energy and focus that you need. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2321.2400000000002s)]
*  You don't want to be out there in the world starving and then trying to actually do things [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2325.88s)]
*  that require your brain. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2330.04s)]
*  Okay, when I am hungry, I'm angry. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2331.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm not making any good decisions. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2334.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm not functioning well in the world. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2336.36s)]
*  That's why the ketone IQ has got my back and it will have yours. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2338.52s)]

*  To Michael Andrews, to Ironman World Champion, Sam Laidlow. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2346.76s)]

*  It is the real deal. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2361.1600000000003s)]

*  Now let's get back to the show. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2381.56s)]
*  All right, guys, we're going to take a break real quick because I got to tell you about [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2382.68s)]
*  8 Sleep. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2385.72s)]
*  At this point, I'm sure you've heard about their buzzworthy sleep technology called the [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2386.2799999999997s)]
*  pod. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2390.2799999999997s)]
*  Here's the cool thing about the pod. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2390.8399999999997s)]
*  If you have a mattress you already like, like I do, you don't have to buy a new mattress. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2392.2799999999997s)]
*  It's just it goes over like a fitted sheet and it automatically can cool down or warm [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2396.8399999999997s)]
*  up each different side of the bed and improve your sleep dramatically. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2401.48s)]
*  Guys, I wake up hot all the time. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2405.32s)]
*  This is a real problem. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2407.48s)]
*  The cool the pod though cools things down so I can sleep through the night uninterrupted [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2408.68s)]
*  because for me, that's the hardest thing. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2412.6s)]
*  If I wake up going back to bed, hardest shit. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2413.8s)]
*  And now the pod has got an upgrade. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2416.36s)]
*  8 Sleep has launched their newest generation of the pod called pod for ultra. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2417.72s)]
*  It cools, heats and now elevates automatically. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2421.56s)]
*  It's also clinically proven to give you up to one more hour of quality sleep every night. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2424.36s)]
*  And now there's an adjustable base that fits between your mattress and bed frame to add [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2429.24s)]

*  Sleeping with these wearables sometimes can be uncomfortable. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2454.6s)]
*  This is integrated into the bed. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2456.6s)]
*  Imperceptible sensors to track your sleep time, HRV, sleep phases, heart rate, all that [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2458.36s)]

*  What game is this? [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2497.24s)]
*  So basically you sit in a circle of people, everyone gets a card and it says you're like [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2497.96s)]
*  a citizen, you're a watch person or you're the killer. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2501.48s)]

*  Get into the fucking game. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2519.96s)]
*  On the ground? [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2522.6s)]
*  You're in India on the ground? [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2523.32s)]
*  You ain't sitting on the ground. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2524.6s)]
*  We play it on couches. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2526.76s)]
*  I was on the couch. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2527.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you play on the couch. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2528.12s)]
*  Do they have couches there? [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2528.84s)]
*  You're just sitting. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2529.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2530.44s)]
*  It's an old Indian folklore game. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2531.08s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2532.92s)]
*  But everyone puts their heads down and then the watch people put their heads up and then [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2533.56s)]
*  they can't talk the whole game or some shit. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2537.7200000000003s)]
*  I can't remember the exact rules, but then basically you got to figure out every round [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2539.7200000000003s)]
*  like who the killer is and the killer kills someone every round. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2543.2400000000002s)]
*  And if the killers win, then they win the whole game. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2545.56s)]
*  And then if the citizens win, they win by telling the people who the killers are. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2547.56s)]
*  But like they could pick the wrong person to be a killer and then they get kicked out. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2551.4s)]
*  Not played once was actually funny. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2554.2s)]
*  This shit is fire. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2555.4s)]

*  Exactly. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2558.84s)]
*  And we're not having to like play roles or you're just talking shit arguing being like, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=2559.4s)]

*  No, 80% of Cardinals are gay. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=3786.86s)]
*  You can't become a Cardinal if you're not gay. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=3788.78s)]
*  Oh yeah, my mom believes that. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=3790.46s)]
*  Then why isn't it 100%? [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=3791.42s)]
*  Well, some of them lie about being gay to become a Cardinal. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=3793.1s)]

*  I mean, more or less. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=3799.58s)]
*  She never said that fact, but she's like, yeah, the whole church is overrun by gays and pedophiles. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=3800.62s)]
*  So then how is she still down with the get-down? [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=3804.62s)]
*  Because she's like, the institution is right, but it's been infiltrated by evildoers and Satan. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=3806.62s)]
*  So she got to get the motherfuckers out of here. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=3810.86s)]

*  My mom would go into Home Depot and leave me in the car for like 25 to 30 minutes just [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=4626.72s)]

*  I've got to be like 12, 13. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=4640.08s)]
*  Okay. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=4641.52s)]

*  It's like having a pee but it's cum. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=4647.68s)]
*  Is that how you really feel about it? [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=4650.16s)]
*  At that time, it was hair trigger, bro. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=4651.92s)]
*  You're 13. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=4653.2s)]

*  I was like pre-release on coming. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=4666.96s)]

*  You know what I mean? [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=4678.400000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=4678.96s)]
*  So you're in the car. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=4679.4400000000005s)]
*  Do you ever calculate, oh, it's kind of weird because my mom is in the car with me or no? [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=4680.72s)]

*  Okay. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=4693.28s)]
*  Okay. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=4693.52s)]
*  Okay. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=4693.68s)]
*  It sounds weird when you save out of the context of being the horniest child alive. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=4694.24s)]
*  But then all of a sudden you pop up with a Guinness book. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=4699.28s)]
*  What did you use to jerk off? [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=4702.56s)]
*  I was the phone with the Google with the boobs. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=4703.76s)]
*  So you cover yourself in the blankets. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=4705.6s)]
*  Yep. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=4707.52s)]
*  You make sure that... [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=4708.0s)]
*  And I'm sleeping for a little and then I wake up and I'm like... [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=4708.8s)]
*  And so you sleep for the first couple hours and she's just driving, having a grand old time. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=4714.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=4718.24s)]
*  And then, yeah, you wake up just in a sweat. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=4718.72s)]
*  In a panty. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=4721.84s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=4723.360000000001s)]
*  And then you pop it open and then at that point his hair triggers. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=4724.0s)]
*  So you're three pumps away at any moment. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=4726.56s)]
*  So it's like... [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=4728.88s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=4729.360000000001s)]

*  It could have been my dad sitting with me. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=4736.96s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=4738.88s)]
*  Like, why are we acting like you've never been horny before? [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE9SK7m9sA&t=4739.76s)]
