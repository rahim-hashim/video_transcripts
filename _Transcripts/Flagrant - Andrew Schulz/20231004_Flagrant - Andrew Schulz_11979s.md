*  Son, I might be in your corner. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1269.3400000000001s)]
*  Do you have anybody in your corner? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1270.9s)]
*  No, you could. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1271.9s)]
*  I'm a dead ass. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1273.66s)]
*  What do you mean, do I know boxing? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1274.66s)]
*  I almost sparred you and you didn't show up. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1275.66s)]
*  You just went right there. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1277.3000000000002s)]
*  That was some fucking Chinese, Armenian shit that you just fucking tried on me. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1279.46s)]
*  We'll talk about it. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1283.66s)]
*  How much are you going to pay to be in the corner? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1284.66s)]
*  Because that's a big opportunity. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1285.66s)]
*  I'd love to sponsor you. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1286.66s)]
*  What brand? [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1287.66s)]
*  Flakrant. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1288.66s)]
*  We're going to do the Flakrant podcast. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1289.66s)]
*  He's going to need it. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1290.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1291.66s)]
*  I'm in your corner. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1292.66s)]
*  I got you. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1293.66s)]
*  I'll be stuffing zins in your lips throughout the whole fight. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1294.66s)]
*  Give me six milligrams more. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1299.0600000000002s)]
*  Dude, whatever you need. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1302.74s)]
*  I'm being dead serious. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1303.74s)]
*  That actually would be kind of fun. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1304.74s)]
*  Yeah, I know, but you can't be saying stupid shit. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1305.74s)]
*  But you're Southpaw and I don't fucking like fighting Southpaws. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1307.74s)]
*  They're annoying as hell. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1310.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1311.74s)]
*  But you're not natural Southpaw, are you? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1312.74s)]
*  Well, I don't want to go too much away. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1313.74s)]
*  You can tell your natural hand. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1316.5s)]
*  Well, Logan doesn't know anything about me, so it's better that way. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1318.22s)]
*  I mean, he could just watch your first MMA fight when you come out Southpaw. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1323.58s)]
*  Yeah, but he doesn't know which one's my power hand. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1326.46s)]
*  Oh, are you one of the Oscar Dale Hoyas? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1328.9399999999998s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1330.82s)]
*  Got you. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1331.82s)]
*  That's because he didn't throw many strikes. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1332.82s)]
*  He kind of just... [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1333.82s)]
*  This is a good point. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1334.82s)]
*  You can go the other way. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1335.82s)]
*  It would be hard to tell. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1336.82s)]
*  Okay, okay, okay, okay. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1337.82s)]
*  Okay, so this is what I heard about you. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1338.82s)]
*  What? [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1340.82s)]
*  We can say some stupid shit. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1341.82s)]
*  Can I just be honest? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1342.82s)]
*  Okay, what? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1343.82s)]
*  Hard puncher. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1344.82s)]
*  Okay, yeah. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1345.82s)]
*  A lot of power and you'll take hits to get in and whatever, but in terms of just out [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1346.82s)]
*  pointing boxing, that's not how you're going to do it. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1354.5s)]
*  That you're going to bang. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1356.82s)]
*  Is that a fair assessment or not? [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1357.82s)]
*  Is that a fair assessment or not? [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1359.82s)]
*  If somebody told me that about you, would you say that they're lying and they're hating [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1360.82s)]
*  or that they were being fair? [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1365.02s)]
*  I think I have more ways of winning than he does. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1366.7s)]
*  Fair, but in terms of you would acknowledge that power is probably your strength in striking. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1369.1s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1373.82s)]
*  Really? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1374.82s)]
*  I think resilience and toughness. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1375.82s)]
*  Well, that's also... [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1376.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1377.82s)]
*  You're going to go inside. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1378.82s)]
*  You're not going to run around. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1379.82s)]
*  I'm not going to take a fucking backwards step. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1380.82s)]
*  See who takes the first backwards step. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1381.82s)]
*  Did you watch Logan against any of the other guys? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1383.3799999999999s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1387.54s)]
*  Shit. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1388.54s)]
*  He has height and reach. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1390.26s)]
*  But he has height and reach. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1391.26s)]
*  And he's gone. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1392.26s)]
*  Yeah, but he throws his punches with pushy punches like that. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1393.26s)]
*  Logan doesn't have technique. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1397.26s)]
*  He loads up and he juices the teeth. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1398.26s)]
*  Yeah, Logan doesn't have technique like Jake does. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1399.26s)]
*  Jake has... [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1401.26s)]
*  Logan is a phenomenal athlete. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1402.26s)]
*  That's no bull shit. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1403.26s)]
*  If you know that he's a bigger guy, he's a better boxer than Jake. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1404.26s)]
*  Come on, everybody knows that. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1407.26s)]
*  Somebody kill you, he still hurts. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1408.26s)]
*  Fuck you. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1409.26s)]
*  Well, you should have fucking just said I was going to win. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1410.26s)]
*  Well, I didn't say you're going to win. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1412.26s)]
*  Well, then I'm going to put you back in that. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1413.26s)]
*  And I'm never going to tap to you ever. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1414.26s)]
*  You did tap. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1415.26s)]
*  We have it on video. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1416.26s)]
*  Tap, tap, tap. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1417.26s)]
*  That wasn't real. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1418.98s)]
*  I said it. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1419.98s)]
*  Tap, tap, tap. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1420.98s)]

*  I'll get you before we go. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1422.98s)]
*  Don't worry. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1423.98s)]
*  He's next too. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1424.98s)]
*  He's far from it. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1425.98s)]
*  You ain't touching Akos. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1426.98s)]
*  Yeah, you can't touch Akos. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1427.98s)]
*  You can't touch Akos. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1428.98s)]

*  You ain't touching Akos is what I'm saying. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1433.3s)]
*  No, you got to hold my pocket before we leave. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1434.3s)]
*  Okay, so... [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1437.3s)]
*  You can hold both our pockets on the way out. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1438.3s)]
*  Okay, so you beat Logan. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1441.3s)]

*  You know how to fight? [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1443.3s)]
*  I mean, I'll do that little rascal thing. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1444.3s)]
*  I'll get you down. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1445.34s)]
*  He's like, we can throw some heads. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1446.34s)]

*  That's a situation that they didn't show the footage. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1480.3799999999999s)]
*  Okay, so what happened was I was at a wedding. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=1481.3799999999999s)]

*  won everybody over [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2000.1s)]
*  What the fuck is the matter with now [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2002.1s)]
*  Is this his long plan? Make the entire world a hate of and then somehow make them love him by being really mean to a girl [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2004.1s)]
*  He's never met [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2010.86s)]
*  At least you accused him of the steroids and you did that I'll give you that because he's he's juiced for sure [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2012.86s)]
*  I just don't believe anyone with a better body than me is [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2018.74s)]
*  To be that tall and have that muscle mass is almost impossible [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2025.58s)]
*  I think it's being lean that's really difficult lean the math and being lean his legs are very skinny and his legs [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2028.54s)]
*  But that's good for you. You're saying no, I'm just saying in general [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2034.38s)]
*  It's a weird body type like just upper body and his legs are still proof of stone [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2036.98s)]
*  You know what's weird too? Yeah, like when you see him, he's big here and then when he turns his work out stick like going this way [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2040.1s)]
*  You know I'm going well, that's this guy. Yeah, we just don't work out good [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2045.3s)]

*  I mean just a little. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2054.5s)]
*  Nope. Nope. I think a little tickle. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2056.5s)]

*  See what's wrong. Nope. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2060.5s)]
*  I won't hurt you. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2062.5s)]
*  Nope. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2064.5s)]

*  Out! Out! Out! [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2068.5s)]
*  Okay that's fine. I'm going to get into it. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2070.5s)]
*  We ain't doing that. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2072.5s)]
*  I'll put you to sleep on the floor here bro. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2074.5s)]
*  I see how much I get paid for that. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2076.5s)]
*  I'm not. I'm getting paid for that one. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2078.5s)]
*  Do black guys go to sleep quicker? [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2080.5s)]
*  They sue faster. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2084.5s)]
*  Really? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2086.5s)]
*  Actually they sue I guess not as opposite faster. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2088.5s)]
*  Slower. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2090.5s)]
*  Like you? [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2092.5s)]
*  You are the opposite. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2094.5s)]
*  Dylan just come on pause and be like this. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2098.5s)]
*  It's just stupid if I said he sues slower. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2100.5s)]
*  No you know what's stupid? [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2102.5s)]
*  Watch the opposite faster. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2104.5s)]
*  I know but I was looking for like a word that's like cooler than slower. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2106.5s)]
*  So the opposite of faster is what you landed on? [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2110.5s)]
*  I love this guy. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2112.5s)]
*  Fuck you guys. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2114.5s)]
*  I've been doing fucking podcasts this 10... [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2116.5s)]
*  Whatever it is I'm fucking tired. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2118.5s)]
*  Fucking doing this shit. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2120.5s)]
*  They're paying me. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2122.5s)]
*  Dzone's paying me to do this. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2124.5s)]
*  Shout out to Dzone. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2126.5s)]
*  Okay so you think you beat him easy. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2128.5s)]

*  Liked? [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2132.5s)]
*  It feels like the internet rallied behind you on this. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2134.5s)]
*  Yeah I like it because I didn't change. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2136.5s)]
*  I never like turn face. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2138.5s)]
*  I'm the same person. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2140.5s)]
*  I think that's why people support me and they don't support Logan [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2142.5s)]
*  because Logan tries to be a good guy when he's a bad guy. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2144.5s)]
*  And you feel like you're... [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2146.5s)]
*  I haven't changed. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2148.5s)]
*  They're still the same shit talking motherfucker. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2150.5s)]
*  No you're not wrong. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2152.5s)]
*  And I think people are like oh he's real. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2154.5s)]
*  Like he'll take it. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2156.5s)]
*  And the best thing about me is I can take the jokes. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2158.5s)]
*  I can take it. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2160.5s)]
*  Logan he doesn't. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2162.5s)]
*  He fucking turns into a shell. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2164.5s)]
*  He'll start suing. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2166.5s)]
*  He'll cut people out of his crew. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2168.5s)]
*  He's a bully. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2170.5s)]
*  He's egotistical. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2172.5s)]
*  Anybody that's not his yes man he makes them sign NDAs and cuts them off. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2174.5s)]
*  Are you breaking my watch right now? [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2176.5s)]
*  No I'm taking off the plastic. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2178.5s)]
*  Son the watch was broken when you bought it. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2180.5s)]
*  I didn't check it out. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2182.5s)]

*  What did you think I was fucking around? [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2192.5s)]
*  Initially I told you exactly what I thought. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2194.5s)]
*  What did you tell Logan? [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2196.5s)]
*  About you? [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2198.5s)]
*  Off camera. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2200.5s)]
*  Did he know that we know each other? [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2202.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2204.5s)]
*  Dude you're our highest viewed podcast. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2206.5s)]
*  I'm like top five. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2208.5s)]
*  Top seven. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2210.5s)]
*  I wasn't as popular as the time. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2212.5s)]
*  I still had good numbers. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2214.5s)]
*  I think you had good numbers at the time. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2216.5s)]
*  You guys were smaller at the time. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2218.5s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2220.5s)]
*  To answer your question I told him that I like you. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2222.5s)]
*  And that I want you to fight. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2224.5s)]

*  Hanging out you're fun and you're very likable. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2230.5s)]
*  And I think that the version that the internet gets only [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2232.5s)]
*  I think people will see this in this interview. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2234.5s)]
*  Yeah of course. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2236.5s)]
*  When you came on it was funny. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2238.5s)]
*  And then obviously some people get upset because you [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2240.5s)]
*  rile people up and you say crazy shit like you could be [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2242.5s)]
*  I could though. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2244.5s)]
*  I hate you. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2246.5s)]
*  I hate you. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2248.5s)]
*  Because here's what happens. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2250.5s)]
*  You take me for a no fighting. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2252.5s)]
*  You told me afterwards you couldn't beat him up. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2254.5s)]
*  I never said that. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2256.5s)]
*  Show me proof. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2258.5s)]
*  That's a fire line. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2260.5s)]
*  I gotta use that. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2262.5s)]
*  You guys are no fighting. It's hard to talk to you guys about fighting. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2264.5s)]
*  Like John Jones sucks. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2266.5s)]
*  What does he suck at? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2268.5s)]
*  Everything bro. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2270.5s)]
*  Look at the light heavyweight division. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2272.5s)]
*  Yeah let's look at it. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2274.5s)]
*  A 43 year old man won the fucking belt. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2276.5s)]
*  What about Alex Pena? [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2278.5s)]
*  He's great. He's moving up from middle weight. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2280.5s)]
*  But now he's in the light heavyweight division. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2282.5s)]
*  And he's going to win the belt. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2284.5s)]
*  And sparring with him. Did he touch you at all? [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2286.5s)]
*  Of course. He's fucking really good. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2288.5s)]
*  And? No shit he's fucking good. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2290.5s)]
*  And did he touch you? [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2292.5s)]
*  Of course he touched me. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2294.5s)]
*  Did you feel the left hand? Of course. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2296.5s)]
*  And? It was good. No bro we had a good spar. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2298.5s)]
*  He got a little dumper right? [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2300.5s)]
*  He got a little dump truck. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2302.5s)]
*  He was the only one that witnessed the sparring. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2304.5s)]
*  The only one person. He won't lie. The bald one. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2306.5s)]
*  You saw it. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2308.5s)]
*  He's shy. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2310.5s)]
*  Do we have a mic? Let's get a mic. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2312.5s)]
*  He's a good shit talker too. If you get him to do lines he's fucking like Chael Sunderland in his prime. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2314.5s)]
*  I never see him on camera. He might shit his pants. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2316.5s)]
*  Does he write for you? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2318.5s)]
*  No I wish. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2320.5s)]
*  I do all my slopes now. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2322.5s)]
*  I swear. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2324.5s)]
*  Actually he might know who. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2326.5s)]
*  Okay so. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2328.5s)]

*  Really? [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2384.5s)]
*  It was a really intense sparring session. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2386.5s)]
*  It was actually one of the hardest sparring sessions I've ever seen him spar at. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2388.5s)]
*  And go in. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2390.5s)]
*  Dillon or Alex? [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2392.5s)]

*  At that high level. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2396.5s)]
*  He did 6, I'm sorry 3 minutes. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2398.5s)]
*  6 rounds. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2400.5s)]
*  At a high pace. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2402.5s)]
*  There was nothing but like. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2404.5s)]
*  He's on trial. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2406.5s)]
*  He's on stand. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2408.5s)]
*  You better get ready. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2410.5s)]
*  Alex was cracking. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2412.5s)]
*  And he didn't take a back step. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2414.5s)]
*  There was no low in the sparring. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2416.5s)]
*  It was high pace. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2418.5s)]
*  Did you guys do jiu jitsu at all? [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2420.5s)]
*  You've seen the videos. That was before. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2422.5s)]
*  But this time we just boxed. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2424.5s)]
*  Did you help him with jiu jitsu at all? [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2426.5s)]
*  To be honest Alex is a great guy. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2428.5s)]
*  I don't have to say help. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2430.5s)]
*  I came and helped I guess. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2432.5s)]
*  I don't want to take credit for his win. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2434.5s)]
*  But I helped him for Yawn. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2436.5s)]
*  And he said he would help me for this. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2438.5s)]
*  Just before him going on vacation. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2440.5s)]
*  I was really cool with him. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2442.5s)]
*  I gotta give him credit. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2444.5s)]
*  It was interesting. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2446.5s)]
*  By the way he saw the sparring. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2448.5s)]
*  And he texted me that day. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2450.5s)]
*  He goes I'm going for a 5 mile run. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2452.5s)]
*  Because how inspiring that sparring session was. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2454.5s)]
*  I went for a 5k run that night. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2456.5s)]
*  I'm like you inspired me today. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2458.5s)]
*  Did you catch him with anything? [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2460.5s)]
*  5k and 5 miles. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2462.5s)]
*  That's a real different thing. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2464.5s)]
*  5k and 5 miles. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2466.5s)]
*  I was trying to make it sound good. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2468.5s)]
*  You fucked it up. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2470.5s)]
*  You gotta learn how to lie. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2472.5s)]
*  You know how you know the difference. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2474.5s)]
*  A real martial artist and these fake guys. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2476.5s)]
*  You don't talk about sparring. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2478.5s)]
*  I don't like to say I caught him or he caught me. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2480.5s)]
*  That's cheesy. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2482.5s)]
*  I go about the Bushido code. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2484.5s)]
*  Were you just implying what happened and you don't say it? [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2486.5s)]
*  No like the code of samurai bro. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2488.5s)]
*  You don't talk about training. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2490.5s)]
*  You don't talk about what? [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2492.5s)]
*  Training. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2494.5s)]
*  I don't talk about that. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2496.5s)]
*  I don't want to be disrespectful to a guy. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2498.5s)]
*  Someone that's my friend and training partner. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2500.5s)]
*  You don't talk about training. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2502.5s)]
*  That's the number one rule of martial arts. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2504.5s)]
*  I hate when people ask me how you do with Connor. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2506.5s)]
*  That's my best friend. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2508.5s)]
*  I'm not going to go talk about training. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2510.5s)]
*  Was that time with Connor when he was just walking through people? [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2512.5s)]
*  This is a friend of yours. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2514.5s)]
*  This is someone that you're helping. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2516.5s)]
*  Do you think that's a good thing? [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2518.5s)]
*  I think it's a good thing. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2520.5s)]
*  I think it's a good thing. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2522.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2524.5s)]
*  If you're watching this going, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2526.5s)]
*  Oh my god, this is what I always dreamed of. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2528.5s)]
*  And one day I have to do it. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2530.5s)]
*  Is it exhilarating? [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2532.5s)]
*  Were you competitive about it? Could you just be happy for your friend? [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2534.5s)]
*  Oh happy. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2536.5s)]
*  It made me happier. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2538.5s)]
*  It's weird to see him succeed and watch. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2540.5s)]
*  I was so happy. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2542.5s)]
*  It gave me the best feeling. Seeing your friend do something so crazy. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2544.5s)]
*  I mean it was unbelievable. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2546.5s)]
*  And being part of it and being like I was living with him at the time. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2548.5s)]
*  And just seeing everything was fucking awesome. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2550.5s)]
*  It inspired me 100%. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2552.5s)]
*  He helped me out more than I helped him. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2554.5s)]
*  He is a fucking G bro. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2556.5s)]
*  When it comes to fighting, it comes to the fucking marketing. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2558.5s)]
*  It comes to the fucking mindset. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2560.5s)]
*  What he's done has not been done before in the sport. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2562.5s)]
*  And who knows if it's done again. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2564.5s)]
*  It's not going to be. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2566.5s)]
*  It might not be. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2568.5s)]
*  Because what he did is he took it from the delta. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2570.5s)]
*  The amount that the sport changed in terms of viewership. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2572.5s)]
*  From when he came on to where it is now. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2574.5s)]
*  He's unbelievable. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2576.5s)]
*  And how do you replicate that again? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2578.5s)]
*  So what I'm trying to understand is [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2580.5s)]
*  You're seeing this happen. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2582.5s)]
*  He strikes me as the guy who is [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2584.5s)]
*  He believes 100% that all these things are achievable. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2586.5s)]
*  And he's saying these things to you [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2588.5s)]
*  Before they're happening. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2590.5s)]
*  I told you the night before the Nate Diaz fight [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2592.5s)]
*  We were living together. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2594.5s)]
*  I was living with him and I was super fucking nervous. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2596.5s)]
*  The night before I'm like [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2598.5s)]
*  It's weird when it's not you. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2600.5s)]
*  Also you have a lot of responsibility in that fight because he gets choked out. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2602.5s)]
*  I'm not saying all of it. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2604.5s)]
*  I don't like to take credit for it. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2606.5s)]
*  I was just a training partner. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2608.5s)]
*  You're brought in for a specific [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2610.5s)]
*  I don't want to say I'm the one that made him. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2612.5s)]
*  I'm just a training partner. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2614.5s)]
*  I'm a good person. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2616.5s)]
*  I'm a training partner. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2618.5s)]
*  He did that himself. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2620.5s)]
*  But if you are in his position you would bring in someone who has a lot of experience in Jiu Jitsu. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2622.5s)]
*  Because of what happened. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2624.5s)]
*  You can say that. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2626.5s)]
*  But the night before I was like [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2628.5s)]
*  I came up to him and we were just talking. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2630.5s)]
*  I was like I'm actually really nervous for tomorrow. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2632.5s)]
*  He goes bro look I'm going to kill him. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2634.5s)]
*  He says something like [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2636.5s)]
*  Stop being nervous. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2638.5s)]
*  I'm going to kill him tomorrow. I'm going to play with him. I promise you. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2640.5s)]
*  And he just walked away. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2642.5s)]
*  He was that serious. He was watching a movie chilling. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2644.5s)]
*  Just unwavering confidence. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2646.5s)]
*  He said that to me. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2648.5s)]
*  I remember we were in the tunnel. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2650.5s)]
*  I don't know if you've ever been back in the UFC. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2652.5s)]
*  When he's about to come out it's like an earthquake is about to happen. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2654.5s)]
*  He's fucking nerve wracking. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2656.5s)]
*  He just turns around and he's like you ready for this? [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2658.5s)]
*  He just fucking pals me. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2660.5s)]
*  I was like fuck now I am. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2662.5s)]
*  It's crazy bro. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2664.5s)]
*  It's insane. The fights that he puts on and the shows. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2666.5s)]
*  You know what's cool? [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2668.5s)]
*  This made me respect Connor a lot. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2670.5s)]
*  Not that I didn't respect him before. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2672.5s)]
*  But he doesn't need [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2674.5s)]
*  to defend you. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2676.5s)]
*  Bro. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2678.5s)]
*  I don't know what your relationship is. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2680.5s)]
*  You guys could talk every single day. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2682.5s)]
*  I don't know. It doesn't matter. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2684.5s)]
*  My point is he doesn't need to defend you. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2686.5s)]
*  And he knows that defending you [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2688.5s)]
*  might put him in a position where he's being criticized. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2690.5s)]
*  But it felt like in that moment he was like [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2692.5s)]
*  that's still my boy. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2694.5s)]
*  And I'm going to fucking hold him down. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2696.5s)]
*  And I don't give a fuck what any of you guys think. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2698.5s)]
*  I'm going to hold him down. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2700.5s)]
*  And I saw that and as a man [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2702.5s)]
*  I was like I would want a friend of mine [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2704.5s)]
*  to be like that. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2706.5s)]
*  Well you have something to lose by defending someone [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2708.5s)]
*  and you're still fucking doing it. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2710.5s)]
*  I think at the end of the day I always had his back [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2712.5s)]
*  throughout everything in his whole life. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2714.5s)]
*  He just seems like a dude who would be loyal. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2716.5s)]
*  And he knows my loyalty. He wouldn't do that for anybody. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2718.5s)]
*  He's very very loyal to people who are loyal to him. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2720.5s)]
*  And I think he sees that. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2722.5s)]
*  I was always there for him and I never [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2724.5s)]
*  said one bad word about him. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2726.5s)]
*  A lot of his friends turned on him. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2728.5s)]
*  And I always had his back. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2730.5s)]
*  I'll never say a bad word about him. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2732.5s)]
*  It doesn't matter if we never talked again and we had a fall out. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2734.5s)]
*  It's just not who I am. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2736.5s)]
*  So I think that he sees his loyalty and he always [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2738.5s)]
*  respects the loyalty. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2740.5s)]
*  I think also what happens is as you get [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2742.5s)]
*  as you go higher and higher in any business [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2744.5s)]
*  it becomes isolating. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2746.5s)]
*  Some of my friends now turn on me. It's crazy. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2748.5s)]
*  Wait really? What do you mean? [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2750.5s)]
*  Now that we don't talk they're trying to [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2752.5s)]
*  get clout off me by sending pictures. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2754.5s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2756.5s)]
*  You realize when you start getting more popular [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2758.5s)]
*  who was real and who's not real. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2760.5s)]
*  What about your cute ass little brother? [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2762.5s)]
*  He's good. He's a little... [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2764.5s)]
*  We were talking about this before the pod started. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2766.5s)]
*  What a dying piece. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2768.5s)]
*  What is he doing right now? Is he dancing somewhere? [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2770.5s)]
*  I want to watch him dance. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2772.5s)]
*  I'll send you some videos. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2774.5s)]
*  That's a video. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2776.5s)]
*  He was so funny after this. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2778.5s)]
*  He was so uncomfortable after that. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2780.5s)]
*  I don't look like Ply Lake. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2782.5s)]
*  He was so upset after that. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2784.5s)]
*  But no, he throws too. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2786.5s)]
*  I got into that street fight. He was the first one to throw a punch. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2788.5s)]
*  Oh really? Wait does he fight as well? [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2790.5s)]
*  No, he just fucking... He has my back. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2792.5s)]
*  When I got arrested he knocked out one of the bouncers. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2794.5s)]
*  He was in jail with me. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2796.5s)]
*  He just started throwing punches at anybody. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2798.5s)]
*  So he's one of those. He'll just go to war for me. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2800.5s)]
*  It's just you two or you have other siblings? [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2802.5s)]
*  I have a sister too. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2804.5s)]
*  Oh really? And she's been out of this kind of conversation? [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2806.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2808.5s)]
*  I'm not going to give something lowly to people who come out there. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2810.5s)]
*  Do you think about... No, I'm being honest. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2812.5s)]
*  Do you think about that kind of stuff because if you're going to family, now you're going... [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2814.5s)]
*  That's not family though. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2816.5s)]
*  That's different. Like he said, mom, sister, fiance is different. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2818.5s)]
*  See? [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2820.5s)]
*  I never said anything about his mom. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2822.5s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2824.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2826.5s)]
*  Very nice lady. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2828.5s)]
*  Wow, so because you're being married into... [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2830.5s)]
*  Well, she's not even wife yet, I guess. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2832.5s)]
*  But would it make a difference? [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2834.5s)]
*  She's a public figure too. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2836.5s)]
*  So if the person is not a public figure... [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2838.5s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, I don't have rules to this shit. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2840.5s)]
*  But I think it's just different going... [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2842.5s)]
*  We have rules. Not rules rules, but I think one of the things like... [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2844.5s)]
*  I don't like going at people's wives. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2846.5s)]
*  Especially if they're not in the public. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2848.5s)]
*  If Oprah is married to Tom Brady, [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2850.5s)]
*  they're both unique public figures. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2852.5s)]
*  So you felt like since she is a public figure, [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2854.5s)]
*  she can be commented on. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2856.5s)]
*  Yeah. And there was just so much honor, bro. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2858.5s)]
*  There's stuff that I have that... [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2860.5s)]
*  What is the nuclear thing? [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2862.5s)]
*  I'm in the lawsuits, bro. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2864.5s)]
*  Oh, so you can't even... [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2866.5s)]
*  I have a restraining order. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2868.5s)]
*  I could just show you a picture or something and then pretend that... [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2870.5s)]
*  You could do that, but don't do that. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2872.5s)]
*  No, I can't. I have a restraining order. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2874.5s)]
*  So that's the lawsuit. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2876.5s)]
*  And then defamation too. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2878.5s)]
*  I don't understand why... [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2880.5s)]
*  Because I said she had HIV, which I don't understand why you could sue for that, but the freedom of speech. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2882.5s)]
*  Yeah, but defamation can be applied to everything. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2886.5s)]
*  And also he said my mom's a prostitute, so she could sue him for defamation. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2888.5s)]
*  So it's like, what do you want to get to a suit of battle? [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2890.5s)]
*  Why would he say that? [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2892.5s)]
*  Because he had nothing else to say because I was attacking his fiance. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2894.5s)]
*  He just was looking to... [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2896.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2898.5s)]
*  I know he said something about a hot tub. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2900.5s)]
*  I was like, who's... I don't know who the fuck is in the hot tub. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2902.5s)]
*  My stepdad's name is Tony. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2904.5s)]
*  I don't know if he was talking about that. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2906.5s)]
*  I don't know who the fuck he was talking about. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2908.5s)]
*  I think he was just trying to reach or something. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2910.5s)]
*  Because Logan is supposed to be really good at this promoting shit, but he's not. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2912.5s)]
*  Let's be honest. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2914.5s)]
*  He didn't do anything for this fight. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2916.5s)]
*  Well, he made a couple of stupid jokes that you wrote for him that were terrible. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2918.5s)]
*  The jokes were good. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2920.5s)]
*  Terrible. I text you right away. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2922.5s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2924.5s)]
*  The comedian that gives my shit is way better than yours. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2926.5s)]
*  No, no. When? [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2928.5s)]
*  The fucking Count Dracula and then the fucking Dunkin' Donuts. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2930.5s)]
*  That hurt you, bro. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2932.5s)]
*  Dillon Donuts, bro? You got better than that? [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2934.5s)]
*  Well, no, I didn't do that one. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2936.5s)]
*  That's the way they want to have you back on Netflix, bro. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2938.5s)]
*  You got shitty ass jokes like that, bro. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2940.5s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2942.5s)]
*  I'm sorry, Netflix. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2944.5s)]
*  Does any part of you feel bad for Nina at all? [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2946.5s)]
*  That she's involved in this? [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2948.5s)]
*  In the beginning. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2950.5s)]
*  But now that she's sitting with me now, fuck her. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2952.5s)]
*  Fuck that bitch. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2954.5s)]
*  In the beginning, you felt. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2956.5s)]
*  Bro, it's all public. That's her fault. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2958.5s)]
*  She's trying to say defamation, all this shit. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2960.5s)]
*  You shouldn't have done it then. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2962.5s)]
*  Just because he did gay porn 10 years ago and I bring it back up and now he gets mad because I'm bringing up his past. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2964.5s)]
*  Fuck that. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2966.5s)]
*  That's her. She did that all herself. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2968.5s)]
*  All those videos, everything is her. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2970.5s)]
*  All those pictures, all the guys that you fuck. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2972.5s)]
*  What about the stuff that she said was private? [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2974.5s)]
*  That's not private, bro. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2976.5s)]
*  Do you think I'm smart enough to hack a fucking iPad 2014? [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2978.5s)]
*  No, no, it's not about private. It's about creating a narrative around it. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2980.5s)]
*  Like, for example, we talk on a podcast. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2982.5s)]
*  She acts like she's Andrea Nalema and I'm affecting her career, bro. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2984.5s)]
*  She had no career. Look at the Google Trends. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2986.5s)]
*  I'm not saying that. What I'm saying is- [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2988.5s)]
*  I made her more popular than she's ever been. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2990.5s)]
*  You're being defensive when you don't have to. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2992.5s)]
*  No, because your friends are from iCode or some stupid shit. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2994.5s)]
*  No, I don't know her at all. At all. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2996.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=2998.5s)]
*  Your dick is hard, bro. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3000.5s)]
*  It's always hard. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3002.5s)]
*  What the fuck is that? [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3004.5s)]
*  I don't know her at all. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3006.5s)]
*  I got heart. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3008.5s)]
*  So, no, and there's nothing for you to be defensive here. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3010.5s)]
*  What we're saying is like, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3012.5s)]
*  there was a moment where we were like, [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3014.5s)]
*  the narrative, the creating of the narrative, [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3016.5s)]
*  we talk on a podcast every single week for hours. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3018.5s)]
*  You could create a narrative around anything. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3020.5s)]
*  You could create a narrative that Mark Ruhl likes to eat. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3022.5s)]
*  Yeah, but I only posted public pictures. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3024.5s)]
*  And I didn't put any captions in the beginning [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3026.5s)]
*  and the public took it how they took it. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3028.5s)]
*  Let's be real. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3030.5s)]
*  I didn't say anything. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3032.5s)]
*  Come on, son. Yeah. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3034.5s)]
*  She dated all those guys. How is that not my fault? [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3036.5s)]
*  So what about the ones where it's just like a bunch of guys [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3038.5s)]
*  just lined up ready to [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3040.5s)]
*  run a trend and shit like that? That's funny. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3042.5s)]
*  Yeah, but you know what you're implying. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3044.5s)]
*  You know what the message is. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3046.5s)]
*  The turkey one got me, bro. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3048.5s)]
*  I didn't know it was on the honeymoon. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3050.5s)]
*  The one where it's the turkey looking out. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3052.5s)]
*  That was crazy. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3054.5s)]
*  But Logan even said that was funny. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3056.5s)]
*  It has some good ones in there. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3058.5s)]
*  But listen, you have a Jiu-Jitsu guy fighting [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3060.5s)]
*  a guy that's 0 and 3. What are you going to sell the fight on? [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3062.5s)]
*  Us on fucking arm boxing? [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3064.5s)]
*  Oh, there's no question you sold the fight. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3066.5s)]
*  I know, so yeah, I'm going to sell a Jiu-Jitsu guy against a guy [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3068.5s)]
*  that's never boxed. Oh yeah, can't wait for me to hit my left of range. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3070.5s)]
*  What's the benefit of selling the fight for you? [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3072.5s)]
*  If you're not getting a piece. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3074.5s)]
*  I definitely got more popular. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3076.5s)]
*  That's true. I'm an Al May list. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3078.5s)]
*  That's... [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3080.5s)]
*  Wait a minute, hold on. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3084.5s)]
*  Hold on, let's make this over. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3086.5s)]
*  I don't know if you made an A in your life, Dylan. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3088.5s)]
*  You and these little fucking zingers in the corner. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3090.5s)]
*  I'm going to get him to it. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3092.5s)]
*  And it's not fair. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3094.5s)]
*  I can't really see him. He keeps throwing these little jokes [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3096.5s)]
*  and then he goes back to his corner. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3098.5s)]
*  I'm defenseless against it. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3100.5s)]
*  I keep forgetting he's there. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3102.5s)]
*  And then he just comes up with his little zingers, bro. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3104.5s)]
*  That's going to be that jam when Logan's coming. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3106.5s)]
*  I'm trying to think right now, [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3108.5s)]
*  how many currently, [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3110.5s)]
*  how many fighters... [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3112.5s)]
*  He already dropped the fight. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3114.5s)]
*  I'm definitely... [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3116.5s)]
*  Fighters A-list. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3118.5s)]
*  I'm just talking about A-list. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3120.5s)]
*  How many fighters are ubiquitous? [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3122.5s)]
*  He has a form. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3124.5s)]
*  He means sexy. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3126.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3128.5s)]
*  Ubiquitous. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3130.5s)]
*  You heard that before. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3132.5s)]
*  You're one of those ubiquitous fighters. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3134.5s)]
*  How many fighters are just world-renowned? [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3136.5s)]
*  How many fighters everybody knows right now? [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3140.5s)]
*  Maybe not older people, but... [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3142.5s)]
*  If you go on the street, I bet you people know me before any of these guys. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3144.5s)]
*  I would agree. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3146.5s)]
*  I would say that... [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3148.5s)]
*  You can get him back on camera. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3150.5s)]
*  Every place we go, at least 100 pictures, everywhere. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3152.5s)]
*  I'm making your argument. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3154.5s)]
*  I'm saying you actually... [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3156.5s)]
*  I've been defenseless. I've been on fucking every show. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3158.5s)]
*  I know, but you don't have to hear. You see what I'm saying? [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3160.5s)]
*  Yes, I hear what you're saying, and this is no shade, [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3162.5s)]
*  I've been a fighter for a really long time. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3164.5s)]
*  And more people know you for trolling. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3166.5s)]
*  But I'm still known though. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3168.5s)]
*  I don't even think you can be considered a fighter right now. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3170.5s)]
*  Don't even say that. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3172.5s)]
*  You're more of a troller. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3174.5s)]
*  No, I'm not. I had two knee injuries. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3176.5s)]
*  Nick Chubb's injury was not as bad as mine. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3178.5s)]
*  I had two, so you can't say that, oh, he's not a fighter. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3180.5s)]
*  I know you could fight. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3182.5s)]
*  I'm just saying more people know you because of the trolling you fight. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3184.5s)]
*  You can't say that's like if Tom Brady retires, [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3186.5s)]
*  and now he's still a football player. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3188.5s)]
*  But everybody remembers what he did in football. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3190.5s)]
*  It's been so long for you. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3192.5s)]
*  People remember my two fights in Bellator every day. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3194.5s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3196.5s)]
*  Do you feel that? [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3198.5s)]
*  He said every day got me good. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3202.5s)]
*  Every day. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3204.5s)]
*  Every day was good. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3206.5s)]
*  It's all good. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3208.5s)]
*  People play it every day. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3210.5s)]
*  I have to take the biggest piss. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3212.5s)]
*  I don't know if I'm allowed to leave. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3214.5s)]
*  All right, guys, we're going to take a break for a second. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3216.5s)]
*  Let's face it, okay, bad habits are hard to kick. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3218.5s)]
*  We all know this, okay? [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3220.5s)]
*  Plenty of bad things that we've picked up. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3222.5s)]
*  We just cannot let go of. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3224.5s)]
*  It's awful. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3226.5s)]
*  How are you going to change that? [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3228.5s)]
*  How are you going to change your life? [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3230.5s)]
*  Well, our sponsor, Fume, is here to help you kick one of the hardest habits of all time. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3232.5s)]

*  and behavioral science to help you [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3238.5s)]
*  trade out your negative habit for a [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3240.5s)]
*  positive one. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3242.5s)]

*  in this thing. It's just a device [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3248.5s)]
*  that is designed to transform your negative habits [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3250.5s)]
*  into a habit [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3252.5s)]
*  that will not affect you at all. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3254.5s)]

*  filled with potentially harmful chemicals like a vape, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3258.5s)]
*  Fume uses cores infused with plants [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3260.5s)]
*  like peppermint, cinnamon, for delicious [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3262.5s)]

*  Fume has got your back. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3284.5s)]
*  The easiest way to stop a bad habit [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3286.5s)]

*  I need a... [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3509.5s)]
*  I need a fucking opponent. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3511.5s)]
*  Come on, come on, come on. Do it again. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3513.5s)]
*  I'll put the hands up. What is the combo? [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3515.5s)]
*  Get ready, here we go. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3517.5s)]
*  We're back on. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3519.5s)]
*  Okay, so to cover the distance, he had his hands up. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3521.5s)]
*  So if I would just come in, he's just gonna hit me. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3523.5s)]
*  So I threw a... I think I threw a... [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3525.5s)]
*  Was that uppercut? [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3527.5s)]
*  What is that? [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3529.5s)]
*  It's uppercut. Watch. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3531.5s)]
*  So I think I threw an uppercut. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3533.5s)]
*  So he keeps his hands up, so you gotta keep your hands up. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3535.5s)]
*  And then I went body, body. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3537.5s)]
*  That was it. And everybody was going crazy. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3539.5s)]
*  But if I lead sometimes, if it was just a jab, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3541.5s)]
*  we gotta come in with some other stuff. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3543.5s)]
*  So I came uppercut, uppercut, body, body. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3545.5s)]

*  Why not? [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3867.5s)]
*  Come get it back. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3869.5s)]
*  Give me the phone. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3871.5s)]
*  Why does Logan float trying to fight you? [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3873.5s)]
*  I think that's a bad idea. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3875.5s)]
*  The bag was bigger in Bellator to fight an MMA in boxing. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3877.5s)]
*  You were asking who we want to win. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3881.5s)]
*  Can I be honest with you? [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3883.5s)]
*  When it comes to the fights, [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3885.5s)]
*  I literally have so much respect for people that go in the ring. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3887.5s)]
*  I'm a Jiu Jitsu guy that's boxing. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3891.5s)]
*  I know. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3893.5s)]
*  I'm not saying I don't have respect. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3895.5s)]
*  I want you to make all the money. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3897.5s)]
*  Not you. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3899.5s)]
*  I want everyone to make the money. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3901.5s)]
*  I promote this whole thing more than anyone else. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3903.5s)]
*  I don't understand why you don't get a piece. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3905.5s)]
*  At the time, I pulled out a KSI fight. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3907.5s)]
*  Either you take this or you don't take this. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3909.5s)]
*  Logan was like, either you do it or you don't do it. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3911.5s)]
*  I want to fight him so bad I was like, fuck it. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3913.5s)]
*  What happened with the KSI fight? [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3915.5s)]
*  I don't want to talk about that. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3917.5s)]
*  He's a pussy. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3919.5s)]
*  Why don't you want to talk about it? [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3921.5s)]
*  Is it a legal thing? [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3923.5s)]
*  No, it's personal shit I was going through. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3925.5s)]
*  We can talk about it off camera. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3927.5s)]
*  The guy you get into the skirmish with at that fight, [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3929.5s)]
*  do you still want something with him? [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3933.5s)]
*  What's the guy's name? [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3935.5s)]
*  He's like, give him credit. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3937.5s)]
*  I don't want to say his name. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3939.5s)]
*  He's a loser. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3941.5s)]
*  I didn't want to fight him. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3943.5s)]
*  He was a terrible MMA guy. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3945.5s)]
*  He was fighting MMA. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3947.5s)]
*  He was 0-5 in Bellator or some shit. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3949.5s)]
*  Then he went to that shit. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3951.5s)]
*  He's doing decent because he's fighting a bunch of influencers. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3953.5s)]
*  I'm just saying, you guys have this... [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3955.5s)]
*  He sucker punched me. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3957.5s)]
*  You know what's funny? [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3959.5s)]
*  I knew he was going to do that. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3961.5s)]
*  I was avoiding him. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3963.5s)]
*  He punched me in the back of the head. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3965.5s)]
*  I didn't want to give him the clock. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3967.5s)]
*  He got 400k off that. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3969.5s)]
*  I saw him. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3971.5s)]
*  I don't know if it was in the back of your head. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3973.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3975.5s)]
*  You know what it was? [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3977.5s)]
*  I was like, bro, I don't want to... [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3979.5s)]
*  I know it's just giving him credit. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3981.5s)]
*  All these guys want to do is just try to get something on me. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3983.5s)]
*  I was pissed off because I told Misfits this was going to happen. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3985.5s)]
*  They were running a shit show at that time. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3987.5s)]
*  I was pissed off. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3989.5s)]
*  I was like, bro, you're giving this kid clout for nothing. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3991.5s)]
*  I was just so mad. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3993.5s)]
*  Then I went and knocked out the other two guys. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3995.5s)]
*  It was just whatever. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3997.5s)]
*  What's the end goal? UFC champion. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=3999.5s)]
*  It's UFC. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4001.5s)]
*  Bells are bought by PFL now. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4003.5s)]
*  PFL is owned by the Saudi... [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4005.5s)]
*  I don't know who owns PFL, but they have some crazy money because they ain't making no money. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4007.5s)]
*  I don't know how the hell they're doing it. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4011.5s)]
*  Do you have to get bought out of PFL? [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4013.5s)]
*  I don't know how that works yet, or they cut me. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4015.5s)]
*  They cut you and then you hopefully get a UFC contract. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4017.5s)]
*  Then you want to get the belt at what? [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4019.5s)]
*  I'm boy's with Dana. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4021.5s)]
*  170. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4023.5s)]
*  You're not a big 170. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4025.5s)]
*  I feel like... [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4027.5s)]
*  I'm bigger than most guys. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4029.5s)]
*  You're six foot? [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4031.5s)]
*  I can probably make 55. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4033.5s)]
*  That's the thing I was wondering. Is it worth to make 55? [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4035.5s)]
*  Someone said my head is too big for 55, but I don't know. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4037.5s)]
*  That's what they told me. I have a big head. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4039.5s)]
*  But at 55... [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4041.5s)]
*  I'm just saying, at 55 and you grab a guy... [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4043.5s)]
*  What are they going to do at 55? [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4045.5s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4047.5s)]
*  That's why I can't wait. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4049.5s)]
*  That's why I'm so stupid with this box. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4051.5s)]
*  No, but like you said earlier... [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4053.5s)]
*  So now I'm understanding it more. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4055.5s)]
*  You don't get a piece of this fight you're promoting, but your stock has risen. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4057.5s)]
*  So it's worth the money that you're making around the fight and then future career stuff. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4059.5s)]
*  And potentially trying to get into UFC. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4063.5s)]
*  And if you beat Logan, right? [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4065.5s)]
*  Not if. When? [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4067.5s)]
*  We talked about Connor projecting. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4069.5s)]
*  Manifesting. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4071.5s)]
*  I believe that. I believe in manifesting. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4073.5s)]
*  So when you beat Logan, do you do another one of these fights? [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4075.5s)]
*  There's no point in doing MMA. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4079.5s)]
*  Jake and KSR are fighting for my rights if I win. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4081.5s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4083.5s)]
*  Well, they want the upside on what happened. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4085.5s)]
*  They want the upside. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4087.5s)]
*  KSI doesn't want me to go to Jake and Jake doesn't want me to go to KSI. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4089.5s)]
*  Bro, so Jake is investing... [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4091.5s)]
*  Hold on, hold on, hold on. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4093.5s)]
*  Jake is an easier fighter who is a better fighter. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4095.5s)]
*  Jake is investing in his brother losing? [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4097.5s)]
*  It's like, yeah. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4101.5s)]
*  You gotta think, Jake doesn't have any other opponents. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4103.5s)]
*  Like that aren't MMA guys. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4105.5s)]
*  There's no more retired guys for him. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4107.5s)]
*  That's right. He has KSI. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4109.5s)]
*  And Tommy again. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4111.5s)]
*  Nobody wants to see the Tommy fight again. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4113.5s)]
*  Like that match that knocked out Logan. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4115.5s)]
*  Wow. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4117.5s)]
*  We're not saying that. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4119.5s)]
*  I love Jake, but we're not arguing. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4121.5s)]
*  Come on, dude. Canelo is not... [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4123.5s)]
*  It's a different game. And Jake knows it's a different game. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4125.5s)]
*  I know. Jake just says things. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4127.5s)]
*  When I say I'm going to beat John Jones, I mean it. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4129.5s)]
*  He's just so serious. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4131.5s)]
*  Why are you laughing like that? [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4133.5s)]
*  Bro, we just dominated you. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4135.5s)]
*  I love the bullshit. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4137.5s)]
*  We just dominated you 4-1. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4139.5s)]
*  4-1, we just dominated you, bro. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4141.5s)]
*  We could beat John Jones. I won that. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4143.5s)]
*  Do you think we could beat John Jones? [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4145.5s)]
*  After what we just did to you, we let you up. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4147.5s)]
*  We let you up. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4149.5s)]
*  We didn't choke you out. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4151.5s)]
*  We'll move the table and all of us will go one. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4153.5s)]
*  I could've had sex with you if I wanted. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4155.5s)]
*  I was in the fucking bottom position. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4157.5s)]
*  My dick was up. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4159.5s)]
*  If you were to get down, you would have to go under. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4161.5s)]
*  He definitely got that Pete Davidson dick too. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4165.5s)]
*  Like that long skinny one. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4167.5s)]
*  He looks just like Pete Davidson. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4169.5s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4171.5s)]
*  That's a vivid description. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4173.5s)]
*  No, they say it girls say it. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4175.5s)]
*  Don't confirm over here. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4177.5s)]
*  You're pumping me in the back. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4179.5s)]
*  You did say that. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4181.5s)]
*  I got the curve. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4183.5s)]
*  Every girl says that about Pete Davidson. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4185.5s)]
*  How many girls? I've never heard that shit. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4187.5s)]
*  But why are you talking to girls? [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4189.5s)]
*  I heard it's big. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4191.5s)]
*  I know, but tall skinny guys, they usually got like the... [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4193.5s)]
*  Are you trying to say I have a big dick? [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4195.5s)]
*  No, you have skinny. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4197.5s)]
*  What does yours look like? [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4199.5s)]
*  Like a missile to be honest. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4201.5s)]
*  Like a missile. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4203.5s)]
*  Like the ones that the drones shoot out of their thing? [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4205.5s)]
*  Like a little mini? [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4207.5s)]
*  Like an 8.5 missile. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4209.5s)]
*  Probably bigger than your head. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4211.5s)]
*  An 8.5-inch missile. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4213.5s)]
*  It's not out 9 with a curve. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4219.5s)]
*  He's not circumcised you can tell. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4221.5s)]
*  No, he is. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4223.5s)]
*  Why would you say that? [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4225.5s)]
*  One of my best friends was Indian. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4227.5s)]
*  He was circumcised. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4229.5s)]
*  Why is he an ex-best friend? [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4231.5s)]
*  We're not best friends no more. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4233.5s)]
*  Like physically? [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4235.5s)]
*  Why are you guys not best friends? [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4237.5s)]
*  Some people, they can talk about this more. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4239.5s)]
*  Some people leave you when... [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4241.5s)]
*  When you need them the most. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4243.5s)]
*  We were there for you when you needed us. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4245.5s)]
*  You rolled up absolutely shit-faced. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4247.5s)]
*  You didn't bring me to rehab. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4249.5s)]
*  You made me drive the car home. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4251.5s)]
*  Honestly, you were funny on the pot. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4253.5s)]
*  He's like, here's the keys. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4255.5s)]
*  Let me drive home. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4257.5s)]
*  Wait, were you really that bad when you came? [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4259.5s)]
*  Bro. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4261.5s)]
*  I didn't know. I didn't know he was partying. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4263.5s)]
*  You have to understand, it was Miami. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4265.5s)]
*  So we're assuming that you're just having fun. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4267.5s)]
*  I didn't know that you were... [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4269.5s)]
*  Now I know that you were going through something in your life. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4271.5s)]
*  I mean, that was the beginning of it. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4273.5s)]
*  How long was the period like that? [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4275.5s)]
*  Since my knee injury. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4277.5s)]
*  Really? [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4279.5s)]
*  2019 until 2022. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4281.5s)]
*  I hate to talk, I don't want this to be a therapy session. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4283.5s)]
*  No, you had a great podcast with your boy. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4285.5s)]
*  What is your name, man? John. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4287.5s)]
*  Which you guys should go watch on your channel. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4289.5s)]
*  That I watch. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4291.5s)]
*  No, it's yours. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4293.5s)]
*  It's uploaded on his too. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4295.5s)]
*  Really? [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4297.5s)]
*  Oh, so I guess I watched some clips that were on yours. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4299.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4301.5s)]
*  So go watch it. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4303.5s)]
*  It's a very organic, just two friends talking. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4305.5s)]
*  You can tell you guys are friends. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4307.5s)]
*  You're not defensive in the least. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4309.5s)]
*  So I actually don't have many friends. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4311.5s)]
*  There's like two, three guys and I actually met him [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4313.5s)]
*  not that long ago and he's just like... [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4315.5s)]
*  Why don't you have friends? [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4317.5s)]
*  I don't trust him, but everybody turns on me. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4319.5s)]
*  Are you only friends with... [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4321.5s)]
*  You are... [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4323.5s)]
*  Something's off about that. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4325.5s)]
*  Why are you losing so many friends? [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4327.5s)]
*  But there's friends and then there's friends. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4329.5s)]
*  We all know this. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4331.5s)]
*  You're saying you have a lot of people you would club with [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4333.5s)]
*  and then there's two people that you're like homies. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4335.5s)]
*  But why not build that group? [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4337.5s)]
*  I mean, I'm not talking about you, which is so fucking intimate. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4339.5s)]
*  And I'm not talking about the touching. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4341.5s)]
*  You're spending a lot of time with people. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4343.5s)]
*  And your life is in their hands and their life is in your hands. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4345.5s)]
*  Maybe it's my mind. I don't trust people. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4347.5s)]
*  What's the trust thing? [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4349.5s)]
*  I don't know. It's just something about me, maybe. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4351.5s)]
*  Has something happened? [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4353.5s)]
*  I got fucked over a lot by friends. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4355.5s)]
*  Close friends. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4357.5s)]
*  You know what it is, when you go through bad times, you see who's really there for you. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4359.5s)]
*  I don't want friends that are there when the good times are there. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4361.5s)]
*  I want them when they're both. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4363.5s)]
*  So you're still holding on to that a little bit. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4365.5s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't know. It's just tough to talk about. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4367.5s)]
*  On your guy's pod, you had an interesting thing about how [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4369.5s)]
*  what you see now [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4371.5s)]
*  a lot of in jujitsu is [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4373.5s)]
*  this trash talk and building up fights. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4375.5s)]
*  Because of me. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4377.5s)]
*  I started this. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4379.5s)]
*  So I didn't know that. Honestly, I'm a casual when it comes to jujitsu. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4381.5s)]
*  But you're saying even earlier [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4383.5s)]
*  in your early jujitsu days. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4385.5s)]
*  And I used to get suspended from Marcellos for doing this. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4387.5s)]
*  So Marcello Garcia [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4389.5s)]
*  suspended me first. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4391.5s)]
*  But he was your jujitsu coach. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4393.5s)]
*  He was an unbelievably respected person in jujitsu. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4395.5s)]
*  From what I hear [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4397.5s)]
*  from a bunch of different people. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4399.5s)]
*  Amazing. And also like [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4401.5s)]
*  a smaller guy. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4403.5s)]
*  But his technique. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4405.5s)]
*  So this tiny dude [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4407.5s)]
*  can go dominate dude on technique. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4409.5s)]
*  Not power. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4411.5s)]
*  Just play it here. I was going to put a highlight. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4413.5s)]
*  How's this work though? [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4415.5s)]
*  Is this like you guys cut this or is this like, oh, this is long? [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4417.5s)]
*  We just hang it. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4419.5s)]
*  We just hang it. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4421.5s)]
*  You guys want to draw? Take some shots. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4423.5s)]
*  Take whatever you want. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4425.5s)]
*  Is that why you got banned from the gym? [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4427.5s)]
*  Because of the shit talking? [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4429.5s)]
*  In the beginning I used to get suspended. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4431.5s)]
*  But I was who I was still back then. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4433.5s)]
*  And then the one that got me kicked out of the gym was just [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4435.5s)]
*  me talking to him with shit. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4437.5s)]
*  He didn't believe in the whole shit talking thing. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4439.5s)]
*  So jujitsu culturally [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4441.5s)]
*  can you explain to people [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4443.5s)]
*  where it's coming from? [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4445.5s)]
*  It's martial arts. Respect your opponent. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4447.5s)]
*  And he's doing WWE stuff. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4449.5s)]
*  My favorite of all time [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4451.5s)]
*  was my background on my phone [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4453.5s)]
*  was Leandre Lowe. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4455.5s)]
*  It was one of my close friends. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4457.5s)]
*  That was the craziest thing ever. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4459.5s)]
*  He trained with you? [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4461.5s)]
*  I fought him twice and then we used to train together. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4463.5s)]
*  He came and stayed with me [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4465.5s)]
*  before he passed. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4467.5s)]
*  What was your record when you guys fought? [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4469.5s)]
*  He was my idol. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4471.5s)]
*  He was just unbelievable? [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4473.5s)]
*  He's the best ever. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4475.5s)]
*  He's just a fucking animal. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4477.5s)]
*  It's something about when someone doesn't want to lose. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4479.5s)]
*  He just did not want to lose. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4481.5s)]
*  This guy, he would come in sometimes [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4483.5s)]
*  hungover puking and he just would beat everybody. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4485.5s)]
*  He was so competitive. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4487.5s)]
*  Physically gifted. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4489.5s)]
*  I never felt hips like that. I shot at him and he knocked me over. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4491.5s)]
*  What does that mean? Hips like that? [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4493.5s)]
*  His hips were so strong. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4495.5s)]
*  They ask people this question, diverse them, [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4497.5s)]
*  they would be like it's just weird to explain. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4499.5s)]
*  He was just so good. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4501.5s)]
*  He was just in the prime of his career. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4503.5s)]
*  What happened to him? [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4505.5s)]
*  I'll tell you the full story. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4507.5s)]
*  It's crazy because during that time I was going to throw my stuff. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4509.5s)]
*  That could happen to me very easily. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4511.5s)]
*  He was just at a nightclub [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4513.5s)]
*  and some guy took a bottle from his table [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4515.5s)]
*  and he took the guy down and choked him. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4517.5s)]
*  The guy was like stop, stop, I'm good. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4519.5s)]
*  He let the guy up and they were partying [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4521.5s)]
*  and the guy was a jealous guy [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4523.5s)]
*  and he was staring at him, walked back and forth, walked back and forth. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4525.5s)]
*  He just shot him right in the head. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4527.5s)]
*  One bullet right to the... [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4529.5s)]
*  It killed him. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4531.5s)]
*  It's fucking crazy, bro. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4533.5s)]
*  Who knows about that? [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4535.5s)]
*  Me partying in the city getting fucking shit faced every night. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4537.5s)]
*  I got put nice. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4539.5s)]
*  You never know who you're going to be. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4541.5s)]
*  I'm very hated too. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4543.5s)]
*  You don't know who's after you. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4545.5s)]
*  Who knows? [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4547.5s)]
*  Leandro was way nicer than me. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4549.5s)]
*  Show us a video of him. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4551.5s)]
*  I don't know, you want to watch that? [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4553.5s)]
*  I'm just trying to understand. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4555.5s)]
*  These two guys you just had the most respect for. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4557.5s)]
*  But it seems like people to earn your respect is not easy. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4559.5s)]
*  You know what's funny? [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4561.5s)]
*  I never told anybody. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4563.5s)]
*  I got in trouble with Marcelo because one time he went to dinner [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4565.5s)]
*  and he asked me, this was a long time ago, I was at Brownbell, [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4567.5s)]
*  and he asked me about the Diaz brothers. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4569.5s)]
*  So him and the Diaz had beef but I didn't know. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4571.5s)]
*  He said, what do you think about the Diaz brothers? [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4573.5s)]
*  I said, I think they're awesome, giving the finger, doing all this thing. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4575.5s)]
*  And he suspended me. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4577.5s)]
*  Marcelo did? [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4579.5s)]
*  Because they behaved in a way that wasn't with the Jiu Jitsu code. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4581.5s)]
*  They really suspended me from the gym for a second. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4583.5s)]
*  I didn't even know. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4585.5s)]
*  That's how he was. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4587.5s)]
*  Do you think he was trying to instill some sort of discipline in you? [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4589.5s)]
*  Or a character that he believed in? [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4591.5s)]
*  When we had the conversation, I said, Marcelo, listen, [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4593.5s)]
*  I had to make money, I had to pay my bills. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4595.5s)]
*  And he was like, yeah, but I do it for the love of the sport. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4597.5s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, but the love of the sport doesn't pay my bills. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4599.5s)]
*  You gotta make this stuff exciting. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4601.5s)]
*  I knew at the time, the entertainment, all this. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4603.5s)]
*  And then when I looked up a corner, I started learning more about [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4605.5s)]
*  marketing and everything. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4607.5s)]
*  And I always had that in me. I always liked to talk shit. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4609.5s)]
*  My natural personality is just banter and like that. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4611.5s)]
*  And I would just do that. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4613.5s)]
*  And then he just was like, I don't want my kids around this. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4615.5s)]
*  They might grow up being shit talkers. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4617.5s)]
*  So he's trying to protect his idea of jujitsu. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4619.5s)]
*  And while at the same time, he's trained you since you were a kid. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4621.5s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you ever hear him talking about me? [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4625.5s)]
*  He loves you. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4627.5s)]
*  Yeah, so I mean, it's hard. It's probably heartbreaking. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4629.5s)]
*  I texted him when he has cancer now. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4631.5s)]
*  Yeah, and I texted him saying, I hope you're doing good. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4633.5s)]
*  And he just said, thank you. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4635.5s)]
*  I think you should go check on him. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4637.5s)]
*  It's hard, bro, because he loved me. He was the one that loved me. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4639.5s)]
*  He was like my dad. He kicked me out. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4641.5s)]
*  Yeah, but sometimes you need to do that because you still have some sort of discipline. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4643.5s)]
*  Okay, there's a difference though. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4645.5s)]
*  Because if you would have just suspended me and my friend Munch at the time, right? [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4647.5s)]
*  Unpublicly. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4651.5s)]
*  But then he went and made a video and did it outside. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4653.5s)]
*  What's that like line? You don't discipline your kids in public? [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4655.5s)]
*  Yeah, I hear what you're saying. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4657.5s)]
*  You know what I mean? You felt like it was... [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4659.5s)]
*  He made a flow-grappling video, 20 minutes of talking, why he suspended us. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4661.5s)]
*  You don't discipline your kids in public. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4663.5s)]
*  Do you think that he thought that that might... [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4665.5s)]
*  If he really cared about this, then he wouldn't have done that. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4667.5s)]
*  But also if you really cared about him, you could have like changed a little bit of your marketing tactics too. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4669.5s)]
*  But why can't I just be me? [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4673.5s)]
*  But I'm just saying like you see StyleBender. StyleBender is great at marketing, but he doesn't do like the distasteful style of marketing. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4675.5s)]
*  I guess so. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4681.5s)]
*  He could have tweaked it a little bit. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4683.5s)]
*  I mean Izzy will go wild too. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4685.5s)]
*  What I've noticed about Izzy is like Izzy will do whatever he wants to do. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4687.5s)]
*  Like he's a true... [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4691.5s)]
*  Like distasteful. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4693.5s)]
*  Yeah, I hear what you're saying. This might not be... [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4695.5s)]
*  But let's see it. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4697.5s)]
*  So this is at the time, this is Guy. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4699.5s)]
*  And this is when? [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4701.5s)]
*  And so what made him so special in terms of his ability to dominate? [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4703.5s)]
*  He just did not stop. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4707.5s)]
*  He was so good. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4709.5s)]
*  And how did you guys go from... [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4711.5s)]
*  How did you guys go from like competitors to... [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4713.5s)]
*  Because I was always like cool with him. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4715.5s)]
*  You admired him. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4717.5s)]
*  Yeah, and he used to like help me out when I was at Brown Belt. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4719.5s)]
*  And it's funny enough, I started dating his ex-girlfriend. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4721.5s)]
*  And he used to like send her like drug messages like you pick the guy that's going to be me to like date and all this stuff. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4723.5s)]
*  Was he okay with you doing that? [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4727.5s)]
*  I feel like he would never do that. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4729.5s)]
*  And then we would go to the States and stay with me and we would train. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4731.5s)]
*  And he was cool with it because he didn't really like... [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4733.5s)]
*  He got over it and then we just became friends and we competed a bunch. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4735.5s)]
*  And then we'd just hang out. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4737.5s)]
*  And then he stopped talking to me when I looked up at Connor because he didn't like the whole thing too. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4739.5s)]
*  And then he apologized like come train with me and then he would come to stay with me. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4743.5s)]
*  And then that happened. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4747.5s)]
*  So these two guys that you really admire, you look up to, are no longer in your life. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4749.5s)]
*  And that happens... [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4753.5s)]
*  Marcel was tougher though because Marcel was like my dad. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4755.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's Pops. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4757.5s)]
*  I've poured so much into you, I can imagine for fucking years. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4759.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's a tough conversation because you know... [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4761.5s)]
*  I don't know, I feel like in my opinion you don't leave the people that you love in any way. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4763.5s)]
*  And that's why I lost a lot of friends I guess. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4769.5s)]
*  Because I'm different, you know. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4771.5s)]
*  Like if you were going through something I would show up at your house and make sure you were alright. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4773.5s)]
*  And you feel like a lot of people didn't do that for you. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4775.5s)]
*  Not to get emotional here, this is supposed to be a comedy. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4779.5s)]
*  No, this is good. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4781.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's just like, I don't know. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4783.5s)]
*  It's fucked man. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4785.5s)]
*  You don't put that much time into somebody and you put time into him as well. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4787.5s)]
*  I mean we were a team. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4791.5s)]
*  He's my coach, he's my dad. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4793.5s)]
*  You gotta go see him. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4795.5s)]
*  I can't do that. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4797.5s)]
*  Yes you can. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4799.5s)]
*  I'm not trying to be dark but there's a clock ticking now so it's like you gotta go. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4801.5s)]
*  Well I think he might have beat the cancer, I don't know. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4803.5s)]
*  So you're like, well now I don't know. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4807.5s)]
*  I sent him a message, we don't have to talk in ears. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4811.5s)]
*  That was just out of respect. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4813.5s)]
*  And the fact that he reached out, lets you know. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4815.5s)]
*  And the one thing, I was talking about my ex best friend. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4817.5s)]
*  I don't want to get too much into it because he knows a lot about this but my dad passed away. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4819.5s)]
*  And we weren't talking at the time. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4823.5s)]
*  And what really upset me was... [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4825.5s)]
*  He could have reached out. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4827.5s)]
*  Well that, or because he knows my family, he knew my dad. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4829.5s)]
*  He could have came to the funeral, sat in the back and just paid his respects and left and not talk to me. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4831.5s)]
*  And that would have meant the world to me. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4835.5s)]
*  And he didn't do that. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4837.5s)]
*  And that shit fucking broke my heart. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4839.5s)]
*  Because he's my closest friend since I was 14. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4841.5s)]
*  And just for like, if his dad passed... [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4843.5s)]
*  What stopped you guys from... [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4845.5s)]
*  We train together every day, we don't talk. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4847.5s)]
*  What? [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4849.5s)]
*  He knows the whole story. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4851.5s)]
*  We've been best friends since we were 14. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4855.5s)]
*  Can you get... [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4857.5s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta get past this. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4859.5s)]
*  And then there was something like... [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4861.5s)]
*  He said, I don't want to get too deep into it because I don't want to air our dirty laundry. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4865.5s)]
*  But it just fucked up. That hurt me the most to be honest with you though. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4869.5s)]
*  Like you know my dad passed, he just showed up and sat in the back and gave a hug to my mom. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4871.5s)]
*  What if he came to you right now and he said, listen, some things happened between us... [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4875.5s)]
*  Yeah, I wouldn't mind. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4879.5s)]
*  There you go, some things happened between us, my bad. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4881.5s)]
*  But I wish I came to the funeral and I apologize. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4883.5s)]
*  And I'm going to regret that for a long time. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4886.5s)]
*  I'm a man bro, like listen, if you come to me like that, yeah, 100%. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4888.5s)]
*  100%. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4890.5s)]
*  Could you apologize to him for anything? [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4892.5s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4894.5s)]
*  Because he disses himself for me when I was doing the wrong things because he was trying to stay on the right path. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4896.5s)]
*  I respect that. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4900.5s)]
*  And I respect that too. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4902.5s)]
*  But it comes a point in time where you still have to be there for someone. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4904.5s)]
*  Like I get it and I understand what he was doing and now I'm doing better. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4906.5s)]
*  And you come and say, hey, this is the guy I wanted you to be. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4910.5s)]
*  Now I'll be, you know, this is what I wanted. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4912.5s)]
*  Now I'll be friends with you or something like that. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4914.5s)]
*  That's different, you know what I mean? [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4916.5s)]
*  But like just, yeah, I don't know, this is weird to talk about. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4918.5s)]
*  How'd you get out of that dark place you was at? [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4920.5s)]
*  That's a great question. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4922.5s)]
*  Hey Robb Bottom. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4924.5s)]
*  I don't want... [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4926.5s)]
*  Let's just talk. We just talked. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4928.5s)]
*  You're going to have so many more stories in your life. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4930.5s)]
*  Yeah, I hit a Robb Bottom and I saw the people around me that loved me scared for my life. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4932.5s)]
*  And that hurt the most. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4938.5s)]
*  And I saw myself falling down a deep path that I wasn't going to be able to get out of. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4940.5s)]
*  Did your mom step in? [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4944.5s)]
*  Tried to. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4946.5s)]
*  I wasn't really letting anybody in. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4948.5s)]
*  So you did it yourself. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4950.5s)]
*  And I had to because I knew I'm wasting time. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4952.5s)]
*  How hard was it to... [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4954.5s)]
*  Still hard. It doesn't go away. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4956.5s)]
*  You've been sober for... [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4958.5s)]
*  Eight months. But I'm not one of those guys who's never going to drink again or anything like that. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4960.5s)]
*  No, no, but... [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4962.5s)]
*  It was just where I was in life where I couldn't train, I couldn't fight. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4964.5s)]
*  My dad passed, my friend passed. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4966.5s)]
*  There was just so much going on at one time. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4968.5s)]
*  It was just so easy to... [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4970.5s)]
*  Just drown yourself. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4972.5s)]
*  Basically, every single day from morning till night. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4974.5s)]
*  Wow. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4976.5s)]
*  I don't want to talk about it. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4978.5s)]
*  You don't have to talk about anything you don't want to. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4980.5s)]
*  Fight promoter, I love this guy. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4982.5s)]
*  I got it. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4984.5s)]
*  I understand you don't want to maybe talk about these things. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4986.5s)]
*  I'll answer some things. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4988.5s)]
*  That being said, there are other people that also have either gone through these things or they might be going through these things. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4990.5s)]
*  And it's very nice for them to know that they're not alone in that situation. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4994.5s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=4998.5s)]
*  Yeah, I mean... [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5000.5s)]
*  I don't know what I want to say. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5002.5s)]
*  You don't have to say anything. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5004.5s)]
*  No, because I want to say what Rob Bonham was, but I don't know if I want to. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5006.5s)]
*  It got to a point where I almost died. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5008.5s)]
*  And then there was a couple of times that I just didn't want to be here anymore. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5010.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5012.5s)]
*  100%. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5014.5s)]
*  That's fucking scary. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5016.5s)]
*  And I still deal with that stuff daily. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5018.5s)]
*  But yeah, I don't know. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5020.5s)]
*  A lot of regrets. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5022.5s)]
*  Can you forgive yourself enough? [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5024.5s)]
*  Not yet, I don't know. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5026.5s)]
*  Because that's important shit. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5028.5s)]
*  I know, it's hard. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5030.5s)]
*  You can bleep a name if you want. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5032.5s)]
*  Yeah, I never went to A or anything like that. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5034.5s)]
*  I talked to Theo Vaughn because he's gone through. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5036.5s)]
*  And me and him talked for a little bit. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5038.5s)]
*  He's so good at talking. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5040.5s)]
*  He deals with the same stuff I deal with. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5042.5s)]
*  But he doesn't drink anymore. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5044.5s)]
*  I plan on eventually just controlling it. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5046.5s)]
*  Because I don't think it was alcohol. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5048.5s)]
*  It was just advice. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5050.5s)]
*  It could have been fucking cookies. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5052.5s)]
*  But it was just... [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5054.5s)]
*  I'm fucking hurt. I can't train. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5056.5s)]
*  Everybody's saying, this guy fucking sucks. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5058.5s)]
*  He ruined his career. Ariel's saying, what happened to his phenom? [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5060.5s)]
*  I lost my friends, I lost everything. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5062.5s)]
*  I lost my girlfriend. I fucking went through all this shit. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5064.5s)]
*  I lost friends. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5066.5s)]
*  I'm like, shit, what's the best thing to do? [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5068.5s)]
*  Just get fucking annihilated. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5070.5s)]
*  And then you go to the city and you have every single dude that fucking loves you. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5072.5s)]
*  Thousands of fucking supermodels. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5074.5s)]
*  Everything's for free. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5076.5s)]
*  And then it's like, okay, what am I doing here? [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5078.5s)]
*  I'm just going out every night. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5080.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5082.5s)]
*  Were you still training during this? [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5084.5s)]
*  Trying to. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5086.5s)]
*  Interesting. So training has just become such a part of your life that... [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5088.5s)]
*  I think that's what started this. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5090.5s)]
*  It was a knee injury. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5092.5s)]
*  Because I didn't have that calmness. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5094.5s)]
*  It's like taking a shot. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5096.5s)]
*  And then when you're stuck like this and you have nothing to do, [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5098.5s)]
*  and then dude, I was like a menace. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5100.5s)]
*  Dude, you don't realize how, [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5102.5s)]
*  well we don't realize how dependent we are on exercise until it's removed from our lives. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5104.5s)]
*  It can calm that brain, dude. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5106.5s)]
*  The relaxation you get, [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5108.5s)]
*  you go on a long fucking run, [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5110.5s)]
*  or I imagine, like I see the guys training Jiu Jitsu, [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5112.5s)]
*  they're just drenched afterwards. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5114.5s)]
*  And you don't realize it until you're stuck and you can't move. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5116.5s)]
*  And then you realize what you've actually been doing. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5118.5s)]
*  And then you realize you have nine months ahead of you. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5120.5s)]
*  And then like, maybe I'd call me a pussy, [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5122.5s)]
*  I couldn't see the future. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5124.5s)]
*  I just saw the now and I was like, bro... [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5126.5s)]
*  And your shit didn't get fixed in nine months. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5128.5s)]
*  I went to HSS and it failed. That's the best hospital in the country. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5130.5s)]
*  What's HSS? [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5132.5s)]
*  It's like a special... [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5134.5s)]
*  HSS in Manhattan. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5136.5s)]
*  It's like the best hospital in Manhattan. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5138.5s)]
*  But it's obviously knee... [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5140.5s)]
*  It's like they do everything. They're like the best hospital and they sponsor the UFC. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5142.5s)]
*  So it fails at HSS. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5144.5s)]
*  You go back to HSS? [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5146.5s)]
*  No, I go to a different doctor and he fixed it. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5148.5s)]
*  And did he know what they did wrong? [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5150.5s)]
*  So they had to get cadaver. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5152.5s)]
*  So I have Achilles, someone's dead Achilles and stuff like that. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5154.5s)]
*  Get out of here. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5156.5s)]
*  They say you have their dreams. I have some crazy dreams. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5158.5s)]
*  Really? What kind of dreams? [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5160.5s)]
*  Crazy shit. I don't know. Asian woman. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5162.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5164.5s)]
*  I am a samurai. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5166.5s)]
*  I don't know. There's crazy dreams, bro. I don't know. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5168.5s)]
*  But yeah, it's crazy shit. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5170.5s)]
*  So the cadaver ligaments took. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5172.5s)]
*  Because I remember in Miami... [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5174.5s)]
*  Did I have this... [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5176.5s)]
*  Bro, in Miami you were showing me your knee moving and the fucking joint. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5178.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5180.5s)]
*  You remember that? [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5182.5s)]
*  That Nick Chubbs guy, he had less damage than I had. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5184.5s)]
*  I mean it was gnarly. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5186.5s)]
*  I remember you would move your whole fucking... [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5188.5s)]
*  I threw everything out besides my ACL. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5190.5s)]
*  Two times. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5192.5s)]
*  It's like being in two major cardiac exams in the same year. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5194.5s)]
*  And was it from... [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5196.5s)]
*  Did somebody do a leg... [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5198.5s)]
*  No, it was actually with Connor. It wasn't even anything crazy. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5200.5s)]
*  I think it was just because that day we were supposed to train at two. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5202.5s)]
*  I'm not saying this is because of him. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5204.5s)]
*  But then media came so he was like, oh we're going to push a training session. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5206.5s)]
*  So I was just sitting on the side waiting. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5208.5s)]
*  Oh you weren't warm and then you went after him. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5210.5s)]
*  And then we went and it was weird. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5212.5s)]
*  I was just lifting a butterfly. There's a video of it. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5214.5s)]
*  I was just lifting a butterfly hook on him and he dropped his weight back towards my foot. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5216.5s)]
*  Just with his butt. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5218.5s)]
*  And it just snapped in half. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5220.5s)]
*  My leg was like snapped. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5222.5s)]
*  What's a butterfly? [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5224.5s)]
*  So like when you lift someone with your leg. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5226.5s)]
*  So his legs are on that and you're trying to get position. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5228.5s)]
*  No, I'm on bottom. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5230.5s)]
*  And I'm trying to lift and elevate. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5232.5s)]
*  And he just dropped his hips towards my foot and my knee snapped. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5234.5s)]
*  It's a regular thing. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5236.5s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5238.5s)]
*  And it takes your identity away. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5240.5s)]
*  You built up this thing your whole life. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5242.5s)]
*  You're like I am a fighter. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5244.5s)]
*  And then you go to just sitting in a room and you're done. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5246.5s)]
*  And you can't do anything. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5248.5s)]
*  And then you're on crutches at fucking clubs and fucking knocking people out. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5250.5s)]
*  I was fucking getting at the fights left and right. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5252.5s)]
*  Just fucking drunk. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5254.5s)]
*  Because now you're more defensive than ever. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5256.5s)]
*  Because before you were, before that happened, you probably had the utmost confidence in your ability. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5258.5s)]
*  Why would you fight anybody? [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5262.5s)]
*  If you know you can beat people up. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5264.5s)]
*  You know what it was? I was just a drunk mess and people would say some stupid shit. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5266.5s)]
*  I knocked some guy out with my crutch. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5268.5s)]
*  I was breaking ubers. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5270.5s)]
*  I was doing like crazy shit. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5272.5s)]
*  So you were just being an asshole. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5274.5s)]
*  Hurt people hurt people. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5276.5s)]
*  How long do you want to be in the fight game? [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5278.5s)]
*  Until I win a world championship. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5282.5s)]
*  And then you feel like you'd be okay? [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5284.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5286.5s)]
*  I haven't thought about that. It's a tough question. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5288.5s)]
*  What is Dylan Danis doing at 50? [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5290.5s)]
*  I don't know. I think about that. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5292.5s)]
*  Because it's hard because I live such a crazy lifestyle. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5294.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5296.5s)]
*  Maybe just fucking on a yacht somewhere. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5298.5s)]
*  Hopefully I make enough money to be in a yacht and just be chilling. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5300.5s)]
*  Could you just chill? Relax? [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5302.5s)]
*  Right now? Yes. I don't have to fight. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5304.5s)]
*  I have money. I really do. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5306.5s)]
*  People say that. But like, do you guys know how it is with sponsors? [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5308.5s)]
*  I understand you get sponsors and you can monetize the influence. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5310.5s)]
*  But there's going to be a time where maybe that influence isn't as great. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5312.5s)]
*  Of course. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5314.5s)]
*  So you want to prepare yourself. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5316.5s)]
*  I save my money well. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5318.5s)]
*  You don't sound like you do. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5320.5s)]
*  You go out all the time and you just get $5,000 out of strip clubs. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5322.5s)]
*  It sounds terrible but like, [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5324.5s)]
*  when you're popular everything is free. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5326.5s)]
*  He knows. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5328.5s)]
*  I don't want to sound like you're free. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5330.5s)]
*  Not everything but you might get more things for free. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5332.5s)]
*  I don't have to pay for anything. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5334.5s)]
*  But that doesn't want to sound like a dick. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5336.5s)]
*  Everything is free. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5338.5s)]
*  Okay but, [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5340.5s)]
*  I'm just trying to think. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5342.5s)]
*  That's why I mentioned earlier, why don't you pivot more towards that [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5344.5s)]
*  influencer fighting game? [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5346.5s)]
*  I want to keep down. I want to be able to live with myself on my deathbed if I just want to fight YouTube. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5348.5s)]
*  I want to fight the best. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5350.5s)]
*  And listen, if I lose, I lose. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5352.5s)]
*  Also the influence comes from being a fighter. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5354.5s)]
*  Like, I know personally, [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5356.5s)]
*  Connor is a great example. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5358.5s)]
*  When I know Connor is interested in fighting again, [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5360.5s)]
*  all of his businesses mean more. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5362.5s)]
*  The alcohol means more. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5364.5s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5366.5s)]
*  He's a winner in that influencer fighting group. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5368.5s)]
*  What I'm trying to say is like, [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5370.5s)]
*  Connor is a brilliant businessman [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5372.5s)]
*  regardless of whether he's fighting or not. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5374.5s)]
*  But when he's also fighting, [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5376.5s)]
*  it makes all those other businesses more exciting for some reason. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5378.5s)]
*  When, you know, Tom Brady is now retired. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5380.5s)]
*  Tom Brady promoting an athletic shoe as a guy who's retired isn't exciting. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5382.5s)]
*  Even when he was going, [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5384.5s)]
*  Connor's such a good salesman. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5386.5s)]
*  He can do it. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5388.5s)]
*  What I'm trying to say is, [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5390.5s)]
*  he's smart enough to know that [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5392.5s)]
*  if I'm in this game, [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5394.5s)]
*  I can run it up. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5396.5s)]
*  That's the source of the influence. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5398.5s)]
*  But he has fuck you money now. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5400.5s)]
*  Bro, it's crazy. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5402.5s)]
*  And what I kind of like about it, [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5404.5s)]
*  is he's saying fuck you. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5406.5s)]
*  He loves to fight. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5408.5s)]
*  He's enjoying the money. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5410.5s)]
*  Some people do it and they get fucking buttoned up [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5412.5s)]
*  and they don't say what they want to say anymore. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5414.5s)]
*  He's on the yacht. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5416.5s)]
*  Look at my Lamborghini boat. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5418.5s)]
*  You're not going to take it with you when you go, bro. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5420.5s)]
*  You've got to enjoy it. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5422.5s)]
*  My thing is that the influencer fighting scene [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5424.5s)]
*  is just as popular as the real fighting scene. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5426.5s)]
*  Listen, when I'm on my deathbed, [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5428.5s)]
*  I ain't telling my kid I beat Logan Paul. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5430.5s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going to make more money. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5432.5s)]
*  I hear what Alex is saying, [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5434.5s)]
*  which is like, if you can make more money... [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5436.5s)]
*  If I want to care about the money, yeah, you're right. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5438.5s)]
*  But I care about when I'm older. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5440.5s)]
*  I'm like, okay, I was UFC champion. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5442.5s)]
*  What did I achieve in my life? [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5444.5s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5446.5s)]
*  In reality, it doesn't matter. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5448.5s)]
*  Have you thought about if you don't win at all? [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5450.5s)]
*  Do those thoughts creep in? [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5452.5s)]
*  It sounds terrible, but it's not a real fight. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5454.5s)]
*  It's a boxing fight. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5456.5s)]
*  It wouldn't affect your ego? [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5458.5s)]
*  Listen, because I know I could choke him out in 30 seconds. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5460.5s)]
*  It's like Nate Diaz when he gets Jake. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5462.5s)]
*  He's like, you can't really fight. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5464.5s)]
*  Fight me in a real fight, then. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5466.5s)]
*  If you beat me in MMA, then you could be like, okay. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5468.5s)]
*  There's a reason he's picking a jujitsu guy. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5470.5s)]
*  I've never boxed before here. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5472.5s)]
*  When Nate fought Leon Edwards, [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5474.5s)]
*  shout out to Leon who was on the pod, [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5476.5s)]
*  and Nate fought Leon Edwards, [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5478.5s)]
*  and with about a minute left, [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5480.5s)]
*  he caught him with that left hook. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5482.5s)]
*  No, straight. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5484.5s)]
*  It was a straight left. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5486.5s)]
*  Then he pointed at him. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5488.5s)]
*  Leon struggled to make it through the end of the round. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5490.5s)]
*  Nate goes, [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5492.5s)]
*  if this was on the street, [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5494.5s)]
*  you're dead. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5496.5s)]
*  It's the same thing when he knocked down Nate in the fight. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5498.5s)]
*  Jake, if you were on top of him, Nate would have triangle him. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5500.5s)]
*  So boxing is like, what is it? [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5502.5s)]
*  It's so stupid, but whatever. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5504.5s)]
*  I guess what I'm trying to say is having that perspective on fighting. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5506.5s)]
*  To me, [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5508.5s)]
*  I'm looking at this like Nate goes, I view myself as a fighter. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5510.5s)]
*  There are restrictions to my ability to fight [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5512.5s)]
*  in this certain scenario. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5514.5s)]
*  And given those restrictions, [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5516.5s)]
*  you got to win today, [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5518.5s)]
*  but we both know, you and I as men know [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5520.5s)]
*  what could have happened. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5522.5s)]
*  You're good at this. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5524.5s)]
*  I'm just saying, [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5526.5s)]
*  I understand your, what is this? [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5528.5s)]
*  Zins, bro. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5530.5s)]
*  But it's the hefe, dog. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5532.5s)]
*  Don't we have some zins? I don't trust the zins. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5534.5s)]
*  Why would I ever give you anything fake? [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5536.5s)]
*  Why would you ever give me ecstasy? [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5538.5s)]
*  Why would you ever give me anything fake? [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5540.5s)]
*  That's real. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5542.5s)]
*  That's real. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5544.5s)]
*  Let's f*** up, you call my watch, I'll take yours in. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5546.5s)]
*  So you think I'm not, I'm... [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5548.5s)]
*  I can do three at one time. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5550.5s)]
*  Dude, don't do three. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5552.5s)]
*  I can do four, I can do two on the top, two on the bottom. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5554.5s)]
*  Bro, upper deckies, dude? [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5556.5s)]
*  This guy's wild. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5558.5s)]
*  How much do you put in? Just one. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5560.5s)]
*  And I take it out every 15 seconds and set it on my f***ing, [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5562.5s)]
*  what's it called? [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5564.5s)]
*  Ah, f*** it, man. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5566.5s)]
*  You guys can't do two? No, I love zins. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5568.5s)]
*  I've tried to get all of this. Go two, come on. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5570.5s)]
*  I'm going to take it out and put it right here. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5572.5s)]
*  I rest it like a cigarette. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5574.5s)]
*  Just take it out and put it in? [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5576.5s)]
*  In and out, every once in a while. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5578.5s)]
*  Should we get back to the fun shit? [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5580.5s)]
*  No, this is the beauty of conversation. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5582.5s)]
*  Like waking up being like, [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5584.5s)]
*  who hates me on Twitter today? [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5586.5s)]
*  Walking down the street being like, does that guy want to fight me? [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5588.5s)]
*  Nah, now I'm good with whatever it is. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5590.5s)]
*  A serious question? [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5592.5s)]
*  You have a kid, and I'm not taking any shots. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5594.5s)]
*  Do you think about, when you think about legacy... [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5596.5s)]
*  Also, I saw the dad thing and I was so f***ed. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5598.5s)]
*  It's a crazy feeling. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5600.5s)]
*  Like I get goosebumps even thinking about it. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5602.5s)]
*  Has it changed your perspective on anything in terms of lifestyle? [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5604.5s)]
*  Anything like that? [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5606.5s)]
*  Well, lifestyle and also, when you clearly think about legacy, [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5608.5s)]
*  and that's something... [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5610.5s)]
*  I can tell that's something you want to tell your kids. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5612.5s)]
*  Because kids are a mirror, right? [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5614.5s)]
*  Like everything that... [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5616.5s)]
*  That's kind of what I hear, is that [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5618.5s)]
*  your kid exposes who you are because they start [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5620.5s)]
*  copying the things that you do. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5622.5s)]
*  So does that make you reassess kind of the trolling aspect of it? [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5624.5s)]
*  And there's no lines? [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5626.5s)]
*  No, no. I haven't thought that far. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5628.5s)]
*  Does it make you... [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5630.5s)]
*  Connor has kids and he still does this thing. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5632.5s)]
*  I mean, I think when you explain to them, [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5634.5s)]
*  like listen, this is a fight business, it's like any other job. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5636.5s)]
*  I'm not like... [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5638.5s)]
*  There's not one person that's ever met me like, [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5640.5s)]
*  guys, kids are scumbags. No one. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5642.5s)]
*  You know a lot of people that know me. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5644.5s)]
*  I'm the nicest person ever. But when it comes to business, [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5646.5s)]
*  it's different. So maybe I guess explain that to him. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5648.5s)]
*  But do you care about legacy for your kid or legacy for yourself? [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5650.5s)]
*  Both. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5652.5s)]
*  If it's for your kid, yeah. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5654.5s)]
*  I see his face. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5656.5s)]
*  But the kids like these fucking influencers. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5658.5s)]
*  One day they do the fucking fighters. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5660.5s)]
*  What you're saying in training... [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5662.5s)]
*  Yeah, sometimes when the rounds are getting hard, [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5664.5s)]
*  I think about, I look at him, like, [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5666.5s)]
*  he's going to have to see me fight. I want to win. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5668.5s)]
*  So it pushes me harder. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5670.5s)]
*  100%. And dude, there's a weird feeling [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5672.5s)]
*  when you put your kid on your chest and there's no one there, [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5674.5s)]
*  bro, it's a weird feeling. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5676.5s)]
*  It's like a primitive feeling, bro. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5678.5s)]
*  So then it just gets you right. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5680.5s)]
*  Is your mom super involved? [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5682.5s)]
*  I'm fucking excited. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5684.5s)]
*  I said this, the most thing that made me the happiest [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5686.5s)]
*  is seeing how happy she is when she's with them. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5688.5s)]
*  I mean, is this her first grant? [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5690.5s)]
*  Oh, so she's like... [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5692.5s)]
*  And it makes me happy because she goes through a lot. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5694.5s)]
*  I like seeing that. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5696.5s)]
*  They say that grandchildren are the gift that you give your parents for raising you. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5698.5s)]
*  Because they get... [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5704.5s)]
*  Oh, they cry a lot, so... [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5706.5s)]
*  They get to finally, they get to just pour love into a human being. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5708.5s)]
*  And I think it's crazy for them to see their legacy. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5710.5s)]
*  Like, you know what I mean? Like, passed down. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5712.5s)]
*  Like, it's a weird thing, you know? It's crazy. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5714.5s)]
*  And they get to have a kid without the same responsibility. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5716.5s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. They get to get the fuck parts. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5718.5s)]
*  They get to be just loved. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5720.5s)]
*  No discipline, no structure. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5722.5s)]
*  Well, I don't have a girl, but my baby mama's very understanding. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5724.5s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5726.5s)]
*  She's very cool. So when I'm at training camp, she doesn't bother. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5728.5s)]
*  She knows, and I go see him, and she's so cool. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5730.5s)]
*  Now, that's not public. You haven't shared... [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5732.5s)]
*  No, I hope she is. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5734.5s)]
*  That's probably a better... [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5736.5s)]
*  It's not because of me, though. I don't want to hide her. I don't care. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5738.5s)]
*  I think that that's... [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5740.5s)]
*  Oh, I thought that was her. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5742.5s)]
*  Yeah, that was crazy. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5744.5s)]
*  Yeah, so that's her. That's her, not me. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5746.5s)]
*  Wow, man. Good for you. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5748.5s)]
*  Good for you. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5750.5s)]
*  Definitely came at a crazy timing, but I guess life does weird things sometimes. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5752.5s)]
*  What is that thing that people always say, there's never the perfect time? [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5754.5s)]
*  I guess so, yeah. I mean, there's a lot going on right now in my life, but... [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5758.5s)]
*  Yeah, but maybe that's good. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5760.5s)]
*  Yeah, but maybe it's always... [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5762.5s)]
*  I control the chaos, right? [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5764.5s)]
*  It's never when you want it, but it's always on time. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5766.5s)]
*  I definitely do now after all the things I went through. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5768.5s)]
*  Really? [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5770.5s)]
*  Yeah, because I shouldn't be alive. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5772.5s)]
*  Really? Rekindled your faith? [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5774.5s)]
*  100%, yeah. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5776.5s)]
*  I mean, someone's looking after me. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5778.5s)]
*  For sure, because I... [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5780.5s)]
*  I went through some terrible things. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5782.5s)]
*  You know? [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5784.5s)]
*  I don't want to get too deep, because I always say I don't want to talk about this stuff. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5786.5s)]
*  You don't have to talk about anything? [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5788.5s)]
*  I definitely came out the other side somehow. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5790.5s)]
*  But, you know, it is what it is. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5792.5s)]
*  Really? [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5794.5s)]
*  So you're trying to find yourself praying more? [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5796.5s)]
*  I'm praying more, just... [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5798.5s)]
*  Believing in something higher? [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5800.5s)]
*  Yeah, I guess so, yeah. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5802.5s)]
*  That is crazy to come out of it and then have a child? [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5804.5s)]
*  Yeah, and I get scared because, like, what happens when I fall back into that? [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5806.5s)]
*  Well, now you have another reason not to. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5808.5s)]
*  Yeah, I know, but... [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5810.5s)]
*  Those are those extra two rounds where you're like, all right, let's dig deep. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5812.5s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5814.5s)]
*  Because you can't... [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5816.5s)]
*  Little man can't have that. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5818.5s)]
*  I know. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5820.5s)]
*  I dealt with it. My real dad was alcohol. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5822.5s)]
*  And he ruined it. He was in 9-11. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5824.5s)]
*  And after that, I became an alcoholic. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5826.5s)]
*  And recently he passed out. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5828.5s)]
*  I don't know if you saw, Logan was making fun of it, like a scumbag. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5830.5s)]
*  He called me a scumbag, but he was saying stuff about it. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5832.5s)]
*  It looked like that hurt you. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5834.5s)]
*  It didn't hurt me. I just said to him, like, [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5836.5s)]
*  if you say something, like, it's going to be on or not. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5838.5s)]
*  And then he was like, oh, I empathize with you. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5840.5s)]
*  So he didn't say anything bad, but I was like, say something, watch what happens. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5842.5s)]
*  So I was about to get out. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5844.5s)]
*  Really? [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5846.5s)]
*  But he's smart, because he's scared of me. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5848.5s)]
*  He knows that I would kill him. He's not dumb. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5850.5s)]
*  He's not a real fighter. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5852.5s)]
*  And when I said that, he changed his demeanor. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5854.5s)]
*  He was like, oh, I empathize with you. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5856.5s)]
*  This and that. I was like, yeah, say something, watch. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5858.5s)]
*  What has changed? [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5860.5s)]
*  You went through a point in time, right, [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5862.5s)]
*  when your knee was all fucked up, where you couldn't kill people. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5864.5s)]
*  You had the ability to. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5866.5s)]
*  But the reality is, [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5868.5s)]
*  there might be a guy with no fucking experience at all. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5870.5s)]
*  And because you're hobbling around, [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5872.5s)]
*  could catch you, drop you. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5874.5s)]
*  You go from this point where you're walking around the city, [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5876.5s)]
*  and you're looking at pretty much every dude, [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5880.5s)]
*  and you're going, there's a 99% chance that if we start wrestling, [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5882.5s)]
*  I could probably tap him out. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5886.5s)]
*  I imagine. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5888.5s)]
*  I think even one leg, that's the thing that fits me. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5890.5s)]
*  Even one leg, I mean, obviously it's hard, but I could probably still. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5892.5s)]
*  Maybe you could, but there's also a chance that maybe you could. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5894.5s)]
*  I mean, at least that's good through your mind. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5896.5s)]
*  I can't imagine what's starting to happen to your psyche. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5898.5s)]
*  Do you start feeling insecure? [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5900.5s)]
*  Do you start feeling like. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5902.5s)]
*  I'm insecure because I was just, I don't know. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5904.5s)]
*  When you're a fighter, bro, I could have one leg, one arm, [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5906.5s)]
*  I'm still like, I'm that guy. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5908.5s)]
*  And alcohol helps that. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5910.5s)]
*  Alcohol gives you that confidence that you're the fucking man. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5912.5s)]
*  When you're not, I mean, look at the guys that drink, [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5914.5s)]
*  they get knocked out, it just gives you that confidence. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5916.5s)]
*  And then plus you're doing other shit, [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5918.5s)]
*  and it's just like, yeah, I don't know. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5920.5s)]
*  But you're right, though. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5922.5s)]
*  Have you felt insecure about other things? [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5924.5s)]
*  I mean, I think we all do, right? [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5926.5s)]
*  100% we do. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5928.5s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, everybody has insecurities, but. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5930.5s)]
*  And is that weird? [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5932.5s)]
*  Because most people feel insecure, and then they don't have this. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5934.5s)]
*  Not even spotlight. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5936.5s)]
*  They don't have a nuclear option, [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5938.5s)]
*  which is sometimes good. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5940.5s)]
*  The people who feel insecure often want to, [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5942.5s)]
*  they either internalize that insecurity [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5944.5s)]
*  and they want to hurt themselves, [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5946.5s)]
*  or they project that insecurity on other people, [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5948.5s)]
*  they want to hurt other people, right? [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5950.5s)]
*  But a lot of times those people don't have the ability [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5952.5s)]
*  to hurt other people. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5954.5s)]
*  A fighter does, and you see some of these fighters, [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5956.5s)]
*  they go out there, they're getting in fucking bar fights, [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5958.5s)]
*  or they knock some guy out. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5960.5s)]
*  I don't think that's right. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5962.5s)]
*  Sometimes I would say, yeah, maybe I was drunk [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5964.5s)]
*  and some guy was talking shit to me. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5966.5s)]
*  There was one time a guy was like, [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5968.5s)]
*  rich dude buying 42, [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5970.5s)]
*  he was Muslim, he didn't drink, he would just buy it [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5972.5s)]
*  and pour it. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5974.5s)]
*  I swear, that was his thing. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5976.5s)]
*  And he poured it on my shoes, and I just fucking went after him. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5978.5s)]
*  I got into a fight with the whole Rangers team, actually. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5980.5s)]
*  Really? [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5982.5s)]
*  I think it was the Rangers or it was the Oilers. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5984.5s)]
*  So we're at the club. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5986.5s)]
*  Dude, hockey dudes like to party. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5988.5s)]
*  But no, they get to fight, you know what I like about them? [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5990.5s)]
*  The owner, it was a bounce. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5992.5s)]
*  So the owner [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5994.5s)]
*  introduced me to his brother and his girl was there [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5996.5s)]
*  and his girl was on the side. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=5998.5s)]
*  And the guy kept bumping into her, and I went like, [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6000.5s)]
*  watch out, it's a girl. And he did it again. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6002.5s)]
*  So I kind of pushed him, and he was like, what the fuck? [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6004.5s)]
*  Now I know, don't let anybody get close. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6006.5s)]
*  So he came, and I fucking just tossed this dude [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6008.5s)]
*  into a fight, and then his whole team came. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6010.5s)]
*  And they tried to attack me, and I took a vodka bottle, [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6012.5s)]
*  I was like, whoever's coming close, I'm whacking. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6014.5s)]
*  And we started just fighting, and then [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6016.5s)]
*  the driver that drove me home, drove them home. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6018.5s)]
*  They were like, oh, that was awesome. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6020.5s)]
*  They were all cool about it. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6022.5s)]
*  The hockey dudes are the shit. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6024.5s)]
*  And the coolest thing about them is that most people [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6026.5s)]
*  don't know that they're hockey players when they go to the club. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6028.5s)]
*  They can look like normal fucking white dudes [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6030.5s)]
*  at parties, so they get to be [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6032.5s)]
*  in the club anonymous, and they go after it. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6034.5s)]
*  The basketball players in the club, [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6036.5s)]
*  seven feet, everybody knows who the fuck they are. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6038.5s)]
*  But the thing is, he's bumping into a woman, [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6040.5s)]
*  he's shit-faced drunk, and I was like, bro, come on. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6042.5s)]
*  So I was like, come on. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6044.5s)]
*  And then he tried to come towards me and aggressive ways. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6046.5s)]
*  If you did anything wrong, I'm just saying they might have [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6048.5s)]
*  the perfect level of fame and money. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6050.5s)]
*  Things aren't about fame. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6052.5s)]
*  I have no idea any of those guys are. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6054.5s)]
*  That's the fun. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6056.5s)]
*  You got all the money. Think about it, when you go out now to a bar, [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6058.5s)]
*  people know who you are. If you act like an asshole, [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6060.5s)]
*  people, TMZ, whatever. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6062.5s)]
*  Hockey dude, you think it's just a frat dude, [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6064.5s)]
*  but he's got 10 million in the fucking bank, [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6066.5s)]
*  he's playing a professional sport. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6068.5s)]
*  They might have figured out [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6070.5s)]
*  athlete fame. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6072.5s)]
*  Just pick an unpopular sport, [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6074.5s)]
*  and you got it. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6076.5s)]
*  Stop taking it out, I got two in. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6078.5s)]
*  You're a savage, bro. Also, I'm drinking. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6080.5s)]
*  I just dropped it in the fucking tequila. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6082.5s)]
*  That'll help. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6084.5s)]
*  Okay, what is the most... [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6086.5s)]
*  You started doing therapy sessions? [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6088.5s)]
*  What is the most proud moment of your life? [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6090.5s)]
*  This is a hard one. I can't answer. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6092.5s)]
*  Maybe winning a world championship. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6094.5s)]
*  First one? [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6096.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6098.5s)]
*  Four times. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6100.5s)]
*  Then I won the Pan Ams at Black Belt, and then I didn't really compete too much at Black Belt. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6102.5s)]
*  Okay, the first [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6104.5s)]
*  Brown Belt world championship. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6106.5s)]
*  Yeah, and the kid that I tapped twice [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6108.5s)]
*  has won the world at Black Belt five times. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6110.5s)]
*  What's his name? [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6112.5s)]
*  Gabriel Arjes. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6114.5s)]
*  There's a bunch of guys that I beat who won the world at Black Belt. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6116.5s)]
*  Okay, so you win [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6118.5s)]
*  in that moment. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6120.5s)]
*  That's like better than drugs, bro. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6122.5s)]
*  After the victory, [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6124.5s)]
*  the first moment you're by yourself. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6126.5s)]
*  What does that feel like? [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6128.5s)]
*  I had never done heroin, but I can imagine that's what it feels like. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6130.5s)]
*  Do you finally feel fulfilled? [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6132.5s)]
*  That's like the kind of serotonin or dopamine rush [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6134.5s)]
*  that is so... I can't wait for [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6136.5s)]
*  it again when I knock Logan out. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6138.5s)]
*  That's just that feeling of just... But do you think knocking Logan out will give you that same... [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6140.5s)]
*  I think it will because I haven't fought in so long. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6142.5s)]
*  So being back to a fight. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6144.5s)]
*  I love competition. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6146.5s)]
*  But explain that feeling. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6148.5s)]
*  It's literally like the best [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6150.5s)]
*  dopamine... I can't explain. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6152.5s)]
*  It's just amazing. Are you proud of the work [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6154.5s)]
*  you put in? It's just everything, bro. Your body's beat [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6156.5s)]
*  up, but you just feel... Were you with Marcelo? [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6158.5s)]
*  Do you have a moment with him at all? [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6160.5s)]
*  Do you guys hug and fucking embrace? [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6162.5s)]
*  At the time, he was my best friend, [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6164.5s)]
*  my ex-best friend, and it was just such a great [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6166.5s)]
*  moment. And then your mom's so proud of you. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6168.5s)]
*  Everybody's proud of you. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6170.5s)]
*  Was your dad there? No, me and my dad had a weird [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6172.5s)]
*  relationship, but he would watch. He was [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6174.5s)]
*  drinking at the time, so I didn't really associate with him [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6176.5s)]
*  too much. So your mom is going crazy? [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6178.5s)]
*  Marcelo's going crazy? Everybody. Your best friend is going crazy? [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6180.5s)]
*  You know what it is, too, because at the time, [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6182.5s)]
*  they believe in me, but now everybody's like, [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6184.5s)]
*  oh, this guy's in One in the World, and stuff like that. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6186.5s)]
*  So it's like a cool feeling to prove people wrong. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6188.5s)]
*  So you think of wrestling, bro. Sorry, can I ask you a question about drinking? [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6190.5s)]
*  You said you're going to drink again at some point. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6192.5s)]
*  Why? If it's in your... [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6194.5s)]
*  I love booze. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6196.5s)]
*  I love booze. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6198.5s)]
*  I also have it in my genetics, and I have family members [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6200.5s)]
*  who drank, stopped, and were like, [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6202.5s)]
*  I just want to prove to myself I'm not an alcoholic, [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6204.5s)]
*  and I can drink. The thing is, the hardest part is [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6206.5s)]
*  I love drinking. I really do. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6208.5s)]
*  You don't love drinking. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6210.5s)]
*  You love what it provides. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6212.5s)]
*  And it is nice, because it... It's like a rehab. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6214.5s)]
*  No. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6216.5s)]
*  Because honestly, I think [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6218.5s)]
*  we talk about this on the pod, like there's utility to alcohol. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6220.5s)]
*  I think alcohol allows people to connect. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6222.5s)]
*  See, you can have that drink and go home and not drink. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6224.5s)]
*  I'm not like that. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6226.5s)]
*  You like to go after it. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6228.5s)]
*  Which is why I asked my question. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6230.5s)]
*  I used to go to the bar, and I ordered 30 shots for everybody. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6232.5s)]
*  I would do it every bar. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6234.5s)]
*  I ordered 30, 40 shots. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6236.5s)]
*  I'd just get everybody drunk. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6238.5s)]
*  Were you that way before the injuries? [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6240.5s)]
*  No, I was more of like a sipper. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6242.5s)]
*  I used to do the fake, like in the club, [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6244.5s)]
*  put my tongue on it, pretend I was drinking. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6246.5s)]
*  No, no, I have that too. Drake taught me that. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6248.5s)]
*  Wait, what? [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6250.5s)]
*  I asked him one time, because I was usually, whenever I meet someone [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6252.5s)]
*  that's very high up, I would ask him, [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6254.5s)]
*  it was at XS, and I was like, dude, how do you deal with [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6256.5s)]
*  the alcohol and controlling things? [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6258.5s)]
*  He was like, you know what? Tomorrow I have to do something, [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6260.5s)]
*  or I have a studio, or I have a song I have to make. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6262.5s)]
*  He goes, when these guys give me drinks, [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6264.5s)]
*  right over the shoulder. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6266.5s)]
*  He goes, I forget, this is a long time ago. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6268.5s)]
*  He was like, you just got to know when you have to [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6270.5s)]
*  do your own, you have to do your shit. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6272.5s)]
*  Every successful person [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6274.5s)]
*  is like that. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6276.5s)]
*  Where the priority in their life [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6278.5s)]
*  is the success and the drive. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6280.5s)]
*  It's one of the best advice I ever got. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6282.5s)]
*  And instead you just lost 30 shots, [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6284.5s)]
*  and you just drank them all. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6286.5s)]
*  Why don't you just say no instead of making a mess? [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6288.5s)]
*  People make it a whole other thing. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6290.5s)]
*  The vibe gets fucked up. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6292.5s)]
*  And you want the vibe, you want the energy. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6294.5s)]
*  The whole reason you're there is for the social camaraderie, [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6296.5s)]
*  and if you're opting out, then everyone's like, [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6298.5s)]
*  wait, you're faking it? [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6300.5s)]
*  I was doing that in my 20s, but it's because I was driving, [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6302.5s)]
*  so I was like, no, I cannot keep doing these shots. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6304.5s)]
*  I'll be like, yeah, let's go, let's go. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6307.5s)]
*  I used to do the one where I would take it, [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6309.5s)]
*  but then leave it, and then throw it in the little ice thing. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6311.5s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6313.5s)]
*  And then it got to a point where I was just taking everything. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6315.5s)]
*  And then you got to make the face after. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6317.5s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6319.5s)]
*  Everybody else is drunk, no one knows. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6321.5s)]
*  But that is true, you look at the people who are [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6323.5s)]
*  uber successful, and I imagine at your run, [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6325.5s)]
*  when you were just winning world championships, [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6327.5s)]
*  I can't imagine you're a party. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6329.5s)]
*  I didn't start drinking until I was 23. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6331.5s)]
*  There you go. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6333.5s)]
*  Dude, I was thinking about this fucking yesterday, [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6335.5s)]
*  it's so weird that we're talking about this now. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6337.5s)]
*  I didn't drink from 21 to 30. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6339.5s)]
*  10 years I didn't drink. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6341.5s)]
*  I don't think I'm where I'm at today. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6343.5s)]
*  You don't drink because of religion, right? [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6345.5s)]
*  No, I had alcoholism in my family, but also [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6347.5s)]
*  it didn't seem like it was worth the cost. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6349.5s)]
*  You don't think you would be where you were without? [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6351.5s)]
*  No. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6353.5s)]
*  I don't think that I wouldn't be successful, [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6355.5s)]
*  but what alcohol steals from you [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6357.5s)]
*  is the next day sometimes. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6359.5s)]
*  I used to get hangovers for two, three days. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6361.5s)]
*  Exactly, now you can't train. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6363.5s)]
*  Not even training, your body can't recover. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6365.5s)]
*  I don't know about you, but I used to get the worst anxiety. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6367.5s)]
*  Because of drinking or before? [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6369.5s)]
*  I think I had the anxiety when I was drinking [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6371.5s)]
*  and I think it just amplifies in the morning. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6373.5s)]
*  No one helps with anxiety, more drink. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6375.5s)]
*  And then the morning, you're like, oh shit. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6377.5s)]
*  I don't drink before I go on stage. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6379.5s)]
*  Never, not a single drink. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6381.5s)]
*  And then afterwards, I'll have one, and I think [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6383.5s)]
*  it's the quickest way to decompress. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6385.5s)]
*  Not if I'm doing a spot in the city, [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6387.5s)]
*  but a big show. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6389.5s)]
*  And it's fun to get into the vibe. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6391.5s)]
*  And that camaraderie you were talking about, Mark, [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6393.5s)]
*  just being out with everybody [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6395.5s)]
*  and celebrating, [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6397.5s)]
*  it is so fun. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6399.5s)]
*  But Chino said this, it was a quote. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6401.5s)]
*  He said, they asked him, what's your favorite part about acting? [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6403.5s)]
*  In the back of the day, they used to say the drink after. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6405.5s)]
*  So that was the thing. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6407.5s)]
*  Because we accomplish something. You accomplish something as a group. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6409.5s)]
*  And I think that's the cool thing about, [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6411.5s)]
*  especially with martial arts, [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6413.5s)]
*  is that you can't train alone. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6415.5s)]
*  With Jiu Jitsu, [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6417.5s)]
*  there's a guy that's trying to choke you out every day. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6419.5s)]
*  And because of that, you can get good. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6421.5s)]
*  So that victory isn't yours, [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6423.5s)]
*  is it? [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6425.5s)]
*  And you see it with the good teams, [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6427.5s)]
*  especially in MMA, like with Izzy's team. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6429.5s)]
*  Can you imagine the pressure of being [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6431.5s)]
*  him? [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6433.5s)]
*  He deals a lot, man. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6435.5s)]
*  Sustaining, man. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6437.5s)]
*  That's the thing, guys at his level, Conor's level, [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6439.5s)]
*  like everybody can give you advice. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6441.5s)]
*  You can give advice to those people, [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6443.5s)]
*  but you haven't, not you. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6445.5s)]
*  With fighters, it's hard too, because they're just animals. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6447.5s)]
*  Bro, imagine what you need up here [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6449.5s)]
*  to get in the ring if someone's going to try to kill you. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6451.5s)]
*  So to have that perspective, [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6453.5s)]
*  imagine taking yourself from this [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6455.5s)]
*  primal war state [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6457.5s)]
*  to just, I need to be a normal person. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6459.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6461.5s)]
*  That's why fighters, it's just like, we're crazy. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6463.5s)]
*  Like Mike Tyson, like all these guys, bro, it's just... [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6465.5s)]
*  But look what these guys do eventually afterwards. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6467.5s)]
*  Mike Tyson, it feels like his life [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6469.5s)]
*  afterwards has been trying to [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6471.5s)]
*  remove those primal instincts [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6473.5s)]
*  that made him so successful. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6475.5s)]
*  Control the monster. He talks about it all the time. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6477.5s)]
*  Have you met Mike at all? [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6479.5s)]
*  I was supposed to. I was supposed to fly to Vegas [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6481.5s)]
*  to do a show, but they want me to come for one day. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6483.5s)]
*  And then he'd go and he'd film, I didn't, yeah, I was like, nah, I'm good. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6485.5s)]
*  But I always wanted to be Mike, that'd be awesome. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6487.5s)]
*  Why do you think that we all have so much admiration? [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6489.5s)]
*  The Rock follows you. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6491.5s)]
*  That's my fucking childhood, that's the reason I am. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6493.5s)]
*  Are you a wrestling guy? [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6495.5s)]
*  I'm an attitude-error, you're crazy. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6497.5s)]
*  Why do you think I talk all the shit I talk? [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6499.5s)]
*  Okay, so who are your guys? [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6501.5s)]
*  Growing up, I was a Rock. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6503.5s)]
*  So you come up in Rock era, nothing before? [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6505.5s)]
*  Bro, when me and my friends used to argue, [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6507.5s)]
*  because they used to be on TV, Rock and Austin, [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6509.5s)]
*  I thought it was real. I swear to God. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6511.5s)]
*  I used to be like, yo, Rock's in a... I thought it was a real fight. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6513.5s)]
*  And then when I found out it was fake, I stopped watching. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6515.5s)]
*  And then I started going to MMA, obviously, [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6517.5s)]
*  but I loved wrestling. I was an attitude-error guy, [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6519.5s)]
*  I loved everybody, like, Stump Cold. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6521.5s)]
*  The Rock was my guy. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6523.5s)]
*  Hey man, what do you want to eat? And then you go, [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6525.5s)]
*  it doesn't matter! [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6527.5s)]
*  The Rock is a fucking man, bro. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6529.5s)]
*  Bro, we went to the WWE, and it was actually me and him, [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6531.5s)]
*  and they gave us, like, Ray Mysterio gave us [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6533.5s)]
*  front row tickets, right? And then they were like, [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6535.5s)]
*  we just got there, and he was like, oh, they want you to go in the back to meet him. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6537.5s)]
*  And he's just telling us stories and stories, [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6539.5s)]
*  he's like, you guys want to watch the wrestling? [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6541.5s)]
*  I was like, no, I was like, I want to hang out with you. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6543.5s)]
*  Yeah, dude, we got to hang out with Triple H, [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6545.5s)]
*  fucking Vince McMahon was there, all the wrestlers. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6547.5s)]
*  That guy impresses me. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6549.5s)]
*  Triple H or Ray Mysterio? [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6551.5s)]
*  Oh, Ray Mysterio. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6553.5s)]
*  He was like, whatever I need, he introduced me to everybody, [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6555.5s)]
*  if you want this, that, like, here, I'll bring you this guy. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6557.5s)]
*  Dude, he was so nice. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6559.5s)]
*  I think we're on our third Ray Mysterio by now, though. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6561.5s)]
*  We don't really know. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6563.5s)]
*  We don't really know. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6565.5s)]
*  He had his mask off and everything. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6567.5s)]
*  He was so cool. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6569.5s)]
*  It was actually like, he brought me back to my childhood. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6571.5s)]
*  Okay, nicest celebrity [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6573.5s)]
*  that you met, or the person that you met, [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6575.5s)]
*  and you're like, wow, you lived up to the expectation of you. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6577.5s)]
*  Logan Paul. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6579.5s)]
*  So Drake. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6581.5s)]
*  Conor. Conor is a fucking man. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6583.5s)]
*  I love Conor. Drake was fucking... [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6585.5s)]
*  Isn't it fucking nice when you admire somebody [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6587.5s)]
*  and then you meet them and you're like, I see [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6589.5s)]
*  why you are where you are. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6591.5s)]
*  But there's some people that you meet and you're like, [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6593.5s)]
*  it's hard fucking to come back. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6595.5s)]
*  Even as a guy who will always take shots at Drake, [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6597.5s)]
*  there's no question he belongs exactly where you are. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6599.5s)]
*  No, but have you ever talked to him? [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6601.5s)]
*  He's like the nicest dude ever. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6603.5s)]
*  He was like, yo, take my number if you ever want to [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6605.5s)]
*  go up and talk about shit. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6607.5s)]
*  He's awesome, you're so nice. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6609.5s)]
*  There's a really smart way to approach a guy like him. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6611.5s)]
*  You hang out in the city, you ever met Leo? [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6613.5s)]
*  No. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6615.5s)]
*  He's a very cool guy. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6617.5s)]
*  So that's the thing with these guys [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6619.5s)]
*  that have been famous since they're young. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6621.5s)]
*  He's what? I know him ten years. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6623.5s)]
*  But that's the other thing with these guys [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6625.5s)]
*  that are famous since they're young. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6627.5s)]
*  Leo's been famous since he's like 15 or 16 years old. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6629.5s)]
*  He's a little bit harder to... [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6631.5s)]
*  But you know, I give him respect because [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6633.5s)]
*  after my dad's funeral I took his two brothers out [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6635.5s)]
*  and I told him about it and I was like, oh, it's his two brothers. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6637.5s)]
*  And he was giving them shots and they were like [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6639.5s)]
*  obviously starting because they don't go out, they're older guys. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6641.5s)]
*  And they were having the best time of their life. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6643.5s)]
*  And he gave them a moment, [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6645.5s)]
*  which he didn't have to. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6647.5s)]
*  As who he is, obviously they're going to be [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6649.5s)]
*  going through what they're going through. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6651.5s)]
*  And he was giving them shots, he was like, I'm sorry about this. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6653.5s)]
*  And he was so nice. And I was like, [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6655.5s)]
*  any upcoming fighter I introduce him to, he always gives them the time. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6657.5s)]
*  He tells them about MMA. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6659.5s)]
*  He's a really, really good dude. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6661.5s)]
*  Really? He's awesome. We never met him? [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6663.5s)]
*  I love hearing stories about people. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6665.5s)]
*  Because it's... [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6667.5s)]
*  It is so easy [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6669.5s)]
*  to be nice to somebody, [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6671.5s)]
*  especially when you have a little bit more fame and clout. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6673.5s)]
*  Because the smallest thing [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6675.5s)]
*  means so much more. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6677.5s)]
*  So when people are famous and assholes... [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6679.5s)]
*  I think it's when you know someone [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6681.5s)]
*  that knows them and they kind of introduce you that they're a little bit more [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6683.5s)]
*  okay with it. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6685.5s)]
*  I think if you're just some random dude that... [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6687.5s)]
*  You're qualified. You're vetted. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6689.5s)]
*  You probably deal with that too, some random guy tries to be your... [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6691.5s)]
*  I try to make sure that that moment [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6693.5s)]
*  I am the nicest that I can be. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6695.5s)]
*  Especially if they come genuine. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6697.5s)]
*  They're coming up to me like, hey man, I love what you do. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6699.5s)]
*  I listen to you, I watch all your clips. That means a lot to me. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6701.5s)]
*  And that's the only reason why we have this. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6703.5s)]
*  I'm like that too. Someone's like, I'm a big fan of that. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6705.5s)]
*  You ever turn down a picture or anything? [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6707.5s)]
*  You know, [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6709.5s)]
*  I don't. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6711.5s)]
*  I actually don't, but sometimes [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6713.5s)]
*  where I'm not in a good mood and I'm walking into training [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6715.5s)]
*  or something, maybe I have. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6717.5s)]
*  But I try not to. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6719.5s)]
*  Because it makes them so happy. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6721.5s)]
*  And nowadays guys are freaking out like I'm fucking The Rock. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6723.5s)]
*  I can't let this guy down. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6725.5s)]
*  He's a grown ass man. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6727.5s)]
*  Screaming and fanboying. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6729.5s)]
*  Well that's the other thing, you know as a dude, it's a vulnerable thing [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6731.5s)]
*  to walk up to another dude and give him praise. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6733.5s)]
*  A lot of guys have ego. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6735.5s)]
*  But I remember being that guy. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6737.5s)]
*  And I'm still that guy for certain people. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6739.5s)]
*  If I met The Rock, I'd probably be like, [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6741.5s)]
*  I probably wouldn't be able to talk. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6743.5s)]
*  Dude, I idolized him growing up. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6745.5s)]
*  That's why I like him. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6747.5s)]
*  But Connor did with MMA. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6749.5s)]
*  I think The Rock did. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6751.5s)]
*  Well Stone Cold helped him. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6753.5s)]
*  I'm not saying that Stone Cold didn't also. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6755.5s)]
*  But the way that The Rock became [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6757.5s)]
*  larger than the sport. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6759.5s)]
*  Like, The Rock is now [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6761.5s)]
*  the biggest movie star. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6763.5s)]
*  There haven't been a lot of wrestlers that have done that. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6765.5s)]
*  I mean, the reason I talk so much is because of him. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6767.5s)]
*  Because I grew up watching him. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6769.5s)]
*  I probably wouldn't be how I am. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6771.5s)]
*  My banter and everything would [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6773.5s)]
*  be the same if I didn't watch him growing up. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6775.5s)]
*  He has such an influence on me. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6777.5s)]
*  From how old I was, [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6779.5s)]
*  for how many years watching him on TV, [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6781.5s)]
*  maybe, I don't know, I love that shit. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6783.5s)]
*  Did you get the book? Do you remember when he... [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6785.5s)]
*  I had everything. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6787.5s)]
*  I remember we lined up to go meet him. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6789.5s)]
*  He was signing his book at Tower. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6791.5s)]
*  This is how old I am. Tower Books. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6793.5s)]
*  Remember in the city, there was a place called Tower Records. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6795.5s)]
*  I went to go meet the Hardy Boys. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6797.5s)]
*  I waited in line for the Hardy Boys. I have a picture with Jeff Hardy. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6799.5s)]
*  I had the time, but I don't remember too much. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6801.5s)]
*  And why do you think that we're so drawn to [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6803.5s)]
*  wrestling figures? [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6805.5s)]
*  I think back then. Now these guys are cheesy as fuck. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6807.5s)]
*  I wouldn't say that. I think that there's guys like... [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6809.5s)]
*  The only guy now is L.A. Knight. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6811.5s)]
*  Back then there weren't that many guys that were outspoken [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6813.5s)]
*  and with the bravado. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6815.5s)]
*  L.A. Knight is the man. Now you guys watch? [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6817.5s)]
*  L.A. Knight, bro? He is the biggest pop... [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6819.5s)]
*  My laptop. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6821.5s)]
*  Jinder Mahal is my guy. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6823.5s)]
*  He's in NXT now. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6825.5s)]
*  That's my guy. NXT for life. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6827.5s)]
*  We liked wrestling back in the day because there really wasn't [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6829.5s)]
*  social media. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6831.5s)]
*  There wasn't that many people that just outwards... [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6833.5s)]
*  Can you play the sound because it's a YouTube video? [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6835.5s)]
*  And we didn't have as many entertainment options. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6837.5s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6839.5s)]
*  Do you guys want to fucking drink and chill? This is like a fucking hangout. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6841.5s)]
*  This is awesome. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6843.5s)]
*  I just feel like this is not all going to be... [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6845.5s)]
*  It's going to cut? [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6847.5s)]
*  You want to watch three hours of this? [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6849.5s)]
*  On the internet. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6851.5s)]
*  And then they'll get to know who you really are. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6853.5s)]
*  And you'll see the reactions. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6855.5s)]
*  Did you see fucking Joe's thing on me? [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6857.5s)]
*  It's actually the first thing that comes up. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6859.5s)]
*  Can you play the sound? [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6861.5s)]
*  It's my laptop. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6863.5s)]
*  Me and Joe were really close. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6865.5s)]
*  And then he doesn't have me on. It's messed up. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6867.5s)]
*  He didn't give me eight tickets front row to his fucking show at MSG. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6869.5s)]
*  Because he's the fucking man. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6871.5s)]
*  Eight tickets. That's a whore ass. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6873.5s)]
*  Eight is a big ass. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6875.5s)]
*  But he's not a striker. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6877.5s)]
*  He's an elite grappler. His grappling is fucking amazing. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6879.5s)]
*  He's really fucking good. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6881.5s)]
*  On the ground, he's sensational. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6883.5s)]
*  That kid has some fucking serious jiu-jitsu. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6885.5s)]
*  Feels good, huh? [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6887.5s)]
*  Buddy, I'm getting my ass handed to me in these prize picks. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6889.5s)]
*  0-3, baby. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6891.5s)]
*  That's what I'm talking about, bro. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6893.5s)]
*  Sing-Loc is broken. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6895.5s)]
*  What did we say? We said just do the opposite of what you do. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6897.5s)]
*  Yo, that is honestly the move. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6899.5s)]
*  So don't change anything. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6901.5s)]
*  I'm going to keep your Sing-Loc. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6903.5s)]
*  Yes, 100%. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6905.5s)]
*  And then the audience watching or listening right now should know that. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6907.5s)]
*  And then choose the opposite. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6909.5s)]
*  There's actually a great Seinfeld episode about this. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6911.5s)]
*  Don't bring up Seinfeld. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6913.5s)]
*  I hate to do this to you. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6915.5s)]
*  I'm going to do the opposite. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6917.5s)]
*  It's a great classic Seinfeld episode. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6919.5s)]
*  Give me damn picks right now. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6921.5s)]
*  I'm keeping the same ass locks I had as last week. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6923.5s)]
*  Travis Kelce and Justin Jefferson. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6925.5s)]
*  More or less than half of a touchdown. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6927.5s)]
*  Meaning if they get one touchdown. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6929.5s)]
*  I'm keeping it more. Both of them again. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6931.5s)]
*  I'm running it back. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6933.5s)]
*  I fucked up last week. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6935.5s)]
*  I don't know how Travis Kelce didn't catch one with Taylor Swift in New York. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6937.5s)]
*  Ryan Reynolds was there. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=6939.5s)]

*  How do you know this story? [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7583.5s)]
*  I saw it on Rogan I think. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7585.5s)]
*  I saw it on the show. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7587.5s)]
*  I was like, you're too funny. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7589.5s)]
*  Get out of here. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7591.5s)]
*  I think so. This might be bullshit. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7593.5s)]
*  All I know is that right now, Kill Tony clips are dominating YouTube. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7595.5s)]
*  And the show is perfect for long form and short form. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7597.5s)]
*  You can watch a minute of somebody and you can watch an hour and a half or however long. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7599.5s)]
*  Shane Grylls thing is funny as fuck. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7601.5s)]
*  He fucking murdered it. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7603.5s)]
*  Did you see the thing with Ric Flair on it? [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7605.5s)]
*  Bro. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7607.5s)]
*  He got uncomfortable. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7609.5s)]
*  I think they needed to explain to Ric what the show was. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7611.5s)]
*  He was like, I don't like this show. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7613.5s)]
*  I don't like to put people down. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7615.5s)]
*  It was really awkward. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7617.5s)]
*  I felt bad for him to be honest. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7619.5s)]
*  It looked really weird. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7621.5s)]
*  And then they were making jokes and he was like, I'm out of here. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7623.5s)]
*  I just think he didn't get the show. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7625.5s)]
*  He might not be all there. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7627.5s)]
*  I think he was like, I'm going to bed. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7629.5s)]
*  It seemed really weird. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7631.5s)]
*  It got to the point of must see television where people tune in the moment it drops. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7633.5s)]
*  That shit is. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7635.5s)]
*  It's so good. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7637.5s)]
*  And also David Lucas and Tony's banter. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7639.5s)]
*  What kind of show is this? [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7641.5s)]
*  What late night hosts used to have with their co-hosts. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7643.5s)]
*  This is that on ecstasy. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7649.5s)]
*  The late night hosts, they have to be kind of polite to the person they're doing banter with. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7651.5s)]
*  These motherfuckers are being savages. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7655.5s)]
*  Who cares about getting canceled? [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7657.5s)]
*  Just fucking say what you're going to say. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7659.5s)]
*  It's a joke. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7661.5s)]
*  It's awesome to see what they build. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7663.5s)]
*  Would you ever do skits stuff? [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7665.5s)]
*  Like SNL? [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7667.5s)]
*  Skits I think are awesome. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7669.5s)]
*  Would you ever be a cast member for SNL? [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7671.5s)]
*  Would I do SNL? [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7673.5s)]
*  I wouldn't want to be a cast member. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7675.5s)]
*  He has too many Asian accents out there. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7677.5s)]
*  Ah! [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7679.5s)]
*  I don't want to do the sketches on SNL. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7681.5s)]
*  I have no interest in that. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7683.5s)]
*  Zero. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7685.5s)]
*  Have they ever came to you? [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7687.5s)]
*  When I was young in my career I got asked to audition for SNL. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7689.5s)]
*  Now I'm just like, no. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7691.5s)]
*  I understand the show is like an institution in New York. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7693.5s)]
*  Thanks bro. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7695.5s)]
*  So there's like part of you that goes like, oh wow, hosting SNL. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7697.5s)]
*  That means a lot to us as New Yorkers. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7699.5s)]
*  But just being an actor on it, it's not something that interests me. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7701.5s)]
*  But Dylan, you got to do stand up bro. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7703.5s)]
*  Fuck that. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7705.5s)]
*  Just like we're still fighting bro. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7707.5s)]
*  Scared? [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7709.5s)]
*  Really? [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7711.5s)]
*  Because no one laughs. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7713.5s)]
*  What do you do? [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7715.5s)]
*  You learn how to cope with that. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7717.5s)]
*  Especially me. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7719.5s)]
*  It wouldn't be like some up and comer that gets roasted. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7721.5s)]
*  It would be like Dylan Danis gets fucking annihilated. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7723.5s)]
*  You would have to deal with the repercussions of bombing. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7725.5s)]
*  That's hard. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7727.5s)]
*  You gonna write my jokes? [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7729.5s)]
*  I would help you if you wanted to do a minute, I would help you. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7731.5s)]
*  Do you write jokes? [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7733.5s)]
*  Like for other people? [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7735.5s)]
*  No. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7737.5s)]
*  I would do it for you like we could work on something funny. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7739.5s)]
*  You didn't give me any lines, you gave Logan all his lines. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7741.5s)]
*  When he did the monologue. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7743.5s)]
*  No, I never gave Logan lines. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7745.5s)]
*  He was like, what do you mean? [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7747.5s)]
*  What's bad about getting lines? [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7749.5s)]
*  I was like, Andrew Schultz writes all your shit. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7751.5s)]
*  No, I didn't write anything for him. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7753.5s)]
*  I didn't write anything for him. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7755.5s)]
*  When he did the monologue here on the show, of course. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7757.5s)]
*  But like when he's doing yours, no. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7759.5s)]
*  Again, you have to understand. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7761.5s)]
*  I told Logan the same thing that I told you. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7763.5s)]
*  But you're closer with him, right? [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7765.5s)]
*  I'm closer with him probably than I'm closer with you. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7767.5s)]
*  But like we still talk. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7769.5s)]
*  I told Logan that too. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7771.5s)]
*  And I said, listen, what I want to do is I want you both to make the most money on this fight. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7773.5s)]
*  At this point I didn't know that you weren't getting a piece. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7775.5s)]
*  So I told him, I was like, listen, [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7777.5s)]
*  I want to have you on and I want to have Dylan on. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7779.5s)]
*  We've been trying to get you on for fucking... [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7781.5s)]
*  Stop it. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7783.5s)]
*  Are you going to cap right now? [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7785.5s)]
*  You're hard to deal with. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7787.5s)]
*  You big dick me all the time. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7789.5s)]
*  Are you going to cap right now? [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7791.5s)]
*  For the KSI fight, you were like, no, no, no, you're not going to fight. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7793.5s)]
*  Did you fight? [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7795.5s)]
*  I asked you to come on. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7797.5s)]
*  Did you fight? [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7799.5s)]
*  Yes. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7801.5s)]
*  I asked you to come on after Logan. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7803.5s)]
*  You were like, you're not going to fight. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7805.5s)]
*  No, I didn't say that. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7807.5s)]
*  I said, are you really going to fight? [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7809.5s)]
*  I don't care about the numbers. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7811.5s)]
*  What I care about is the fact that you... [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7813.5s)]
*  Don't back him up. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7815.5s)]
*  Someone have my back. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7817.5s)]
*  What's most important is... [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7819.5s)]
*  I just got hooked up with a porn star. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7821.5s)]
*  I didn't pull through. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7823.5s)]
*  Which one? [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7825.5s)]
*  Shorty we had way back in the day. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7827.5s)]
*  No, was it... [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7829.5s)]
*  We got to hook you up with Daisy. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7831.5s)]
*  We got you with Daisy. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7833.5s)]
*  Listen, don't do it. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7835.5s)]
*  Listen. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7837.5s)]
*  And I told her, I'm like, yo, she's charging. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7839.5s)]
*  I was like, what you want to do? [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7841.5s)]
*  Would you fuck Hulk Hogan with the... [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7843.5s)]
*  What? [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7845.5s)]
*  The answer is yes. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7847.5s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7849.5s)]
*  Would you fuck Hulk Hogan with the pussy [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7851.5s)]
*  or would you fuck Megan Fox with the dick? [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7853.5s)]
*  This is actually a fantastic hypothetical. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7855.5s)]
*  All time hypothetical. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7857.5s)]
*  Head? [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7859.5s)]
*  Head is different. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7861.5s)]
*  Let's do head because fuck is different. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7863.5s)]
*  No, fuck. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7865.5s)]
*  So you're going to fuck Hulk Hogan? [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7867.5s)]
*  You're a fucking asshole. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7869.5s)]
*  Let's do head because head is where everybody [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7871.5s)]
*  really gets on board. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7873.5s)]
*  Okay, well Megan Fox's face, obviously you're going to go with Megan Fox. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7875.5s)]
*  That's what I'm talking about, my boy. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7877.5s)]
*  Just answer the question. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7879.5s)]
*  So you would take head from a trans woman [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7881.5s)]
*  over a woman with a beard. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7883.5s)]
*  Hulk Hogan with a beard? [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7885.5s)]
*  Head, just head. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7887.5s)]
*  What would you do? Fuck, that's disgusting. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7889.5s)]
*  That is the most progressive thing you've ever said. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7893.5s)]
*  But the thing is, I'm attracted to women. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7895.5s)]
*  If you look like a woman and you're just getting dome, whatever. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7897.5s)]
*  Yeah, but Hulk Hogan, even though he has a pussy... [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7901.5s)]
*  Pussy with that handlebar mustache? [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7903.5s)]
*  So what would you do? [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7905.5s)]
*  You got to get the top. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7907.5s)]
*  No, but you have to fuck. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7909.5s)]
*  But now let's switch it if you have to fuck. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7911.5s)]
*  I'll bust Hulk Hogan down. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7913.5s)]
*  I'll bust him down one handle. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7915.5s)]
*  What would you do? [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7917.5s)]
*  Well, you don't have to worry about Hulk Hogan, I don't think. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7919.5s)]
*  I don't think Hulk wants much to do with it. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7921.5s)]
*  See, see, see, he said mega fuck. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7923.5s)]
*  I asked him to hook me up with a porn star, he didn't pull through. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7925.5s)]
*  I tried, but I told you. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7927.5s)]
*  Oh, Lisa Ann didn't want to... [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7929.5s)]
*  No, he tried. You didn't want to pay. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7931.5s)]
*  Oh, I had to pay? Yes. How much? [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7933.5s)]
*  I'll pay that, I got money. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7935.5s)]
*  Yes, I did. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7939.5s)]
*  I paid for that. For one night? [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7941.5s)]
*  I told you that. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7943.5s)]
*  He hit him with a purse. He did not say this. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7945.5s)]
*  We're talking crazy right now. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7947.5s)]
*  He's trying to distract from the fact [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7949.5s)]
*  that we asked him to come on a while ago and he didn't come on. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7951.5s)]
*  Now you had legit reason... [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7953.5s)]
*  I would do that price. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7955.5s)]
*  Don't let him distract. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7957.5s)]
*  You had legit reason [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7959.5s)]
*  to fail. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7961.5s)]
*  What? [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7963.5s)]
*  Your family stuff going on. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7965.5s)]
*  So that's why I was like, whatever. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7967.5s)]
*  Totally cool. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7969.5s)]
*  But then after I said I'm going to fight Logan, [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7971.5s)]
*  and I said, come on. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7973.5s)]
*  No, I'm talking post Logan. The second it was announced. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7975.5s)]
*  And then you told me the... [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7977.5s)]
*  I was like, yeah, whatever. That's priority. You handle that. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7979.5s)]
*  Obviously. And then... [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7981.5s)]
*  some other little fucking gay shit. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7983.5s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7985.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7987.5s)]
*  Isn't there something? [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7989.5s)]
*  Between me and you? [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7991.5s)]
*  I'm not my type, bro. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7993.5s)]
*  Should we act out a scene? [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7995.5s)]
*  I'm going to get ropes in. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7997.5s)]
*  I want to know the second time what happened. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=7999.5s)]
*  What did? [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8001.5s)]
*  Wasn't there two times he was supposed to come on? [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8003.5s)]
*  I think it was twice. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8005.5s)]
*  There was two times he was supposed to come on. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8007.5s)]
*  He canceled on this guy. He put him in his place. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8009.5s)]
*  This guy's an animal. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8011.5s)]
*  This guy's an absolute animal. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8013.5s)]

*  We must be boys, bro. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8021.5s)]

*  He gave permission. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8035.5s)]
*  What about the fucking Ariel Hwanimi? [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8037.5s)]
*  I thought you and Ariel have a great banter. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8039.5s)]
*  Are you going to go hard on me? [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8041.5s)]
*  No. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8043.5s)]
*  No, I'm saying he's been nice. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8045.5s)]
*  What I'm saying is we like you. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8047.5s)]
*  You know I love you. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8049.5s)]
*  You're my guy. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8051.5s)]
*  He's my favorite, but you're my second. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8053.5s)]
*  Have you paid for pussy before? [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8055.5s)]
*  Of course. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8057.5s)]
*  What country? [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8059.5s)]
*  I never paid for pussy, but I think I got it. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8061.5s)]
*  Shut up. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8063.5s)]
*  I have actually. [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8065.5s)]
*  Thank you for getting a rubbing tug. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8067.5s)]
*  Who forgets? [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8069.5s)]
*  Who hasn't paid for pussy before? [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8071.5s)]
*  I'm going to get fucking roasted for this. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8073.5s)]
*  Why is that roast? [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8075.5s)]
*  Because I'm already down with the girls. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8077.5s)]
*  This is not helping my cause. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8079.5s)]
*  They're all fucking against me right now. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8081.5s)]
*  Why are they against you? [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8083.5s)]
*  I'm never going to get a fucking girlfriend again. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8085.5s)]
*  Because I'm a fucking massager. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8087.5s)]
*  This is bullying a girl. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8089.5s)]
*  I'm going to get a fucking pussy now. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8091.5s)]
*  You're going to win over all the sex workers. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8093.5s)]
*  I'm supporting an independent business woman. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8095.5s)]
*  That's all that is. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8097.5s)]
*  You'll win them back over because they were upset at you. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8099.5s)]
*  Did you see Logan saying with the three slum I had a lead in the girl who said she stuck a finger in my ass? [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8101.5s)]
*  That shit was fire, right? [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8105.5s)]
*  No, she tried. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8107.5s)]
*  I don't mind a finger in the ass. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8109.5s)]
*  I'm getting head like a fucking finger in the ass is not my favorite thing. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8111.5s)]
*  But if she gets down there. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8115.5s)]
*  I'm not on all fours like fucking you know what I mean. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8117.5s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8119.5s)]
*  I don't know if it's funny that he posted that. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8121.5s)]
*  But playing with the ass feels fun. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8123.5s)]
*  I mean girl you might as well say no. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8125.5s)]
*  No, here's the thing. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8127.5s)]
*  I was scared to fucking let a girl do it because I was like I don't know if I want to like it. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8129.5s)]
*  I said that I was like I'm not prepared for this. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8131.5s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not prepared for it afterwards. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8133.5s)]
*  The threesome was great though for my birthday. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8135.5s)]
*  It was a birthday gift? [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8137.5s)]
*  Was it you, her and her finger? [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8139.5s)]
*  It was her and another girl that I wanted to bang and then her. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8141.5s)]
*  And I got just. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8143.5s)]
*  Use condoms or no? [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8145.5s)]
*  Dude, you're never going to get me laid again bro. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8147.5s)]
*  Why? [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8149.5s)]
*  You think you're the first guy who would end up protected sex? [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8151.5s)]
*  No, it's not that. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8153.5s)]
*  At least once. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8155.5s)]
*  Yeah, I used protection. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8157.5s)]
*  You did use protection. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8159.5s)]
*  Do you switch the protection for the girls or do they just submit to the same protection? [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8161.5s)]
*  No, we all had STD checks. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8163.5s)]
*  That's how that worked actually. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8165.5s)]
*  These only faggurls got their fucking paperwork on them when they got there. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8167.5s)]
*  Oh shit, I guess you could claim defamation for the STD thing. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8169.5s)]
*  You have to take an STD test. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8171.5s)]
*  We could sue back and forth. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8173.5s)]
*  Interesting, but you don't have any STDs. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8175.5s)]
*  Well, not now. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8177.5s)]
*  Donnery. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8179.5s)]
*  I'm joking. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8181.5s)]
*  You never had to clap or anything? [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8183.5s)]
*  I actually never have. I thought I did. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8185.5s)]
*  One of the coolest things I've ever done. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8187.5s)]
*  My favorite porn star growing up. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8189.5s)]
*  I fucked her. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8191.5s)]
*  This is the rock. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8193.5s)]
*  Who, who, who? Can you say a name? [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8195.5s)]
*  She was my favorite porn star growing up as a kid. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8197.5s)]
*  She lived up to the hype? [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8199.5s)]
*  It was amazing. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8201.5s)]
*  I mean, you go to the girl, but I don't want to, because I don't want to fraud the girls. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8203.5s)]
*  Porn hoes. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=8205.5s)]

*  I didn't want to get canceled, so I hesitated. [[02:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10658.42s)]
*  But if I did one head kick, it would be over. [[02:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10660.42s)]

*  And I won't say what he said about it. [[02:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10776.42s)]
*  We talked about it though. [[02:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10778.42s)]
*  Where's the mic? [[02:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10780.42s)]
*  We did talk about it. [[02:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10782.42s)]
*  Okay, so speaking of Nina, she sued you. [[02:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10784.42s)]

*  So speaking of Nina, [[02:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10798.42s)]
*  you're from Jersey. [[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10800.42s)]
*  You're from Jersey. [[03:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10802.42s)]
*  You're drinking a lime flavored soda. [[03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10804.42s)]
*  You took eight minutes to sit there and think of a joke. [[03:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10806.42s)]
*  I was catching my breath. [[03:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10808.42s)]
*  Let me talk to him. [[03:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10810.42s)]
*  I was catching my breath. [[03:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10812.42s)]
*  Stop saying that because you know that she had to go through him. [[03:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10814.42s)]
*  Okay. [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10816.42s)]
*  Just like if my mom wants to sue him, [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10818.42s)]
*  she's going to come to me and say, [[03:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10820.42s)]
*  listen, I'm going to say no, I'm going to go break that man's fucking face. [[03:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10822.42s)]
*  Understand. [[03:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10824.42s)]
*  Okay, so stop saying it's her. It's him. [[03:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10826.42s)]
*  If I was him, I would tell her, [[03:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10828.42s)]
*  please don't do that. [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10830.42s)]
*  Exactly. [[03:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10832.42s)]
*  But guys like Schultz, they don't wear the pants. [[03:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10834.42s)]
*  I just took your pants off right now. [[03:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10836.42s)]
*  Just ignore him. [[03:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10838.42s)]
*  I just took your pants off. [[03:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10840.42s)]
*  I spread those fucking Armenian cheeks. [[03:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10842.42s)]
*  I slit a finger in there. [[03:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10844.42s)]
*  So nice. [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10846.42s)]
*  How do you deal with this guy all day long? [[03:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10848.42s)]
*  What do you mean? Why won't you give me your energy? [[03:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10850.42s)]
*  So you sort of post Logan put out [[03:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10852.42s)]
*  with like the whole Matrix shit. [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10854.42s)]
*  And it looks like a lose-lose for you either way. [[03:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10856.42s)]
*  So like what's the upside? [[03:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10858.42s)]
*  Don't be nervous, bro. I'm just here. [[03:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10860.42s)]
*  What's the upside? [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10862.42s)]
*  That's why I'm a chale and everybody's saying just pull out. [[03:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10864.42s)]
*  Like what the fuck am I doing? [[03:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10866.42s)]
*  I'm just making money for the big guy. [[03:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10868.42s)]
*  Hold my hand. [[03:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10870.42s)]
*  Why don't you pull out? [[03:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10872.42s)]
*  There's no upside for you. [[03:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10874.42s)]
*  Go webbing. [[03:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10876.42s)]
*  And I feel bad because you did all the work [[03:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10878.42s)]
*  to big up this fight. [[03:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10880.42s)]
*  Now you know how I feel. You just explain how I feel. [[03:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10882.42s)]
*  So I'm in a tough situation because if I pull out, [[03:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10884.42s)]
*  I look like, oh, I don't want to fight. [[03:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10886.42s)]
*  But like there is no upside. [[03:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10888.42s)]
*  I think enough people can understand if you pull out [[03:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10890.42s)]
*  because no one has ever sued [[03:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10892.42s)]
*  just because they promoted the fight that well. [[03:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10894.42s)]
*  At Vanderhoof, they ensued Mike Tyson [[03:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10896.42s)]
*  for fighting his hero. [[03:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10898.42s)]
*  And fucking Mike Tyson said, I'll fucking eat your kids. [[03:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10900.42s)]
*  He said I'm gonna feel. [[03:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10902.42s)]
*  So that's what I'm saying. [[03:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10904.42s)]
*  Some people will fault you, but not everyone will fault you [[03:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10906.42s)]
*  if you pull out. But at the same time, [[03:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10908.42s)]
*  you are, [[03:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10910.42s)]
*  you're gonna feel lesser than if you pull out [[03:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10912.42s)]
*  and then he can talk shit. [[03:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10914.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10916.42s)]
*  So what are you gonna do? [[03:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10918.42s)]
*  What's the up? [[03:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10920.42s)]
*  I'm tired. [[03:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10922.42s)]
*  Okay, but what's the gameplay after? [[03:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10924.42s)]
*  Fight MMA. Do what I do. [[03:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10926.42s)]
*  Tap someone out in 20 seconds. [[03:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10928.42s)]
*  I'm ready to go MMA now. [[03:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10930.42s)]
*  So there's really no upside. Like you're in a tough fucking situation. [[03:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10932.42s)]
*  You're the first person to ever explain it, [[03:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10934.42s)]
*  how I feel. [[03:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10936.42s)]
*  No, but people see it. People understand. [[03:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10938.42s)]
*  He's like, lost two losses. [[03:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10940.42s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[03:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10942.42s)]
*  Everybody believes that the lawsuit thing is fucked up. [[03:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10944.42s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait. [[03:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10946.42s)]
*  At the same time, at the same time, [[03:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10948.42s)]
*  you put yourself in this situation. [[03:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10950.42s)]
*  You put yourself in this situation. [[03:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10952.42s)]
*  You went way too hard for them to even have the ammunition to put you in a lawsuit. [[03:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10954.42s)]
*  But the lawsuit is corny and I think that the public believes it's corny. [[03:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10958.42s)]
*  But why did Logan pick me? [[03:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10960.42s)]
*  I've never heard anybody support the lawsuit, publicly. Have you? [[03:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10962.42s)]
*  No, no one. [[03:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10964.42s)]
*  Even the MMA community is like, yo, we don't do this shit. [[03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10966.42s)]
*  Everybody's like, yo, we don't want to claim you as a fighter, boxer, whatever the fuck you want. [[03:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10968.42s)]
*  You're rude. [[03:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10970.42s)]
*  He's setting a bad precedent for fighters going forward. [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10972.42s)]
*  Because now, okay, [[03:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10974.42s)]
*  shit talking. I say you're a fucking, [[03:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10976.42s)]
*  oh no, you have gonorrhea. Now you sue me. [[03:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10978.42s)]
*  Yeah, but he's not a fighter. [[03:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10980.42s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. But he pretends he is. [[03:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10982.42s)]
*  So it's like, what the fuck are we doing here? [[03:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10984.42s)]
*  You're not a fucking fighter. You're fucking suing. [[03:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10986.42s)]
*  You're doing all these lawsuits and bullshit. [[03:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10988.42s)]
*  What's fucking fight? What is this, bro? [[03:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10990.42s)]
*  Just make sure you get what I tapped about. [[03:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=10992.42s)]

*  soft boys. [[03:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11008.42s)]
*  How you gonna send your shooters after Mike? [[03:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11010.42s)]
*  That's corny. No, that wasn't... [[03:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11012.42s)]
*  That's corny. That's mad corny. [[03:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11014.42s)]
*  Listen, that story was [[03:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11016.42s)]
*  fabricated and I don't want to go down. You said the story. [[03:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11018.42s)]
*  What do you mean? I never said about Mike. [[03:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11020.42s)]
*  Mike was never involved in that. [[03:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11022.42s)]
*  Mike just tried to step up. And that's what happens. [[03:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11024.42s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[03:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11026.42s)]
*  Do you want to talk about that or not? [[03:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11028.42s)]
*  You don't because I be out here. [[03:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11030.42s)]

*  Let me give him my fight. He's like, I heard you be outside. [[03:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11040.42s)]
*  No, I heard you be outside. [[03:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11042.42s)]
*  Being outside is different than running New York, though. [[03:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11044.42s)]
*  Yeah, that is a big difference. [[03:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11046.42s)]
*  Nobody got to check in with you. [[03:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11048.42s)]
*  You want to bet? Nobody got to check in with you. [[03:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11050.42s)]
*  When you walked in and you checked in. [[03:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11052.42s)]
*  When I walked in before you had to check in. [[03:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11054.42s)]
*  With those fucking paint and paint as he came over and checked in. [[03:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11056.42s)]
*  That was a rough sense. [[03:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11058.42s)]
*  I'll try again. [[03:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11060.42s)]

*  No, it's fake, bro. [[03:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11094.42s)]
*  He took snippets of it. [[03:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11096.42s)]
*  I get pushed in the head for a living. I stutter a little bit. [[03:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11098.42s)]
*  Those snippets weren't real. [[03:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11100.42s)]
*  If you watched the whole thing, it wasn't like he would have that loud sound. [[03:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11102.42s)]
*  Every little time. [[03:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11104.42s)]
*  The thing with Logan, he's trained by WWE every single weekend. [[03:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11106.42s)]
*  To be on the mic. He's on SmackDown. [[03:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11108.42s)]

*  He does. [[03:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11112.42s)]
*  You can't complain about the edit. [[03:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11114.42s)]
*  You're good with the social media. [[03:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11116.42s)]
*  I'm just saying it's not real, though. [[03:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11118.42s)]
*  I mean, it is real. [[03:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11120.42s)]
*  You made those mistakes. [[03:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11122.42s)]
*  So if you took every single time all of us messed up and put it in one clip and made it look like it was 30 seconds. [[03:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11124.42s)]
*  It would still be real. [[03:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11126.42s)]

*  I don't have that many jokes. I'm not like you guys. [[03:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11500.42s)]
*  I sit at home and write jokes all day. [[03:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11502.42s)]
*  We're not a comedian. [[03:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11504.42s)]
*  Just describe our jobs. [[03:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11506.42s)]
*  When did you bring them on? [[03:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11508.42s)]
*  How did that work? [[03:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11510.42s)]
*  I just found some people that are incredibly talented. [[03:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11512.42s)]
*  Before they used to be the guys on the side. [[03:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11514.42s)]
*  They were so talented that they needed to be on the chair. [[03:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11516.42s)]
*  Haven't you felt that way today? [[03:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11518.42s)]
*  I want to make sure my friends get all the shine that they can get. [[03:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11520.42s)]
*  You're like me. [[03:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11522.42s)]
*  Because everybody fucking... We all eat. [[03:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11524.42s)]
*  Some of us eat later. [[03:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11526.42s)]
*  That's the fact. [[03:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11528.42s)]
*  I'm so mad. [[03:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11530.42s)]
*  I'm saying it's the second course and third course. [[03:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11534.42s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with that, by the way. [[03:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11540.42s)]
*  Stop looking at me. [[03:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11542.42s)]
*  I'm not just saying there's nothing wrong with it. [[03:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11544.42s)]
*  Nobody knows who we're looking at. [[03:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11546.42s)]
*  You got the wrong friend. [[03:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11548.42s)]
*  I'm just saying we all call it dessert. [[03:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11550.42s)]
*  It's alright, baby. [[03:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11552.42s)]
*  Listen, guys, Dylan... [[03:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11554.42s)]
*  I have so many more stories, but this has been how long? [[03:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11556.42s)]
*  I can go forever. [[03:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11558.42s)]
*  I think we're at four almost. [[03:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11560.42s)]
*  Hold on one second. [[03:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11562.42s)]
*  Let's just talk. [[03:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11564.42s)]
*  Hold on one second. Let me see. How long are we at, Miles? [[03:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11566.42s)]
*  Let me check my phone. I got like girls... [[03:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11568.42s)]
*  Oh shit, we have to wrap up this podcast. [[03:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11570.42s)]
*  Why? What do you got to do? You got nowhere to go. [[03:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11572.42s)]
*  Because I have responsibilities, too. [[03:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11574.42s)]
*  We have people who love us. [[03:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11576.42s)]
*  That was just mean. [[03:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11578.42s)]
*  That was a mean joke. [[03:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11580.42s)]
*  I was going to let you know what's happening. [[03:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11582.42s)]
*  Nah, they love you. [[03:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11584.42s)]
*  You love them, right? [[03:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11586.42s)]
*  They love them. [[03:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11588.42s)]
*  But that's a joke, then. [[03:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11590.42s)]
*  It's a joke. If they love you, it's a joke. [[03:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11592.42s)]
*  Because you can't see things that are not true. [[03:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11594.42s)]
*  Are you being sensitive again? [[03:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11596.42s)]
*  Have we not shown you enough love? [[03:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11598.42s)]

*  And we love you, bro. [[03:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11610.42s)]
*  I'm going to knock you out. [[03:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11612.42s)]
*  Hey, you're going to accept some love. [[03:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11614.42s)]
*  I don't want it. [[03:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11616.42s)]
*  You know what? [[03:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11618.42s)]

*  Hey, hey, hey, hey. [[03:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11626.42s)]
*  What if you're on his hug now? [[03:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11628.42s)]
*  You're entertaining, and you've got courage to get there in the fucking ring. [[03:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11630.42s)]
*  Don't do anything with that. [[03:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11636.42s)]
*  That's a good, honest handshake. [[03:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11638.42s)]
*  Don't do anything with that. [[03:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11640.42s)]
*  Tell the crowd that I am entertaining. [[03:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11642.42s)]
*  I know, but that was fake. [[03:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11644.42s)]
*  It wasn't. [[03:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11646.42s)]
*  People are like, he's monotone, this and that. [[03:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11648.42s)]

*  We just gave it up to you. [[03:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11652.42s)]
*  I know, but you can't tell when he's serious, this fucker. [[03:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11654.42s)]
*  He's looking at me with this shitty acting face. [[03:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11656.42s)]
*  And I can't fucking figure it out. [[03:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11658.42s)]

*  I'm a little dehydrated. [[03:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11666.42s)]
*  He's okay. [[03:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11668.42s)]
*  I've been mopping the floor with you and Jiu Jitsu for the last hour. [[03:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11670.42s)]
*  Obviously, it's taking it out on me. [[03:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11672.42s)]
*  I've never done Jiu Jitsu in person. [[03:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11674.42s)]
*  I didn't realize that was so fucking good. [[03:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11676.42s)]
*  I just can't tell if he's being serious. [[03:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11678.42s)]
*  I can tell when he's being serious. [[03:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11680.42s)]
*  I feel like you're a little bit more timid this time. [[03:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11682.42s)]
*  The first time I pushed on you a little bit. [[03:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11684.42s)]
*  But it was only us three, so I needed to... [[03:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11686.42s)]
*  You know how entertainment and comedy goes. [[03:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11688.42s)]

*  What the fuck was this fucking combined bullshit? [[03:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11708.42s)]

*  Can I come on the show and be the fifth guest? [[03:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11714.42s)]
*  Whenever you want. [[03:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11716.42s)]
*  Don't bullshit me, because when I ask you to come on... [[03:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11718.42s)]
*  And I mean that because I don't think... [[03:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11720.42s)]
*  You know what's fucked up? [[03:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11722.42s)]
*  I think because he said that certain people don't riff with him. [[03:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvDD1oNoxQ&t=11724.42s)]
