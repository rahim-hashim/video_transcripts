# Epstein List Gets Roasted, Katt Williams Breaks Internet, & Jo Koy vs Golden Globes
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [January 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY)
*  Jeff and Elaine the traffic king and queen are back, baby. The much anticipated Epstein file has dropped [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=0.0s)]
*  It's 1000 pages only cat Williams can read that fast [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=7.66s)]
*  So here are the hits turns out the Epstein Island conspiracy is some fresh blood and no [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=11.700000000000001s)]
*  I'm not talking about Heimans human hot wheels Stephen Hawking got rolled into this kid diddling debacle [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=16.86s)]
*  Hawking who apparently loves strip clubs and looked like he got a lap dance from a wrecking ball [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=23.76s)]
*  visited Epstein's Island for an academic conference in [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=29.580000000000002s)]
*  2006 where he was rumored to have an underage orgy or as he calls it the gangbang theory [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=33.86s)]
*  Epstein tried to pay people to discredit the rumor and cover up Hawking's tire tracks [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=39.300000000000004s)]
*  They even tried to erase Stephen's memory by shaking him like an Etch A Sketch [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=44.260000000000005s)]
*  Hawking wasn't the only new name revealed voice actor for a cartoon dirt bike [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=48.38s)]
*  Rfk jr. Was on the list he immediately blamed his ex-wife for being on Epstein's plane and at his house [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=54.22s)]
*  Finally a Kennedy that knows how to use his wife for cover [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=61.42s)]
*  Honestly, though does the CIA kill everyone this guy knows look I just hope he wasn't at the Stephen Hawking orgy [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=64.98s)]
*  Okay, the Kennedys have seen enough brain splatter [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=72.46000000000001s)]
*  Think about it David Copperfield also was allegedly at Epstein's house because when there's kids to entertain you [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=76.1s)]
*  Hire a magician they actually asked Copperfield if he wanted a 26 year old to which he responded in true magician fashion [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=83.82000000000001s)]
*  Let's cut that in half aside from those guys [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=91.58s)]
*  It's just the same cast of characters that deserve to take a submarine trip to the Titanic Bill Clinton was mentioned [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=94.42s)]
*  But the worst thing they said about Bill and the whole drop is he likes him young [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=101.18s)]
*  I mean this guy is slipperier than Stephen Hawking's chin as of now the only miners that we know for sure [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=105.08s)]
*  Clinton fucked were the ones digging out of the rubble in Haiti and you can't mention Epstein without his favorite royal kid [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=112.38000000000001s)]
*  Rinser Prince Andrew. I mean, how is this guy not in jail? Oh, yeah. He's a fucking prince [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=119.68s)]
*  I can't believe England pays for this guy to fly around the world and fuck teens at least in America [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  We elect people to fly around the world and fuck teens the royal family claims that what Prince Andrew is doing is not [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=131.3s)]
*  Grooming it's air conditioning now that joke is confusing try spelling air [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=139.82s)]
*  Heir ultimately this drop was more useless than Stephen Hawking's Fitbit [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=145.98000000000002s)]
*  The allegations are so old Clinton wouldn't stuff his cock in him. Hopefully more information comes out [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=150.9s)]
*  Hopefully justice is served and hopefully Epstein and Ghislaine or gis Lane or whoever the hell you pronounce her name [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=157.98000000000002s)]
*  Hopefully they both rot in hell. I mean that would be a massage with a happy ending now, let's start this show [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  All right. So how y'all how y'all feel about? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  The Hawk how you feel about the whole dude young hockey. Yo young Hawking. Oh, the hockey talk. Yeah [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=174.2s)]
*  What do you guys think about this so I when I first saw the thing that he was watching midgets do [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=182.44s)]
*  Equations on the board. Oh, yeah, I was so excited. Yeah, that was the best [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=187.92s)]
*  That was a Twitter setup, yeah, not real. Yeah, not real at all. But yeah, what was the allegation? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=192.16s)]
*  I really wanted to believe yeah [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=198.04000000000002s)]
*  So the allegation was that he used to watch midgets naked midgets do algebra problems on a chalkboard [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=200.12s)]
*  That was too high which not illegal. Yeah, not illegal [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=205.8s)]
*  Yeah, such a good lie [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=212.16s)]
*  Stephen Hawking has become more likable through [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=214.4s)]
*  The idea that he was on this island somehow like rolling around in the sand [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=217.28s)]
*  Yeah, not wheelchair accessible, but he figured it out. Yeah taking place in these like underage orgies. It's like [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=221.76000000000002s)]
*  Which is wrong, but there's no way that he could communicate. He wanted it [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=227.6s)]
*  Like he could be like I was a computer [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  They were typing shit in like I got he got hacked by a pedophile pedophile [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=237.8s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein was on the fucking on the keyboard. I was disgusted. You can see it on my face. This poor fucking [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=242.16000000000003s)]
*  Fortunately I had to do it. Yo, my AI wanted to get crazy [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=249.84s)]
*  That being said he has a little reputation of being a wild boy cheating on your wife [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=253.28s)]
*  While you're that crippled was he that crippled the time he cheated. Yo, maybe he was son [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=257.76s)]
*  Okay [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=262.88s)]
*  Low-key like we always put on Stephen Hawking because we hate men. Yeah, do you know me because women hate men? Yeah exactly [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=264.08s)]
*  We're living in a matriarchy [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=272.8s)]
*  Immediately assume a man who is crippled and can't even move his eyebrows [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=274.84s)]
*  Yeah, he literally communicates with blinking. Mm-hmm that he has the capability to not only have sex with another woman seduce another woman [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=277.52s)]
*  No, he can't give consent. He literally can't come on. He literally can't yeah [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=286.0s)]
*  This motherfucker been getting raped. They've been rolling him around the world from rape to rape. He's been trafficked [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=291.68s)]
*  He is the traffic [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=298.96s)]
*  He's the traffic he needs an apology for Virginia Gouffre [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=301.59999999999997s)]
*  From soyberg or whoever the other girl he needs an apology for every girl on that list [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=306.96s)]
*  Why'd y'all diddle Stephen Hawking? He didn't want to fuck y'all. He want to do science experiments [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=311.0s)]
*  That's all he wants and they roll him into the strip club this mutant [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=315.03999999999996s)]
*  And forcing him to do this shit that you don't even want to do in cargo probably in you know [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=320.12s)]
*  I can't waste him first class. We put him in the overhead [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=324.76s)]
*  Under the sea in front of me. We got a good hit list [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=328.04s)]
*  And he was in for a while me how old did he get [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  So what do you mean? How old did he live to like usually they go sooner if you got that if you got fold them up into? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=338.24s)]
*  luggage disease [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=344.28000000000003s)]
*  Then they usually go if you get way back syndrome you do get you do that [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=345.44s)]
*  He does fold up [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=349.72s)]
*  76 he went to 76. No fucking yeah. Oh, that's a good 76 right there [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=352.48s)]
*  Anyway, my point is I think that I think that Stephen Hawking deserves an apology one from Twitter. Mm-hmm, right? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=358.72s)]
*  Assuming that he would want to do something so silly as to watch midges do math problems on a chalkboard [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=365.12s)]
*  It was too high for them on their tippy toes [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=369.32s)]
*  The midges probably too high for him also also midges on a tippy toes is mad funny [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=371.64s)]
*  You saw the raccoons trying to open the open the door no, man, this is far [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=382.24s)]
*  I love all the people that just sent me midget shit, bro [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=386.56s)]
*  Well, you know that's your shit now. They know you to midgets now [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=389.0s)]
*  They're just funny people [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=392.76s)]
*  I mean they are a funny group of people and now they're leaning into it, too [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=395.36s)]
*  So it's like now they're like making tick tocks and shit. Oh, come on now [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=399.52s)]
*  Come on now, I think I don't know this is a [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=407.59999999999997s)]
*  artistic interpretation [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=411.36s)]
*  Not a means for the Stephen Hawkins has been crazy. Isn't it wild? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=413.24s)]
*  Like it's something is absolutely violent disgusting as a you know sexual assault and if you add Stephen Hawking into it [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=416.15999999999997s)]
*  There is some levity. Yeah, it comes real funny. It's not funny. No, it's not funny what them girls did to him [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=423.96000000000004s)]
*  It's not funny. Yeah, it's disgusting what they fucking do. I believe in victims [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=430.76000000000005s)]
*  I mean, it's disgusting what happened to those girls with other guys. Yeah, that's fucked up [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=435.32000000000005s)]
*  But what hurt people hurt people clearly they were like, oh, I'm gonna get my get back [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=439.44s)]
*  I got this jellyfish looking mother fucker. Yeah unplug the scooter. He's not going [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=444.36s)]
*  I [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=453.6s)]
*  Got your fireworks [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=455.12s)]
*  Damn, okay. So Stephen Hawking. Yeah, besides Stephen Hawking this shit was I mean pretty much everything we knew [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=457.48s)]
*  Copperfield was also fire. You know, Copperfield was wild. So David Copperfield obviously magician [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=462.76000000000005s)]
*  We talked about him in the brand but like apparently he was at the house and just to put in context with all these things [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=466.96000000000004s)]
*  So these are court court documents that have been leaked. So a lot of these things are allegations about people [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=472.04s)]
*  So it's not like hey we have proof that this thing happened somebody is accusing or alleging that this person did it [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=480.08000000000004s)]
*  So with Stephen Hawking basically the way that they get him to the island is in 2006 [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=485.76000000000005s)]
*  He was he was at the island for this academic conference [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=490.20000000000005s)]
*  So I guess there's a bunch of other academics there and now to be fair in 2005 Epstein was accused of [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=493.72s)]
*  Sex trafficking. Yeah, but he wasn't convicted. He was it's big. I think 2008. Yeah, so but still like [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=500.96000000000004s)]
*  Once they put that on you that's the first bit he did in Florida [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=507.0s)]
*  2008 he does the bid [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=511.12s)]
*  2005 he gets accused 2006 the academic conference happens [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=513.16s)]
*  I'm just saying if a dude who allegedly raped an underage girl invites me to his island while there's an open case [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=516.8s)]
*  I'm gonna wait until the verdict [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=523.84s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? Yeah, we really researching everybody we run into though [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=526.36s)]
*  But you should know [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=531.36s)]
*  I [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=533.36s)]
*  Think we just research it's not a wire fraud [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=534.96s)]
*  Now to be fair, let's just call it what it is before we knew all this about Epstein, right? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=538.6s)]
*  It kind of was the place to be [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=545.4s)]
*  And what date what day what year everybody was there what year the president's there not after [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=549.04s)]
*  Jackson's there. Yeah, RfK jr. Is there? Yeah, like everybody's there [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=556.04s)]

*  God the greatest is not only one of the greatest comedians of all time incredibly hilarious [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=1994.5200000000002s)]

*  Whoa cat Williams went on one podcast [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2005.5600000000002s)]
*  Went on one podcast did one interview and sold out his next tour [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2011.0800000000002s)]
*  Two or three times over I bet I would put any amount of money down that he has a new tour [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2017.3200000000002s)]
*  That's either on sale or coming up and that he's adding shows left and right because after watching that [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2022.16s)]

*  But when you mix truth and made up, what did we learn from the Epstein? It's entertaining [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2040.6000000000001s)]
*  It's very entertaining, but I think it's all facts all facts all facts [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2045.64s)]
*  You think and we might have discussed this on patreon you think that Harvey Weinstein [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2049.84s)]
*  Said to him if you let me suck your dick, I'll put you in my movie [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2053.7200000000003s)]
*  Yes, you think he read eight books a day from the age of six to ten [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2057.7200000000003s)]
*  We saw him run the 440 like we saw him we saw well that's different than reading eight books [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2061.7200000000003s)]
*  And if you disprove one thing everything is false so you never know what is true and what is false not a single lawsuit [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2072.4s)]
*  He made mad claims nobody suing him. Let me ask you this question if he's coming to New York [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2078.28s)]
*  Are we going to the show? Absolutely? [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2083.44s)]
*  Are we are we the only people thinking this? No, I'm bringing Noah nigga with me, bro [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2085.7200000000003s)]
*  You forget Nick a bro, he's got his name with three K's [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2093.48s)]
*  That's part of the sponsorship down in the sponsor [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2101.44s)]
*  For you [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2104.48s)]
*  Okay [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2106.32s)]
*  I'm just saying like what a genius way if for example you already are not [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2107.84s)]
*  Like on the up-and-up with some of these people. Let's say they're your enemies. Let's say you're no longer friends with them [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2113.52s)]
*  You're no longer doing business with them. I think the reason why [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2118.8s)]
*  Again I'm not exactly sure but if you don't like some of these people already you don't fuck with them [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2124.08s)]
*  They don't fuck with you. You don't have anything to lose by saying these things [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2128.12s)]
*  Right you could lose potential future relationships with them, but if you don't give a fuck about that then you're good to go. Mm-hmm [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2132.7599999999998s)]
*  It's an interesting approach. It's a very hip hop approach when you think about it. It's like Drake drops the album [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2139.6s)]
*  There's shots at a bunch of different people [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2145.98s)]
*  Now all of a sudden you that oh is he talking about Kendrick? Oh, is he talking about J Cole? [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2148.36s)]
*  Oh, is he talking about the whole world's talking about it now? We know the album is coming out [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2151.64s)]
*  Maybe we know the tour is coming out. It's it's a it's a hip-hop blueprint [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2155.32s)]
*  And it's I think it even hit harder than hip-hop because [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2159.24s)]
*  Comedy has this code where you guys don't do this to one talk about so now he's the one person that's going [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2163.08s)]
*  Up and he didn't even go lightly. He's a light. No, I don't like that's why [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2169.48s)]
*  So yeah, I gotta start with this little code. Yeah, I got and just start shooting 20 look at this [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2174.2799999999997s)]

*  Just tear him down [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2182.8399999999997s)]
*  I [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2184.84s)]
*  Look at this. Yeah, so he's got a bunch of dates. He's doing these arenas [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2186.84s)]
*  These first couple are pretty much sold out. It's cool Wow [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2190.92s)]
*  I mean you're crazy if you don't go see what you got to talk about my question [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2194.1200000000003s)]
*  It's like how much of his material did he already say on the pod or is he just riffing the whole time? [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2198.1600000000003s)]
*  Because some of the things he had set up were like jokes [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2204.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm like some of this gotta be I think definitely in the beginning like he had stuff [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2207.4s)]
*  He wanted to say to say like that first 30 minutes [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2212.2s)]
*  Questions and he was just going yeah, I love how she ain't got the cards, bro. That's awesome and then [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2217.7999999999997s)]
*  What's his face is looking at the cats looking at the cards like you don't even need those my man [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2222.7999999999997s)]

*  All right. I would first off. Do you see that he went he's like now going on the road apparently was like Kevin Hart's ex [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2311.36s)]
*  Did you see this? No, this guy's crazy [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2318.6s)]
*  Not a last crazy crazy because calves calves ex does stand up. Oh, she does. Yes his first wife [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2321.2s)]
*  I believe does stand up and [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2327.3199999999997s)]
*  Tori Hart is that her name thinks. Oh, yeah taking calves ex on the road is crazy, bro [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2329.7599999999998s)]
*  Now you can't do that. Also if you kept X you can't do that. Let that no no no [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2334.68s)]
*  You gotta leave the wives out of it, man [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2339.68s)]
*  That's what I'm saying, but he already brought the wives into he was talking about like people's wives on the pot [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2341.5s)]
*  Yeah [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2346.98s)]
*  If you divorce like nah, cuz the last name is [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2349.98s)]
*  You gotta negotiate that like shorty nah, you keep the house I want my name I [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2357.26s)]
*  Do know women that keep their husbands last name even after divorce just because if they've kids [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2363.34s)]
*  Well kids that's true [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2370.5800000000004s)]
*  But also it's just such a pain in the ass to like you got to go to the DMV to switch your [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2371.94s)]
*  License your insurance is like all this shit and you a single mom. I [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2376.54s)]
*  Don't know exactly if this is true. This is just what's being reported. I'm assuming this is from her Instagram [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2381.5800000000004s)]
*  No, you can't do this. Yeah, so she's doing a couple select dates on his new tour. No, you can't do this [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2386.2200000000003s)]
*  I'm sorry dirty business over here [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2391.7000000000003s)]
*  Devils advocate why not if she's just a comic [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2394.66s)]
*  But she's not just a comic. She's the guy he's taking shots at I mean [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2398.3399999999997s)]
*  So there's a couple ways to look at it one. Is it a device used by cat Williams to? [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2403.8999999999996s)]
*  annoy or [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2411.06s)]
*  embarrass or humiliate [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2413.06s)]
*  Your ex-husband and if that is the case, are you okay with? [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2415.1s)]
*  Potentially aiding and abetting the humiliation of your ex-husband so that you could further your comedy career [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2419.7999999999997s)]
*  Because I'm sure if she was like listen, he's offered me these things. I don't want to take it [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2426.3999999999996s)]
*  Is there anything else you I bet cab would be like y'all come on the road with me [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2430.7999999999997s)]

*  It's like Jimmy Kimmel made jokes about Aaron Rodgers [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2490.54s)]
*  He joked about it and then Aaron Rodgers made a joke about Jimmy Kimmel and then Jimmy Kimmel's like how dare you? [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2494.08s)]

*  But if you start it, you can't be upset if somebody tries to finish it and he threw a jab back [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2513.88s)]
*  so I think it's disappointing you like [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2520.24s)]
*  first of all, Jimmy like has [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2522.6s)]
*  Insanely funny history like in terms of comedy like literally an icon [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2525.64s)]
*  Growing up the earlier stuff you saw of Jimmy was incredible and then to see somebody you look up to like that [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2530.36s)]
*  It's corny. Yeah, like basically going [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2536.72s)]

*  I just thought that Jimmy really could have came back at him easy. Yo, Aaron didn't even say he's gonna find him unless he said [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2552.4s)]
*  He doesn't want it to come out. He's gonna pop champagne. You say yo, you're not you can't pop champagne this year [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2557.16s)]

*  Distraction from the Epstein list right whether he believes that or not doesn't really matter [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2575.96s)]
*  Once you call someone a tinfoil hat conspiracy weirdo [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2581.2799999999997s)]
*  He has the right to make fun of you yeah [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2584.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, like I don't know. All right, you just want to see a comedian come back with jokes [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2588.36s)]
*  Yeah, and we still holding Jimmy to that level of accountability as comedian [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2594.04s)]
*  If you just want to be show host, maybe we don't [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2599.1s)]
*  But we see you as comedian does he still go up. I don't think he goes that he owns a comedy club [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2602.84s)]
*  I mean like he's he doesn't go up. I don't even know if he was a stand-up really he was doing sketch [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2607.88s)]
*  Yeah pranks man shows this man shows incredible like yes, I'm like incredible work. Yeah, and [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2612.14s)]
*  I'm up to comic standards. I still do because if I found you [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2622.38s)]
*  Hilarious, I know what you're capable of. So that's where I hold you. It's like with Eddie Murphy [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2626.74s)]
*  It's like even if he never gets back on stage again [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2631.04s)]
*  I'm always gonna hold into the standard standard of where he was on stage [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2633.1s)]
*  So it's like and there's can't be legal action. That's the only legal life crazy [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2636.98s)]
*  Who's suing for jokes when you started it? Yeah, yo, your shirt sucks. You go yo Schultz get longer pants [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2641.38s)]
*  How dare? [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2648.2999999999997s)]
*  Don't sue out call a lawyer [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2651.66s)]
*  Yeah, it's just uh, huh so the whole like lawsuit thing with cat [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2664.34s)]
*  I don't know if that's like the move if anyone were to sue him back. It would just look crazy [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2669.2s)]
*  Hey, did anybody handle it the best but I mean some of the accusations like Keegan [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2673.24s)]
*  I don't know if Cedric still goes up on stage, but if you're basically saying hey, you're not funny and you steal all your shit [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2678.08s)]
*  Who's going to Cedric show? I? [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2685.96s)]
*  Feel like that's something warranted where it's like no no, I need to clear that up because that's going to hurt ticket sales [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2688.72s)]
*  That's gonna hurt my reputation. Mm-hmm [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2694.6s)]
*  So that's something that if he said I'm coming back legally I would respect it [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2697.0s)]
*  Mmm, that's a good point because it could actually affect. Yeah, but his life is lively [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2702.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, but what if you could come back and clown him in a way that? [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2705.8s)]
*  Will reverse any that damn that would be better. Yeah, but if you don't got nobody writing his comeback [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2709.84s)]
*  So now you [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2715.96s)]
*  Anyway, yeah, I'm just like [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2734.04s)]
*  But I think cats talented enough and funny enough that I feel like you could sell out a tour without having to be taking people down [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2736.16s)]
*  He's undeniably one of the most talented and hilarious comedians ever that being said [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2743.84s)]
*  This works yeah, and sometimes when something works is hard to change [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2751.96s)]
*  Like there are rappers that are [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2757.32s)]
*  Drake is talented enough to not mention another rapper ever once in his in his music ever mm-hmm [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2759.48s)]
*  But when he does it it works, and we start talking we think about the rival we think about the beef mm-hmm so [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2765.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's one of those tricky things is [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2771.32s)]
*  Talent might not mean that you'll just rely on that or find some other [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2774.6400000000003s)]
*  you know creative way to get the attention that you want mm-hmm and [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2779.36s)]
*  Do you think this is gonna start a trend of people promoting their shows by shitting on one another yeah? [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2784.28s)]
*  Usually you see it with more desperate comics [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2792.0800000000004s)]
*  You know what I mean like cat to me is not desperate like like you said he's fucking genius [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2794.88s)]
*  He could have been doing this for fucking decades, but like usually you see with comics [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2800.56s)]
*  They're like they're struggling for relevance or they either lost relevance or and it's not just comics [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2804.1200000000003s)]
*  It's pretty much any industry or they're really resentful that other people that they think they're funnier than have success and [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2809.5s)]
*  That resentment or bitterness kind of comes out through that criticism mm-hmm [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2816.32s)]
*  You know and they're like oh, yeah, these people are only on or these people only doing this because of this thing that they don't [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2821.2s)]
*  do and [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2826.68s)]
*  But it's rare to see it somebody at this level to take those shots unless you in hip-hop and the highest level is who's taking [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2828.12s)]
*  The shots right you may be argue that it happens more at that level mm-hmm [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2834.8399999999997s)]
*  You know because at the lower level who you will be with Drake. They don't even know your name. Yeah, so [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2840.08s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know it's fascinating to see I do think the person I'm handled best was Joe [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2845.48s)]
*  Yo, Joe killed it. He's like we love you. We talked about you on the show all the time [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2849.88s)]
*  I'd love to have you on the show yeah, cuz cat was like yeah [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2853.52s)]
*  He doesn't want me on his show mm-hmm, and he could have been defensive not defensive at all [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2855.7200000000003s)]
*  He's like I love you. I want to have you on the show yeah come on. That would be he saw those numbers [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2859.96s)]
*  I'm sure he probably did beforehand, but I have to say it not who doesn't want but he's always spoken highly of cat like [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2866.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean Cassius got some iconic [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2874.36s)]
*  specials that's the thing like cat [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2877.08s)]
*  I think cat is maybe in his head. He sees himself as like a like a street [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2880.0s)]
*  Dude comic and real for the streets and blah blah, but like I think cat has crossed over to mainstream [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2885.6800000000003s)]
*  With stand-up [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2894.44s)]
*  Like only maybe a handful of other comedies that came up in this in the strictly black circuit in history [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2897.04s)]
*  Like I don't know a white person that hasn't loved its pimpin pimpin or [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2903.32s)]
*  What's the other one hustle every day? [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2908.6s)]
*  Like the pin chronicles American hustle it was like mandatory viewing yeah [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2911.3199999999997s)]
*  So I'm just like I wonder if his perception of his fame is actually skewed [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2916.48s)]
*  Maybe he but doesn't realize how much he's actually crossed over how much white people brown people fuck with him [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2921.48s)]
*  Possibly, but he also is just acting like a comic because you guys are some of the most competitive motherfuckers [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2928.12s)]
*  And sensitive and sensitive so if you combine those two things [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2935.48s)]
*  Sensitiveness oh my god. Yeah, and [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2940.4s)]
*  Begos sometimes like that shit is crazy. Yeah, so he's just kind of just [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2944.08s)]
*  Talking I think the way like sometimes comics might talk in like a green room with some shit like that [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2950.3199999999997s)]
*  But he's just doing it probably he's just airing it out, but he's so calculated. He's so smart [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2954.72s)]
*  He knows what he's doing. That's the thing like oh, yeah, he absolutely knew yeah [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2959.08s)]
*  There's a couple times he chuckled to himself dirty's like who I'm the greatest [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2963.92s)]
*  Dude it shit was gonna go crazy [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=2969.08s)]

*  Their artists artists we are self-absorbed like we're part of this ilk [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3350.08s)]
*  Not only that they're acutely aware that the cameras are on them [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3354.04s)]

*  Which is I'm being watched we've all had a conversation in front of cameras, right? Have you ever had one where like [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3385.4s)]
*  It's like for example an interview right after a fight or something like that where the camera is a guy holding it right here [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3392.48s)]
*  And then the interview is trying to have like a normal conversation with you like vloggers will do this [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3398.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's a giant light on the shit [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3402.7200000000003s)]

*  It feels less uncomfortable because we're talking to the camera guy. Yeah, it's intentional. Hey [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3421.46s)]
*  Hey, but this was what I'm saying is it creates a very uncomfortable environments, okay now [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3426.6600000000003s)]

*  He doesn't give a fuck which is [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3475.06s)]
*  Intoxicating to people in Hollywood because they give so much of a fuck they want it so badly especially on that night that night [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3478.22s)]

*  Don't would love that [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3515.1s)]
*  So [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3520.2599999999998s)]
*  What Ricky did great was he goes all of you guys care about this? [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3521.2999999999997s)]

*  I'm gonna make fun of your asses and when you don't react [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3527.74s)]
*  I don't give a fuck equally and if you watch that he doesn't care when the jokes don't get the reaction that they do [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3530.54s)]
*  Deserve the jokes are great [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3537.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3538.3s)]
*  And I think what happened with Joe is and even from Joe coming on the pot and talking about I think he really did care [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3538.62s)]
*  Yeah, and he talked about it was an important moment for him and his family and everything that he worked for and everything [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3544.36s)]
*  He came from to be there for that moment [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3549.62s)]
*  And then when he started to get maybe the reaction that most most hoped most [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3551.7400000000002s)]
*  Most hosts get I [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3558.1s)]
*  Think it rattled him a little bit. Mm-hmm because it wasn't [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3562.02s)]
*  The massive last that he's used to yeah, he's just a killing in an arena [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3565.66s)]
*  Yeah, exactly where it just whereas Ricky's like I know what this fucking room is gonna be [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3569.02s)]
*  I know that they're gonna grow and I know that they're gonna be pussies and then eventually I'm gonna bowl [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3572.14s)]
*  I'm also the fourth time Ricky hosted fifth fourth or fifth [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3575.9s)]
*  Yeah [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3578.62s)]
*  So and I think that he reacted to that lack of reaction you could tell that he really wanted to win and succeed in that moment [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3578.94s)]
*  Whereas Ricky wanted to it felt like he wanted to troll him a bit [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3585.46s)]
*  And I think that's the best position to be in as the host you got to want to make him grown [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3589.64s)]
*  You got to want to make him uncomfortable. That's the win. It's almost for us as an audience [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3594.46s)]
*  We like to see them squirm [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3599.38s)]
*  We want to see the close-up of Tom Hanks that we all love feeling a little uncomfortable about a joke. We fucking love that. Yeah, and [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3601.06s)]
*  Along with just you know, you gotta have like amazing jokes that let them know you don't care if they like you or not [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3609.7799999999997s)]
*  And they react to that's the big thing like you got to not want to be in Hollywood because those jokes actually might cut deep [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3615.06s)]
*  And somebody be like you'll fuck that guy you make him fun of this director and he's like, alright [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3622.7799999999997s)]
*  Well, you don't need to be my movie. Yeah. Now the guy who goes I don't care if I'm in your movies [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3626.22s)]
*  That director is gonna go I kind of want to work with that [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3630.74s)]
*  Yeah, so I yeah, I think you either need that if you're a comic or you just get like a TV dude [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3634.14s)]
*  that's like a regular kind of miltoast host that's gonna like make some cutesy jokes and [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3639.38s)]
*  Just let it be that exactly. Yeah. Yeah, but that's not gonna slap [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3644.7s)]
*  No, but if you're a TV guy, you don't need to necessarily be funny. You just need to like make a fun environment [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3648.54s)]
*  Yeah, you can do with music. I think they did that once with the Oxsters [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3653.2999999999997s)]
*  There was like a lot of songs or something like a secret. Yeah [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3656.66s)]
*  Yeah, or [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3661.62s)]
*  You know, there's different ways I think to do it, but the expectation will definitely change [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3663.02s)]
*  But I think when you have a comic up there now you have the expectation [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3666.9399999999996s)]
*  When you have a non funny person up there reading a prompter and it's a little bit funny you give it a little bit more [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3671.06s)]
*  I got you got you got you know, I mean, it's like a fat person dancing [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3676.94s)]
*  They've got some coordination. You're like this fat piece of shit. Right girl. It's a three-pointer. You're like, how'd she do it? [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3681.02s)]
*  That's awesome. She did her little step in like a midget grabbing something [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3686.7799999999997s)]
*  Like a raccoon, yeah [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3693.18s)]
*  So so yeah, it's it's a tough situation to win a certain style is definitely gonna work for it like [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3694.98s)]
*  Joe is so charming on stage [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3702.42s)]
*  That room they don't want you to charm them. Yeah, they don't want it. They're like we do the charming [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3704.94s)]
*  We're the likable ones. This is about a you don't need to charm us and Ricky was like, I'm not gonna charm me [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3711.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm gonna fucking roast you all into oblivion. Yeah, and then they then they start laughing cuz they're like well [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3716.82s)]
*  I don't want to be the one that like doesn't get the jokes [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3721.7000000000003s)]
*  They're all still in their head about how they're being perceived and then once the jokes are about them [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3724.2599999999998s)]
*  They're going well if I don't laugh [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3729.98s)]
*  I look like the person that doesn't have a good sense of humor and isn't willing to laugh at myself [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3731.74s)]
*  I better start laughing. Yeah [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3736.58s)]
*  See if you do laughing you're the only person that's laughing then it's like wait am I condoning something that I'm gonna look crazy for [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3738.62s)]
*  Hollywood is a race to be second [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3744.66s)]
*  That's what they say about everything with movies with with TV shows, but also with reacting to the comic [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3746.74s)]
*  Yeah, that's on there. So I think Joe's beating himself up about it. Was it Joe's best performance? No, but maybe now [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3752.54s)]
*  Maybe now he knows how to win that environment or maybe he's like that's not how I want to win it [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3761.9s)]
*  You know, maybe that's not the thing that I want to do with my skill set. Mm-hmm, you know, and it's probably [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3766.98s)]
*  Even harder for him seeing the reception online because like, you know, most of his stuff [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3772.7799999999997s)]
*  He's playing to his fans his comedy is great [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3777.94s)]
*  So it's like I don't think he's probably ever had to have public to deal with the masses like that [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3780.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean he's performing for you know, 10,000 15,000 people every single night in destroying exactly [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3786.06s)]
*  Yes, so that shit has to be rough and you're in front of people you fucking admire like it's also hard [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3792.1800000000003s)]
*  I can imagine literally him talking about his mom loving Meryl Streep [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3798.06s)]
*  You don't think that that's playing in his head [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3801.36s)]
*  Like this part of it's like holy shit this woman is my mother looks up to this woman so much [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3803.44s)]
*  I've created a deity out of her. Yeah, and now I'm in this kind of awkward situation [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3808.54s)]
*  You know, yeah, and then also like the mix like this is something to set a point [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3814.2400000000002s)]
*  I like the mix from the room and how we actually hear it the structure of the room is actually important to that point [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3818.44s)]
*  Yeah, that also everyone in that lower basin. It's [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3824.4s)]
*  Not a list it's the a plus list and they get one guest to be with them in the back second layer of [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3828.04s)]
*  That's it's at the Beverly Hilton [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3835.0s)]
*  It's a mix of like young younger agents people on the team studio executives [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3836.7999999999997s)]
*  HFPA and their their guests there's like a bit it just gets busier back there [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3842.96s)]
*  So you can hear the laughs more in the back, but everyone in the front knows that their potential victim [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3847.3999999999996s)]
*  Those first few jokes got a slap those first few jokes got a tone set a tone [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3852.56s)]
*  They got a bite and they gotta let you know like I think Ricky's first joke was something about um [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3857.16s)]
*  Felicity Huffman. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, my license plate said something Felicity Huffman actually made it Felicity Huffman is an actress [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3863.64s)]
*  That's in jail because of that a college admission scandal. Yeah, so justice [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3869.64s)]
*  Okay, justice but but he's setting a tone like first of all I'm going at y'all mm-hmm [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3875.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm she's not here so we can laugh a little bit, but you're it's gonna be for you, too. Yeah, so get ready and [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3881.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you just gotta go immediately calling them all pedophiles like right up top right [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3889.24s)]
*  Call that Jim Gaffigan did that yeah that Gaffigan [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3895.04s)]
*  So it's like you gotta go right and honestly maybe treat it like prison like go at the top dog [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3898.56s)]
*  Who's top dog? [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3904.16s)]
*  Tom Hanks at your head [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3905.72s)]
*  I'm like if Tom Hanks is laughing we all fucking do it or if he's there and upset [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3908.64s)]
*  I'm not you know it's gonna come to you as well [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3913.96s)]
*  Yeah, you know if it's what's the guy that made Oppenheimer Chris Nolan no Christopher Nolan loved Christopher Nolan, but that movie was [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3916.0s)]

*  I [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3929.08s)]
*  I'm just saying I think it's like the fact that that like it has all the things that should make it good [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3930.64s)]
*  It has Christopher Nolan my favorite director ever it has [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3936.7599999999998s)]

*  During the explosion of those nukes then watching this movie [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3954.36s)]
*  I was envious of the people in Nagasaki [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3960.2s)]
*  I'm being honest. I'd watch I was watching that movie. I was like oh if I could only be [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3965.04s)]
*  In Nagasaki or Hiroshima right now can you imagine Andrew delivering that joke right there on stage? [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3969.32s)]
*  Now here's the thing it would have to be even it would have to be bet it have to be like a real good joke [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3977.12s)]
*  I'm trying to think like what do you say to Nolan? [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=3981.48s)]

*  It doesn't have to explain nothing oh, and every girl that dates him is like I'm gonna be the one [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=4068.06s)]

*  They get extra nice [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=4078.48s)]
*  I would love to see a biopic of like the last six months of all the relationships because you know the girl is just going [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=4079.38s)]

*  You're gonna be alright man [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=4106.82s)]
*  The one thing I didn't like that he did was try to use the writers as a scapegoat when the joke didn't work [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=4108.38s)]
*  Oh, yeah [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=4114.14s)]
*  Like don't don't point that out because it's like I'm sure the writers worked hard on those shits, too [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=4114.860000000001s)]
*  And now you're gonna be like oh my shit's funny, but everybody else sucks [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=4120.06s)]
*  Yeah, I think that was like but I'm I don't know how that that's the you know feeling you felt the sweat from [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=4123.700000000001s)]

*  But there's probably a little defensiveness. Yeah, you know going on as well and [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=4148.0199999999995s)]
*  It's a high-stakes moment for us live. It's live and it feels like it's in front of the world [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=4153.0199999999995s)]
*  God is I mean nobody gives a fuck [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=4158.66s)]
*  It's probably viewed more because of the negative reaction yeah, then if it went great [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=4163.259999999999s)]

*  So some people are rooting for the bulls [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=4825.299999999999s)]
*  Mm-hmm, especially if you're one of these people who owns the bulls you want your bull to be the best and the way that the riders [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=4826.82s)]
*  Can get the highest score is they have to ride the bulls with the highest score and the bulls really have to buck [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=4832.0599999999995s)]

*  People are here for the truth. So [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=5758.06s)]
*  Pat McAfee basically called out someone at ESPN and said that he was sabotaging his show [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=5760.06s)]
*  Did you guys see this? [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=5766.06s)]
*  So he basically called him out and then [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=5768.06s)]
*  If I'm not mistaken [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=5771.9400000000005s)]
*  Brought him on the show [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=5774.9400000000005s)]
*  fire [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=5776.9400000000005s)]
*  Let me make sure this so we don't fuck this whole thing up [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=5778.9400000000005s)]
*  I like your version [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=5780.9400000000005s)]
*  He calls that a guy named [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=5782.9400000000005s)]
*  He says there are some people actively trying to sabotage us from within ESPN [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=5784.9400000000005s)]
*  More specifically, I believe Norby Williamson is the guy who is attempting to sabotage our program [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=5788.9400000000005s)]
*  He [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=5794.9400000000005s)]
*  He's been trying to sabotage the show and [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=5796.9400000000005s)]
*  And say he isn't worth it [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=5799.82s)]
*  So he called the guy out by name and said he was a rat [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=5801.82s)]
*  The guy is like third in charge at ESPN and said he's a douche [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=5804.82s)]
*  So people were like what's going to happen and ESPN did nothing to him [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=5808.82s)]
*  He went on the show [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=5813.82s)]
*  He went on the show today meeting [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=5815.82s)]
*  I guess that guy went on the show and said he stands by what he said. Oh, or maybe that's McAfee. Yeah [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=5816.82s)]
*  He posted for yesterday with the number two in charge and called him a good friend [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=5822.82s)]
*  So people are perplexed because nothing is going to happen to them [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=5827.7s)]
*  But it's kind of a wild thing [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=5830.7s)]
*  Call out someone at your company that's saying he's trying to sabotage you [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=5832.7s)]

*  So I don't know I'm not gonna explain the whole Logan Paul saga thus far [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6059.759999999999s)]
*  Like basically he created this game crypto zoo. The game never came out people bought eggs with the game [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6063.679999999999s)]
*  They lost money and then they haven't been made whole as of you know [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6069.52s)]
*  So the inner bit and that's been absolutely destroying Logan for this because it looks [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6073.72s)]
*  from the surface as if he did a what is a catch-and-run or something like that, there's a [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6078.56s)]
*  Pump and dump or whatever bit basically looks like he stole money from all these people really want to invest in this game [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6083.92s)]
*  Thank you. I feel it busted the whole investigation [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6088.56s)]
*  There's a whole investigation people absolutely furious rightfully furious about it if you invest in money and nothing ever came to a mission [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6090.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's like stealing money from something now [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6096.280000000001s)]
*  You know, we've obviously had Logan on a few times every time we have them on people are upset at us for not asking [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6098.639999999999s)]
*  About this crypto thing. I just want to clarify here. We obviously asked him about the fucking crypto thing [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6103.44s)]
*  He said that there's an open investigation. Can we not talk about it? Can you cut it from the episodes? [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6109.08s)]
*  We're like, yeah sure [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6113.24s)]
*  We'll cut it from the fucking episode now that he's paying back [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6113.84s)]
*  I think that we can talk about this but we if there's any friend of the fucking show that doesn't want a thing in the episode [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6116.96s)]
*  We're not gonna do it. I asked Louie before the episode. Can we talk about there's anything you don't want to talk about [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6122.8s)]
*  He's like, yeah, there might be one gigantic [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6127.2s)]
*  We didn't talk about that at all either. Okay, so [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6129.84s)]
*  But now I guess he's saying that he's gonna pay back the initial investors in [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6134.24s)]
*  People that hurt is the eggs that burst the eggs and the eggs supposed to hatch into these [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6139.24s)]
*  Animals and then you can use like an empty and you can use it inside the game [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6144.2s)]
*  I don't know the exact mechanics. So there's two things to the okay go [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6147.76s)]
*  So our kind of three things so the people that bought the eggs are gonna get paid back on his face [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6150.54s)]
*  It sounds amazing and again, I haven't seen like Logan's response. I just saw coffee's response [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6154.36s)]
*  So maybe there's something happening behind the scenes that is not being fully acknowledged or examined [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6157.599999999999s)]
*  I don't know [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6162.759999999999s)]
*  But basically it seems like he's gonna be paying those people back but not paying back people that bought tokens and the tokens are used as [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6163.08s)]
*  In-game currency in order to buy the eggs [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6171.08s)]
*  Okay, and I think basically Logan's team is saying look the eggs was our fault [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6173.12s)]
*  The game never came out you lost money [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6179.16s)]
*  So you're gonna be made whole in the eggs [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6181.08s)]
*  but the tokens is just a cryptocurrency and I'm not gonna pay back the people that speculated and gambled on crypto and [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6182.16s)]
*  If you lost money on crypto, then that's on you [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6190.16s)]
*  Now let me think about this let me think about this that's all there's part of me that goes [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6194.4s)]
*  Okay, a lot of people invested in different cryptocurrencies that went belly up [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6199.28s)]
*  They speculated in other words [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6204.04s)]
*  They thought that they could make a bunch of money if they bought this thing at a very low amount [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6205.76s)]
*  And hopefully it would go high and they'd be billionaires in center [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6209.0s)]
*  So this could be one of those things that being said if the value of the token [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6211.88s)]
*  Was derived from your ability to play the game and the game itself never came to fruition [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6218.84s)]
*  I do feel like there's a responsibility for the token. That's how coffee made it seem [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6225.4s)]
*  I don't know if the tokens can be used outside. I mean the fucking suspenders on the same fucking side [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6230.58s)]
*  You're suspended for right now don't say that bro, you just gotta wait though you're fucking you're making them come after me [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6235.76s)]
*  I don't know who knows what I have. I've been trying to get him on the pod, man [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6242.0s)]
*  He's busy every time I hit him he was I'm in the middle of an investigation [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6245.8s)]
*  Nothing to do with online tech or money. We don't know he's investigating part of investigation. I get down to it. Okay [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6255.64s)]
*  So, what are we thinking here so it's just tricky on my mind [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6262.280000000001s)]
*  I'm like, I'm glad that he's paying back the people for the eggs. Yes. Awesome. Yes, right [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6265.52s)]
*  We need that I guess that you could make the argument which is like the token is not defunct [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6269.96s)]
*  It if people want to use it and they want to trade it it will have value without said game [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6274.320000000001s)]
*  Mm-hmm, just like any other token that doesn't have a game attached could still have value based on the people trading it [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6279.76s)]
*  And if you buy a token, you're a speculator in the crypto market in general [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6286.4400000000005s)]
*  But you would only buy this token if you thought that it would have value due to the game is coffee's whereas the other [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6289.96s)]
*  Tokens that people buy their pure speculation on that piece of crypto that is attached to absolutely nothing exactly [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6295.6s)]
*  Hey, that's a tricky one. Now. How much more would you have to pay back if he was gonna pay back the token? [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6301.88s)]
*  He didn't specify that in the video [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6307.14s)]
*  That's that's the question. We want we need to know because I'm like if it's an amount that's not crazy [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6309.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm like, you know take the hit yo son if it's another 600 grand or whatever my whole feeling with this shit is like my [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6315.0s)]
*  Man, every time I pay taxes, I hate everybody that lives in Puerto Rico [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6320.92s)]
*  So my whole thing is like how much money have you saved living in Puerto Rico over this amount of time not paying taxes? [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6325.36s)]
*  That's free money. Mm-hmm. We all gotta pay taxes. Yeah, you get that free money [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6332.64s)]
*  Just dump it back into this thing and then you're done [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6337.56s)]
*  Like I people are here people are excited for you to pay this thing back and then just get that stain off [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6340.18s)]
*  Yeah, I kind of doubt this Logan. I assume it's his team. It's his lawyers [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6346.740000000001s)]
*  He pays people to save him money and they're like, yeah, but Logan knows what's going on. He's not stupid [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6349.9800000000005s)]
*  He's he's acutely aware of public perception. And if they feel like you have stolen people's money on this thing that you got fucked over [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6353.9400000000005s)]
*  I hope he can speak more about it. He did get fucked in this thing [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6360.26s)]
*  Now granted he has to take accountability for hiring these people and not vetting them out more [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6362.900000000001s)]
*  But he did get fucked by some scammers and he's suing those people also good as he should [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=6366.78s)]

*  That's posy, but it's a white cast with a black director [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=7952.92s)]
*  Jordan Peele [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=7958.88s)]
*  His movies are not black movies, but they're starring black people yes for a white audience [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=7961.360000000001s)]

*  Jango Unchained [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8013.240000000001s)]
*  Unchained is not a black movie [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8015.4800000000005s)]
*  because it's not speaking to something culturally black that they're relating to and and and and and [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8018.6s)]
*  Being expressed through right the the Jordan Peele movies black people can relate to these that these situations are put in but so do white people [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8026.28s)]
*  It's not something specifically black that's happening to them that they're relating to the characters that movie [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8034.679999999999s)]
*  the [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8040.48s)]
*  Anacondas and those kind of movies are black movies because the reaction to the events are seen through the eyes of the black dude [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8042.16s)]
*  They're like oh my god. That's a big-ass snake [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8048.28s)]
*  Oh [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8055.28s)]

*  That's a big-ass animal. That's bigger than it's supposed to be as a black movie [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8064.84s)]
*  I never went to any of these movies he did so [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8068.0s)]
*  We already saw so he wraps no there's a difference of like [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8071.5199999999995s)]
*  In a New York City theater versus anywhere else pretty much. It's wild. That's true. There's always we smoke in the theater [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8075.8s)]
*  Lot of talking in that I don't know if you did that in LA, but we were smoking the theater back in the day [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8083.72s)]
*  We would their the conversation would happen that would be part of it [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8087.8s)]
*  And if someone would try to shush the people talking nice, I would confuse the head. Yeah, we're like what are you talking about? Shush? [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8091.08s)]
*  We're here for the movie. This is what we're doing like magic Johnson movie theaters were popping [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8098.24s)]
*  Because people would get into it. That is true. Okay [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8102.86s)]
*  So what makes something a black movie? What is the black movie? That's not black the Jordan Peele what there's other ones [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8106.52s)]
*  a [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8112.96s)]
*  Black movie that's not necessarily black. It just has black actors moonlight [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8113.92s)]
*  No, just a gay love story more white than it is black [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8119.8s)]
*  That's interesting black movie. That's not necessarily black, but has black actors. Let's go Denzel Washington movies [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8124.24s)]
*  They're not black movies, they're just movies might have more black actors in them [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8133.2s)]
*  But [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8139.4s)]
*  They're just it's just movie [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8140.76s)]
*  So what makes it black movie has to be culturally representative or relatable in some way and it's not trying to cross over [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8142.24s)]
*  It's not trying to speak to everybody. It's trying to go [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8149.96s)]
*  Hey, these are the people that we want to relate to this movie anybody else wants to look boom [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8152.28s)]
*  He's not trying to speak to anybody just speaking to us the wood other people can like it [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8158.16s)]
*  Yeah, and they can love it, but it's not the attempt. Yeah, Black Panther [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8163.48s)]
*  Not black with my bike. That's actually the greatest example. Black Panther is not a black movie [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8169.24s)]
*  That's a hot take. It's more African than it is black dead ass true. That's a good point true. That's a good point [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8175.92s)]
*  I mean like all the slave movies 12 years of slave white movies. Those are white movies. Those are white very slave movies away [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8182.92s)]
*  interest more Chesent movies [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8189.48s)]
*  Oftentimes they have similar actors playing for sure. Yeah, I [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8193.56s)]
*  I [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8197.199999999999s)]
*  Think we learned a lot guys [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKue3TkoFmY&t=8198.76s)]
