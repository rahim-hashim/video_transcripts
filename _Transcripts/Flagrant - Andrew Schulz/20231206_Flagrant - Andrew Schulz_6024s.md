# Sebastian Maniscalco on Working With DeNiro, Charlie Sheens Comeback, & How The Mob Ended The Nazis
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [December 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs)
*  America, you beautiful pill-popping, gender-swapping, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=0.0s)]
*  central-alerts-snooding, space-exploring, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5.0s)]
*  right-swiping, step-mom-piping champions of the world. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=8.0s)]
*  I've missed you. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=14.0s)]
*  I've taken the life tour all over the world. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=15.0s)]
*  I've crossed more borders than a Chinese spy balloon, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=18.0s)]
*  or as they call them in Montana, a sky-dumpling. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=21.0s)]
*  And now it's time to come back to the greatest country in the world. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=25.0s)]
*  America, baby! [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=29.0s)]
*  In 2024, the life tour is coming all over America, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=30.0s)]
*  like Josh Giddy watching Toddlers and Tiaras. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=34.0s)]
*  And there's one rule, everyone gets these jokes. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=37.0s)]
*  Hey, Seltz, your haircut stinks! [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=40.0s)]
*  I'm clearly trying to film something over here. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=42.0s)]
*  Who cut your hair? Michael J. Fox in an ice bath? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=44.0s)]
*  Shut up and put the music back on. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=47.0s)]
*  Thank you. I'll see you there. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=49.0s)]
*  No, no, really, I'm going to stop playing characters. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=59.0s)]
*  It's really hard to defend. It really fucking sucks, dude. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=62.0s)]
*  You sold out Madison Square Garden a million times. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=65.0s)]
*  Like, you've done arenas around the world, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=68.0s)]
*  and it means nothing the second we're in Hollywood. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=70.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=73.0s)]
*  And they kind of treat you as if it means nothing. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=74.0s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't mean anything. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=76.0s)]
*  Like, was that like being around De Niro? Is he funny at all? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=77.0s)]
*  He would, like, go to his chair after the scene. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=80.0s)]
*  I would go to my chair, and he would have, like, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=82.0s)]
*  you know, a bunch of papers and stuff. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=84.0s)]
*  And he'd be on the phone, he'd be talking. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=86.0s)]
*  He'd be like, is this guy opening up another Nobu? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=88.0s)]
*  In between scenes? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=91.0s)]
*  So, now I'm in a scene. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=94.0s)]
*  Me and De Niro are in a bedroom, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=96.0s)]
*  and we're talking about my wife's side of the family. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=98.0s)]
*  And I think the line was something like, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=101.0s)]
*  yeah, and they're walking around like birds. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=103.0s)]
*  I'm like, yeah! [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=105.0s)]
*  He was even going, what are you doing? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=107.0s)]
*  The next scene, we're like, I'm just sticking around. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=109.0s)]
*  And he's like, I'm just going to go to the bathroom. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=112.0s)]
*  The next scene, we're like, I'm just sticking to the script. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=114.0s)]
*  What's up, everybody? Welcome to the Flaker. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=118.0s)]
*  Today, we are joined by... [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=120.0s)]
*  We got to give compliments up top. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=121.0s)]
*  I know that you're going to hate it, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=123.0s)]
*  but we have to give compliments up top, okay? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=124.0s)]
*  It's quite possibly, well, no, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=126.0s)]
*  absolutely one of the biggest comedians in history, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=129.0s)]
*  probably the biggest comedian alive right now. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=132.0s)]
*  He might be in movies and such. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=134.0s)]
*  He might have a TV show coming out. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=137.0s)]
*  We have Sebastian Mascalfo. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=139.0s)]
*  Let's go! [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=141.0s)]
*  Very sweet of you to say. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=143.0s)]
*  I saw, well, there's two things I want to say. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=145.0s)]
*  First of all, I was watching you on Tiger Belly with Bobby, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=148.0s)]
*  and it was fantastic. You guys were amazing. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=151.0s)]
*  But you told this story, and it resonated so much. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=153.0s)]
*  It was about the nerves and anxiety you had on the Irishman. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=157.0s)]
*  Now, I haven't done the Irishman, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=161.0s)]
*  but there is something about, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=163.0s)]
*  you sold out Madison Square Garden a million fucking times. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=165.0s)]
*  You've done arenas around the world. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=169.0s)]
*  You're the highest selling comic, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=171.0s)]
*  and you walk into a movie set, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=173.0s)]
*  and all that just goes away. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=175.0s)]
*  It goes away, man. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=177.0s)]
*  Yeah, so this is something I'm not used to doing, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=179.0s)]
*  which is acting. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=181.0s)]
*  I do stand-up pretty much every night [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=183.0s)]
*  or trying to work on stuff. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=185.0s)]
*  So now I'm in a scene with Pesci, De Niro, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=187.0s)]
*  and Scorsese's coming out of nowhere. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=191.0s)]
*  I don't even know where this guy is at on set. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=194.0s)]
*  And it's nerve-racking. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=197.0s)]
*  I had a lot of anxiety doing that. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=199.0s)]
*  Also, Pesci's wife, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=201.0s)]
*  he was doing a thing that was like improv-y, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=203.0s)]
*  and it was kind of annoying Pesci, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=205.0s)]
*  and Pesci's wife was like, keep doing it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=207.0s)]
*  So you've got to actively piss off Joe Pesci [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=209.0s)]
*  because his wife is saying it's a good idea, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=211.0s)]
*  but I'm pissing off Joe Pesci? It's like a crazy thing. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=213.0s)]
*  But it's this weird thing that I think is like, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=215.0s)]
*  I wonder if it's only in us where we can feel [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=217.0s)]
*  like the top of the world in our industry [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=219.0s)]
*  and that it means nothing the second we're in Hollywood. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=221.0s)]
*  And they kind of treat you as if it means nothing. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=224.0s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't mean anything. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=227.0s)]
*  Did the grips and stuff, the people who work on the movie, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=229.0s)]
*  they know you and you're like the biggest star, right? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=232.0s)]
*  See, I never even think anybody knows me. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=235.0s)]
*  I swear to God. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=238.0s)]
*  But I get what he's saying. Go ahead, go ahead. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=240.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, every time I put tickets on sale, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=242.0s)]
*  I ask myself, is anybody coming? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=246.0s)]
*  So I'll give you an example. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=249.0s)]
*  I did this voiceover in Super Mario Brothers. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=253.0s)]
*  I was Spike. I have two kids, six and four. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=256.0s)]
*  We're at Universal Studios. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=259.0s)]
*  By the way, I feel like I have to come to the right here, too, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=261.0s)]
*  because of the cologne. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=265.0s)]
*  I'm going to walk you over here. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=267.0s)]
*  Every time I feel like I need... [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=269.0s)]
*  It's like warm pie. You smell it in a cartoon. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=271.0s)]
*  The Italians are just drawn to it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=273.0s)]
*  Is that Tom Ford? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=275.0s)]
*  So we're at Universal Studios. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=277.0s)]
*  There is a Super Mario store. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=279.0s)]
*  So I said, kids, come on in. Let's go see Daddy's character. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=281.0s)]
*  They got every character on the wall but mine, Spike. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=285.0s)]
*  So that kind of sums up my career. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=289.0s)]
*  I have fans, but I'm not like widely known. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=291.0s)]
*  That's funny you think that. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=297.0s)]
*  That's so funny you think that. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=299.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't believe that at all. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=301.0s)]
*  That's the way I feel. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=303.0s)]
*  But I know that's the way you feel, and I felt that. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=305.0s)]
*  Like I felt that in films or in Hollywood in general. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=307.0s)]
*  I think it's just because they care so little about stand-up. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=309.0s)]
*  Like The Hollywood Matrix thinks it's like this weird like sideshow. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=311.0s)]
*  And we walk in and we're like, wait a minute, no, no, no. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=315.0s)]
*  This is the coolest thing and we're the best at it. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=319.0s)]
*  And they're like, that's great. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=321.0s)]
*  Here's your lines, here's your set, there's your trailer you're sharing with three other guys, there's one bathroom. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=323.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=325.0s)]
*  And you're like, I travel on a bus everywhere I go. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=327.0s)]
*  We don't get fucked. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=329.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=331.0s)]
*  It doesn't translate over to, like you're saying, TV and film. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=333.0s)]
*  But that's expected. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=335.0s)]
*  Do we welcome to the stand-ups, welcome the actors to our? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=337.0s)]
*  You always hear this guy that's going to do stand-up, but he was something else prior. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=339.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=341.0s)]
*  And do we go, oh yeah, you're part of the family? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=343.0s)]
*  Do we do that? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=345.0s)]
*  We think that your career is struggling. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=347.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=349.0s)]
*  I was doing it again. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=351.0s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=353.0s)]
*  I just don't always want to, why is stand-up always the default to somebody else's other career? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=355.0s)]
*  It's not like we're going into professional football. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=357.0s)]
*  It's not like we're going into professional football. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=359.0s)]
*  It's not like we're going into professional football. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=361.0s)]
*  It's not like we're going into professional football. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=363.0s)]
*  It's not like we're going into professional football. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=365.0s)]
*  It's either stand-up or DJing. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=367.0s)]
*  It's either stand-up or DJing. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=369.0s)]
*  That's the fallback. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=371.0s)]
*  That's the fallback. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=373.0s)]
*  Dude, you know the first time I saw you, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=375.0s)]
*  I went to school at University of California at Santa Barbara. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=377.0s)]
*  I grew up here in New York, but I went to school at UCSB. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=379.0s)]
*  And I managed a restaurant called Bricks Cafe. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=381.0s)]
*  And once a week there was a comedy night. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=383.0s)]
*  And once a week there was a comedy night. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=385.0s)]
*  And once a week there was a comedy night. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=387.0s)]
*  Do you remember? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=389.0s)]
*  I didn't know that you managed a joint, though. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=391.0s)]
*  I think it was like a small crate in the corner. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=393.0s)]
*  I think it was like a small crate in the corner. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=395.0s)]
*  Let me see if I got the right restaurant. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=397.0s)]
*  Let me see if I got the right restaurant. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=399.0s)]
*  You walk in, and wasn't it to the left? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=401.0s)]
*  You walk in, and wasn't it to the left? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=403.0s)]
*  And there's a full window. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=405.0s)]
*  So people can see from the outside. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=407.0s)]
*  You managed that place? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=409.0s)]
*  I had no idea. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=411.0s)]
*  Into the ground. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=413.0s)]
*  I managed two restaurants, both out of business. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=415.0s)]
*  Did you start the comedy night there? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=417.0s)]
*  No, it was Andre Belikov's start. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=419.0s)]
*  He wasn't even a comic. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=421.0s)]
*  Oh, he weren't? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=423.0s)]
*  I was just a fan of comedy. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=425.0s)]
*  I watched it growing up. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=427.0s)]
*  And it was just random that I was working at this restaurant, and then this guy opened another one. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=429.0s)]
*  And he was dumb enough to let me manage it. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=431.0s)]
*  I wrote him a manual. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=433.0s)]
*  I was like, this is what I think you should do. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=435.0s)]
*  And I gave it to him. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=437.0s)]
*  And he was this Argentine guy. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=439.0s)]
*  And he was like, I think this guy's good. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=441.0s)]
*  I think, no, it wasn't good. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=443.0s)]
*  But I remember you coming there. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=445.0s)]
*  There was a bunch of people that came up. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=447.0s)]
*  You came up. I remember you doing the Ross bit. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=449.0s)]
*  Oh my God, dude. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=451.0s)]
*  Which is like, iconic bit. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=453.0s)]
*  It's hard to do the Ross bit in there. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=455.0s)]
*  Say again? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=457.0s)]
*  It's hard to do it in here. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=459.0s)]
*  You almost fell off the stage. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=461.0s)]
*  It sure didn't go far. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=463.0s)]
*  It sure went like 20 feet. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=465.0s)]
*  But it was like, I remember watching it. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=467.0s)]
*  And you're not like a talent scout at the time. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=469.0s)]
*  But I'm just like, holy shit. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=471.0s)]
*  This is something different. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=473.0s)]
*  The energy is something different going on here. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=475.0s)]
*  And then you really fucking exploded, huh? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=477.0s)]
*  Fucking hell. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=481.0s)]
*  From that restaurant career. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=483.0s)]
*  I was trying to think this. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=485.0s)]
*  Wait, real quick. My first story also fucking... [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=487.0s)]
*  It was 2007. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=489.0s)]
*  I had just started comedy in LA. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=491.0s)]
*  And we go watch. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=493.0s)]
*  The three major clubs had their Black Night. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=495.0s)]
*  Comedy stores was tripping on Tuesday. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=497.0s)]
*  Which wasn't the roughest room, but it can be choppy. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=499.0s)]
*  Sebastian goes on stage. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=501.0s)]
*  I'm watching this white dude. It's dead. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=503.0s)]
*  And then he just goes, I like that. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=505.0s)]
*  Confidence. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=507.0s)]
*  And then the confidence he had. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=509.0s)]
*  I swear to you, I don't think to this day I've ever seen a comic level of room like that. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=511.0s)]
*  I think you're talking about Kramer, the laughing. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=515.0s)]
*  No, dude. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=517.0s)]
*  Tony Roberts, who's so funny. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=519.0s)]
*  And such a killer host. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=521.0s)]
*  He gets back on stage for three minutes. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=523.0s)]
*  He's laughing at Sebastian's bit. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=525.0s)]
*  Like, about two minutes. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=527.0s)]
*  And then he goes, I like that. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=529.0s)]
*  I like that. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=531.0s)]
*  He's laughing at Sebastian's bit. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=533.0s)]
*  Like, about the drinks with the umbrella in it. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=535.0s)]
*  He's dying laughing leaning over the stool. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=537.0s)]
*  Like, the dude I was sitting with got an umbrella in his drink. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=539.0s)]
*  I'd never seen. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=541.0s)]
*  And that was the first time I ever was like, oh, that's what you can do with a set. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=543.0s)]
*  I'd been watching comedy, but that stuck with me for years. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=547.0s)]
*  Okay, I need to get back to the beginning. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=551.0s)]
*  Do you start in LA or did you start in Chicago? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=553.0s)]
*  I started in Los Angeles. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=555.0s)]
*  Moved in 1998. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=557.0s)]
*  From Chicago. Graduated Northern Illinois University. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=559.0s)]
*  I did comedy once there for the up and coming or no, it was the guy coming in to entertain the students. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=561.0s)]
*  It was the headliner. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=569.0s)]
*  College entertainment. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=571.0s)]
*  You opened for? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=573.0s)]
*  I opened up for that guy. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=575.0s)]
*  Did the Fratt brothers come out? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=577.0s)]
*  Who? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=579.0s)]
*  You were in the Fratt, weren't you? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=581.0s)]
*  At that time, my parents came. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=583.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=585.0s)]
*  Terrifying. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=587.0s)]
*  I died on stage that night. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=589.0s)]
*  And they were like, this is what we're paying college for today? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=591.0s)]
*  So I moved out in 98 and I just started kicking around Los Angeles doing open mic nights. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=593.0s)]
*  So you bombed and was like, now this is what I'm going to do? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=601.0s)]
*  I just knew I felt comfortable up there and this was where I should be. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=605.0s)]
*  I was a huge fan of stand up at a young age and I always knew I was going to go into stand up comedy. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=609.0s)]
*  I just didn't know how. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=615.0s)]
*  What was your introduction? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=617.0s)]
*  I used to watch HBO at night at the improv, all that stuff at my cousin's house on Saturday morning because I didn't have cable. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=619.0s)]
*  So I used to watch all of that stuff and I used to digest it like it was game tape. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=629.0s)]
*  Fascinated. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=635.0s)]
*  How do they remember all this? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=637.0s)]
*  This is fantastic. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=639.0s)]
*  I want to do this. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=641.0s)]
*  How do you even get into this? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=643.0s)]
*  Where do you even go to do this? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=645.0s)]
*  But I just fell in love with it and then decided I was going to move out to Los Angeles in 1998 to pursue a career. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=647.0s)]
*  Was there one stand up that you saw that you're like, holy? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=653.0s)]
*  I remember seeing Bernie Mac when I was younger and it didn't make me go, I want to be a stand up comedian, but it made me go, holy shit. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=657.0s)]
*  That's how hard you can make people laugh. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=665.0s)]
*  That was the bar. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=667.0s)]
*  And obviously Eddie Delirious, but was there someone you saw? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=669.0s)]
*  It wasn't like a guy that came up. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=671.0s)]
*  What I used to do was watch Johnny Carson at night and he used to have comedians on and I was like, oh, wow, this is great. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=673.0s)]
*  And people come in and make people laugh. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=679.0s)]
*  And then I started getting into it from there. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=681.0s)]
*  I started watching George Carlin and Eddie Murphy, Don Rickles. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=683.0s)]
*  I was a huge fan of Don Rickles. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=687.0s)]
*  So it was a variety of different comedians that I saw over a period of time. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=689.0s)]
*  It wasn't one guy where I go, oh, yeah, that's the guy. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=693.0s)]
*  It was a culmination of people. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=697.0s)]
*  Okay, you're just obsessed with the sport of comedy. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=699.0s)]
*  Okay, so you go out to LA. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=701.0s)]
*  When I remember you doing the Vince Vaughn. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=703.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=707.0s)]
*  What was it called? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=708.0s)]
*  Wild West Comedy Show. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=709.0s)]
*  Is that the first break? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=711.0s)]
*  Is that the first time where you feel like I have some traction or were you already like the local guy? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=713.0s)]
*  I was not anything. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=719.0s)]
*  I was just going, doing comedy clubs, not touring at all. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=721.0s)]
*  I was working at the four seasons. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=725.0s)]
*  Day job? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=727.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=728.0s)]
*  Oh, I thought at this point you'd already kind of like, you were like established LA, like headlining locally. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=729.0s)]
*  No. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=736.0s)]
*  With no day job. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=737.0s)]
*  So you had. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=738.0s)]
*  I'm still delivering chicken satays to table 109 at the Four Seasons. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=739.0s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=746.0s)]
*  When Vince Vaughn asked me to do this. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=747.0s)]
*  How did Vince even find you? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=749.0s)]
*  At Dublin's. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=751.0s)]
*  There was a place called Dublin's on Sunset. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=752.0s)]
*  They had a. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=755.0s)]
*  Comedy night. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=756.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=757.0s)]
*  Tuesday night Dublin's. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=758.0s)]
*  And it was upstairs. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=759.0s)]
*  Timberlake used to go, Vince Vaughn. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=761.0s)]
*  It was like a haven for celebrities at the point. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=763.0s)]
*  Dane Cook at that time was the guy. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=766.0s)]
*  And I met him there through a comedian by the name of Ahmed Ahmed. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=768.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=772.0s)]
*  And Vince and I started talking in the stairwell. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=773.0s)]
*  He's from Chicago. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=777.0s)]
*  I'm from Chicago. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=778.0s)]
*  Starts talking this, that, and the other. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=779.0s)]
*  Next thing you know, a couple months go by. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=780.0s)]
*  And through Ahmed asked me to come on the Vince Vaughn Wild West Comedy Show. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=782.0s)]
*  So I had to go and ask work. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=786.0s)]
*  Can I take a month off? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=788.0s)]
*  To be in a movie. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=790.0s)]
*  Because I didn't know. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=791.0s)]
*  I mean, I wasn't getting paid a lot of money. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=794.0s)]
*  It wasn't like something I could just lose my job. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=796.0s)]
*  And I'm very responsible. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=798.0s)]
*  I'm very responsible. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=799.0s)]
*  Like the first thing my mother asked me when I moved out in 1998. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=801.0s)]
*  What are you going to do for health insurance? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=805.0s)]
*  I'm not one of these guys that just lives on people's couches. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=810.0s)]
*  You should set up. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=814.0s)]
*  I came out with savings. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=816.0s)]
*  It's not like Axl Rose where he's got a Qatar and some change. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=819.0s)]
*  I came out with 10 grand. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=822.0s)]
*  Responsible. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=824.0s)]
*  Signed a lease. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=825.0s)]
*  And so, yeah, I took off work for a month. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=827.0s)]
*  But I never went back after that. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=831.0s)]
*  That was 2005. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=833.0s)]
*  So 98 to 200. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=834.0s)]
*  That was like a subplot in the movie, I remember, about you waiting tables. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=835.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=838.0s)]
*  All right, guys. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=839.0s)]

*  I went there one time. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=847.0s)]

*  Now let's get back to this show. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=888.0s)]
*  Okay, that night that Vince is there, did you know that he's watching when you're going on? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=889.0s)]
*  Or did you already go on and then you saw him in the hallway? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=894.0s)]
*  I didn't know he was in the room. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=897.0s)]
*  So I had gone on and came off. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=898.0s)]
*  So much better that way. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=900.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=901.0s)]
*  He was delivering the chicken satay still. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=902.0s)]
*  I had waited on Vince Fawn though years before that. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=904.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=908.0s)]
*  Yeah, but he didn't know that. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=909.0s)]
*  I mean, I waited on him, I think in 2001. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=910.0s)]
*  But- [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=912.0s)]
*  Did he tip good? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=913.0s)]
*  Does he tip good? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=914.0s)]
*  He didn't pay. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=915.0s)]
*  It was the agents that would lose. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=916.0s)]
*  So I pretty much know of every celebrity's tipping habits working at the Four Seasons. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=917.0s)]
*  And what do we got? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=922.0s)]
*  Shaq's the best. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=923.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=924.0s)]
*  What does Shaq do? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=925.0s)]
*  What does Shaq do? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=926.0s)]
*  Shaq come in on a Sunday by himself, walk through the bar, used to sit by himself. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=927.0s)]
*  This is not every Sunday, but a few, order a fruit plate. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=932.68s)]
*  And- [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=939.0s)]
*  I like how you just protect the Shaq right there. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=940.0s)]
*  What? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=941.0s)]
*  Every Sunday. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=942.0s)]
*  Not everyone. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=943.0s)]
*  Maybe a couple times Shaq was there. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=944.0s)]
*  A few times, a few times. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=945.0s)]
*  Right after church. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=946.0s)]
*  And then have a little fruit. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=947.0s)]
*  A little, what else did he have? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=949.0s)]
*  Oh, coffee. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=954.0s)]
*  But I used to serve the coffee to him in a big cappuccino cup because it's like serving [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=955.0s)]
*  a giant. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=962.0s)]
*  I could serve him a little teacup. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=963.0s)]
*  I could bring out the big cappuccino. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=966.0s)]
*  And he would never ask for a check, just left $100 under the plate. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=969.0s)]
*  Every time. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=972.0s)]
*  Every time. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=973.0s)]
*  And at that point, I was like, I'm going to go to church. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=974.0s)]
*  At that point, I wasn't, I was like, hey, what's up, Shaq? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=977.0s)]
*  I was very professional. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=981.0s)]
*  You had to act like that wasn't a celebrity. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=982.0s)]
*  Hello, Mr. O'Neill, how you doing? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=985.0s)]
*  And yeah, he was one of the best tippers there was. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=988.0s)]
*  Who's the worst though? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=991.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, what was the question? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=992.0s)]
*  Who's the worst tipper? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=993.0s)]
*  Worst tipper? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=994.0s)]
*  I didn't really run into a really awful, awful, I don't have a bad story. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=995.0s)]
*  Sorry, I know you guys probably really relish in a great story. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1000.0s)]
*  Are you a good tipper? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1004.0s)]
*  I'd like to think I'm pretty, pretty fabulous when it comes to tippin'. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1006.0s)]
*  That's pretty fabulous. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1010.0s)]
*  Okay, okay, okay. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1012.0s)]
*  What do you, let's say, for example, dropping your car, because I've heard some legendary tipping, right? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1013.0s)]
*  Like, you know, I remember I was hanging with Rogan once, he drops the car off, it's $100, picks it up, it's $100. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1018.0s)]
*  Okay, that's, that's, that's, that's aggressive. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1025.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1029.0s)]
*  He's responsible. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1030.0s)]
*  He's responsible, he just said he was responsible. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1032.0s)]
*  He's responsible. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1034.0s)]
*  Okay, so say you're dropping your car off, how much? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1035.0s)]
*  What do you, what is, what do they expect? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1039.0s)]
*  Dropping my car off, where am I driving? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1041.0s)]
*  Is it a hotel or is it any valet service? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1043.0s)]
*  Just a valet. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1045.0s)]
*  General valet. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1046.0s)]
*  General valet. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1047.0s)]
*  I didn't even know you were supposed to drive. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1048.0s)]
*  It's only when you pick it up. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1051.0s)]
*  No, it is when you pick it up. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1054.0s)]
*  No, no, the keep it close tip. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1055.0s)]
*  The keep it close tip. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1057.0s)]
*  Let's break it all down. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1058.0s)]
*  Let's break it all down. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1059.0s)]
*  Let's break it all down. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1060.0s)]
*  The keep it close tip is I think $100 because I used to work at the Four Seasons, used to [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1061.0s)]
*  talk to those guys and they had five or six spots reserved and I used to ask, what do [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1065.0s)]
*  you tip to get that spot? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1070.0s)]
*  He goes, that's a minimum of $100, right? [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1072.0s)]
*  Now if you give them a $20, right, and they have the availability, they might leave it [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1074.0s)]
*  up top, but I think $100 ensures you that spot. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1079.0s)]
*  The $100 on the way out is almost natural life. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1083.0s)]
*  $200 on a car is a lot of money. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1088.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1092.0s)]
*  So what do you think on the way out? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1093.0s)]
*  $10? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1095.0s)]
*  On the way out, it's a $20. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1096.0s)]
*  A $20 if you tipped already. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1098.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's reasonable. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1100.0s)]
*  So if you tipped $100 and the guy brings it up, it's $20, right? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1101.0s)]
*  $120 is a lot just to put the car somewhere. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1104.0s)]
*  It is, but I tell you, the convenience of it is just ... [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1106.0s)]
*  Okay, what about a place you frequent a lot? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1111.0s)]
*  What about the store or the improv back in the day? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1115.0s)]
*  Like you're just dropping your car ... [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1118.0s)]
*  Every once in a while you tip those guys. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1119.0s)]
*  Where are you going? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1126.0s)]
*  Where are you going? [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1128.0s)]
*  I got to stand up now? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1130.0s)]
*  It's a cyanide thing. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1134.0s)]
*  I feel like I got to start moving around. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1136.0s)]
*  I'm there every night. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1138.0s)]
*  You tip every time. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1140.0s)]
*  What do you mean every once in a while? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1142.0s)]
*  Every once in a while. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1144.0s)]
*  Hey, you're right. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1149.0s)]
*  I generally park my old car there and then I leave, but every once in a while I'll give the guy, whoever's running ... [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1150.0s)]
*  I'll give them $50 or $100. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1154.0s)]
*  Okay, but that's not in every single time. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1156.0s)]
*  No, that's not every single time. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1158.0s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1160.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1162.0s)]
*  Sometimes I don't have my wallet on me or whatnot. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1164.0s)]
*  I don't have cash available and sometimes I'm like, all right, I ain't tipping today. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1166.0s)]
*  You don't even have a car. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1172.0s)]
*  New Yorkers don't have cars, so they don't even understand that. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1174.0s)]
*  Well, I bought a fake Porsche, but then it broke down. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1176.0s)]
*  You bought a fake Porsche? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1178.0s)]
*  Yeah, I bought a kid car. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1179.0s)]
*  Oh, a kid car. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1181.0s)]
*  On purpose? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1182.0s)]
*  He got hustled. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1184.0s)]
*  It was a Persian businessman. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1186.0s)]
*  It was a half a million dollar real one or a $50,000 fake one, and I'm like, I'm going to have to replace everything in this real one anyway, so just give me the fake one for 50 grand. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1187.0s)]
*  And now you got to replace the entire car. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1196.0s)]
*  It was beautiful. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1198.0s)]
*  It was so beautiful. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1199.0s)]
*  It was very pretty. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1200.0s)]
*  You don't have it anymore? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1201.0s)]
*  Didn't work for shit. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1202.0s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1203.0s)]
*  Oh, it don't work? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1204.0s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't really work. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1205.0s)]
*  Did we sell it? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1206.0s)]
*  Yeah, but it's still over there. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1207.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1208.0s)]
*  You're looking for a kid car? [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1209.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1210.0s)]
*  If you want a kid, I got a nice kid. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1211.0s)]
*  We can't just skip over what just happened here. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1212.0s)]
*  What just happened right there? [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1214.0s)]
*  You don't know if you got a car? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1216.0s)]
*  You like that? [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1224.0s)]
*  Did we sell it? [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1225.0s)]
*  No. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1226.0s)]
*  You don't know if you tip? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1228.0s)]
*  I don't know if I got a car. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1229.0s)]
*  It is what it is. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1230.0s)]
*  He's in charge of the automotive garage you have? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1232.0s)]
*  Because what happens when I do it? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1236.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1237.0s)]
*  I buy a fake fucking Porsche. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1238.0s)]
*  Which was not under my advisement. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1239.0s)]
*  I just wanted everyone to notice. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1240.0s)]
*  Nope. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1242.0s)]
*  But it's a beautiful car that he built on the outside. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1243.0s)]
*  We had a couple of good runs around Soho. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1246.0s)]
*  I had to push it around Soho. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1248.0s)]
*  And first of all, I'm from New York, so people kind of know me, and I'm in like the most [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1250.0s)]
*  I have to stop and look at new car. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1255.0s)]
*  And I have to walk it around cobblestone streets in fucking Soho. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1258.0s)]
*  It was so unbelievably embarrassing. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1262.0s)]
*  Like cobblestone. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1266.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1267.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1268.0s)]
*  So the mechanic sold it, but the car is so beautiful, he leaves it in front of his West [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1269.0s)]
*  Village location. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1274.0s)]
*  People keep taking pictures all day long. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1275.0s)]
*  What do you tip the garage? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1277.0s)]
*  This is a tricky one for me. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1279.0s)]
*  The garage is like every single, whatever, we're doing this every day. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1281.0s)]
*  Meaning going into a parking structure. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1284.0s)]
*  My parking garage. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1286.0s)]
*  That's a New York thing. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1287.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's right. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1288.0s)]
*  You probably never had a garage. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1289.0s)]
*  Yeah, like a house. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1290.0s)]
*  No. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1291.0s)]
*  That's a Christmas gift. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1292.0s)]
*  Like a human being. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1293.0s)]
*  A nice gift. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1294.0s)]
*  You know what my pops used to do? [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1295.0s)]
*  My pops would always, he would get him a nice Christmas bonus, but he would always bring [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1296.0s)]
*  another coffee. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1300.0s)]
*  And it was just like he'd always come with two, and there'd be another coffee. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1301.0s)]
*  That's a classy touch. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1304.0s)]
*  That is pure class. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1305.0s)]
*  It's a dollar, but at the same time, it's like, well maybe you wanted a nice coffee. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1306.0s)]
*  Well, I like that move. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1310.0s)]
*  I also like, if you're seeing this guy every day and it's a garage, I like the end of the [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1312.0s)]
*  year kind of Christmas gift. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1317.0s)]
*  To do it every day, it gets a little, I think, monotonous and gross. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1319.0s)]
*  Gross. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1324.0s)]
*  A little aggressive. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1325.0s)]
*  Yeah, a little aggressive. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1326.0s)]
*  I think a nice gift for the doorman, for the garage guy, a nice Hermes blanket. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1329.0s)]
*  Do you get bothered when you drive? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1335.0s)]
*  A nice Hermes blanket. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1336.0s)]
*  Do you get road rage at all when you're driving? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1338.0s)]
*  No, at this age, I actually relish the time in traffic. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1340.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1346.0s)]
*  Generally, when I'm driving and I'm going to get in traffic, I'm alone. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1347.0s)]
*  And those times, if I have an audio book or a podcast on, I actually welcome it. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1352.0s)]
*  There's no real road rage. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1357.0s)]
*  And when I have kids, to me, it's more time in the car with them. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1359.0s)]
*  So I like it. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1363.0s)]
*  Yes, you like the family. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1364.0s)]
*  You like the kids. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1366.0s)]
*  I'm a family guy. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1367.0s)]
*  Very traditional, very family. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1368.0s)]
*  Okay, we're not into the family yet. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1369.0s)]
*  I want to get to family, but I know because your rise is crazy because I think you're [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1370.0s)]
*  also one of the first people to explode from the internet. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1376.0s)]
*  And I don't know if a lot of people know that. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1380.0s)]
*  I don't think I know that. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1383.0s)]
*  Your clips, you didn't know what was happening with you and what was happening on Facebook? [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1385.0s)]
*  I was unaware of what was happening. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1392.0s)]
*  I'm about to be so angry. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1396.0s)]
*  Listen, listen. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1397.0s)]
*  Listen, I was unaware of what was happening outside my little ether. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1398.0s)]
*  I post my stuff. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1404.0s)]
*  Okay, I post my stuff. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1406.0s)]
*  But you didn't know. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1407.0s)]
*  I didn't know until later on. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1408.0s)]
*  Okay, because you had the specials. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1411.0s)]
*  There were Showtime specials. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1412.0s)]
*  And you were clipping over, someone was clipping, they were putting them on Facebook, etc. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1414.0s)]
*  But some of these jokes would just go insane on Facebook. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1418.0s)]
*  And you didn't notice a crazy spike in sales. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1422.0s)]
*  There had to be a moment where you're like, okay, I'm selling out clubs. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1425.0s)]
*  And now it's theater. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1427.0s)]
*  Like where was the jump for you? [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1431.0s)]
*  I thought it was, I just. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1432.0s)]
*  Hot in here, right? [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1434.0s)]
*  Sorry, go on. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1435.0s)]
*  Because you're moving. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1436.0s)]
*  You're standing up. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1439.0s)]
*  It always gets hot when I do this podcast. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1441.0s)]
*  No, I'm actually a good gauge of temperature. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1446.0s)]
*  You're a good gauge of temperature. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1450.0s)]
*  And if I'm cool, it's not hot in here. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1451.0s)]
*  Okay, it's not. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1454.0s)]
*  But if you feel hot, go ahead. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1455.0s)]
*  Put up the air conditioner. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1458.0s)]
*  You guys hot? [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1459.0s)]
*  I feel like I'm being insulted right now. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1460.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1463.0s)]
*  I'm being insulted. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1464.0s)]
*  Do I have to tip them? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1465.0s)]
*  What do you tip for AC? [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1466.0s)]
*  I tip AC $25. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1467.0s)]
*  That's pretty good. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1468.0s)]
*  That's pretty fabulous. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1469.0s)]
*  It wasn't a nice 72, but. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1470.0s)]
*  Okay, okay, go on, go on. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1471.0s)]
*  So I thought, because I stayed in the clubs for a while. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1474.0s)]
*  Further than most people stay in the clubs. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1478.0s)]
*  Because I was like, I don't even know if I could sell theaters. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1480.0s)]
*  I did 14 Gotham Comedy Club shows. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1483.0s)]
*  And they're like, I think it's time to do that. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1486.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1489.0s)]
*  Will they come? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1490.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1491.0s)]
*  So I thought it was just from going on the road and doing the comedy clubs, establishing [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1492.0s)]
*  a fan base. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1497.0s)]
*  I did see an uptick in some of followers and whatnot. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1498.0s)]
*  But I don't attribute it to like, oh, wow, I blew up on the Internet. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1501.0s)]
*  I don't know if I ever really wrap my head around that. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1505.0s)]
*  2018, I had three different family members talk to me about you specifically. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1508.0s)]
*  I remember that's when I was like, oh, because I'd always remembered Sebastian from that [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1513.0s)]
*  set. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1516.0s)]
*  And I was like, oh, now it's over. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1517.0s)]
*  It's over. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1518.0s)]
*  I saw there was a thing that like, there's a thing that happened that kind of, it didn't [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1519.0s)]
*  explain your fame, explained how you're selling so many tickets to me. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1525.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1530.0s)]
*  Because obviously I saw it. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1531.0s)]
*  It was amazing, been a fan. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1532.0s)]
*  The perception at first was like, okay, this is really personal. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1535.0s)]
*  He's talking about like really specific, you know, his culture. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1538.0s)]
*  Okay, maybe Italians are coming out in droves. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1542.0s)]
*  And it was a Somali friend of mine that goes, oh, yeah, I mean, like me and my mom watch [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1545.0s)]
*  him like crazy. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1550.0s)]
*  That's like her favorite comedian. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1551.0s)]
*  It's one of my favorite comedians. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1552.0s)]
*  And I go, explain that. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1553.0s)]
*  And he goes, oh, like everything he talks about is my family. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1555.0s)]
*  I go, what? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1558.0s)]
*  And he goes, he goes, yeah. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1559.0s)]
*  Because yeah, and at that moment I realized it's a first generation or second generation [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1561.0s)]
*  relatability in America. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1568.0s)]
*  And it's probably why like, you know, from my mom's side, I'm kind of relating to it, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1570.0s)]
*  but you have all these people coming out. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1575.0s)]
*  Did you start to see that like in diversity in the audience? [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1577.0s)]
*  Yeah, first of all, I had no idea. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1581.0s)]
*  No idea. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1584.0s)]
*  I was huge in Somalia. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1585.0s)]
*  Big. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1586.0s)]
*  Big. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1587.0s)]
*  You gotta do a show. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1588.0s)]
*  But you don't have to be Italian to get this. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1590.0s)]
*  You could be Indian. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1592.0s)]
*  You could be Puerto Rican, black, whatever you are. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1593.0s)]
*  If you have like a family and a dynamic in your family, I use my father as a big source [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1596.0s)]
*  of comedy. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1602.0s)]
*  I think people relate to it regardless of what background you're from. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1603.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is an immigrant story. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1607.0s)]
*  It has those immigrant little innuendos that maybe some immigrant families could relate [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1609.0s)]
*  to more than others. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1618.0s)]
*  But at the core, it's just a family. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1619.0s)]
*  And you know where I really was debating on putting a bit in my Aren't You Embarrassed [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1622.0s)]
*  special about going to an Italian wedding? [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1628.0s)]
*  I felt it was too specific. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1631.0s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1633.0s)]
*  I go, oh, you know, only Italians are gonna get this. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1634.0s)]
*  Should I put it in? [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1636.0s)]
*  But I decided to put it in. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1638.0s)]
*  And that little bit started to generate some popularity. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1640.0s)]
*  I go, oh, wow. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1644.0s)]
*  People are gravitating towards my personal story, my culture, my father. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1645.0s)]
*  Let me dive into this a little bit more because up to that point, it was about Ross for Less, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1650.0s)]
*  Subway, just generic. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1655.0s)]
*  It was generic observational, but very funny. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1657.0s)]
*  And then your personality shines through it. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1660.0s)]
*  But once you started getting really specific about what you were going through, like it's [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1664.0s)]
*  funny, different friends have shared different clips with me, and it's all based on what [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1669.0s)]
*  they're going through, their relate. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1674.0s)]
*  The Jews always send the one about, just let the Italians handle the cater. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1676.0s)]
*  Every Jewish person has seen that bit. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1681.0s)]
*  You know that, right? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1683.0s)]
*  Yeah, that seems to be big in the Jewish community. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1684.0s)]
*  But yeah, it's funny. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1686.0s)]
*  It's funny, interesting hearing these stories from you and the other side because to be [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1688.0s)]
*  honest with you, I was on a, I like the camaraderie the younger group of comedians have with one [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1691.0s)]
*  another. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1698.0s)]
*  I like the, like I said before we started, it's very inspiring that you guys created [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1699.0s)]
*  a whole environment and you seem to be very tight. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1704.0s)]
*  I was tight with some comedians coming up, but then I began to become very kind of insular [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1708.0s)]
*  and family and not really hanging out with a lot of comedians. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1713.0s)]
*  So I wasn't really on the street. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1718.0s)]
*  I didn't know the street vibe. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1720.0s)]
*  I was just doing my own thing, going out, doing my comedy clubs, like alone. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1721.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1726.0s)]
*  And travel with anybody. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1727.0s)]
*  There was no like going out to a diner at two o'clock in the morning. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1728.0s)]
*  It's like you do the set, you go home and then you rot in the room for the rest of the [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1732.0s)]
*  week. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1738.0s)]
*  They don't realize that like earlier when you're on the road, you spend 18 hours a day [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1741.0s)]
*  in the hotel. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1746.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1747.0s)]
*  I mean, there were times where like the first people I spoke to that day were the crowd. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1748.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1755.0s)]
*  I'd be at the fucking Crowne Plaza or whatever it was. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1756.0s)]
*  I'd walk to the club, say hello, and then walk on stage and there's 300 people. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1758.0s)]
*  Hopefully. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1761.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1762.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1763.0s)]
*  And I felt if you left the room, and I don't know how you are with like finances, but [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1764.0s)]
*  again, I'm very responsible. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1768.0s)]
*  You start losing money? [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1769.0s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1770.0s)]
*  You leave the room, it costs you money. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1771.0s)]
*  You make $1,000 a week. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1774.0s)]
*  As soon as you step outside, your pay starts going down. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1776.0s)]
*  What are you spending money on, though, if you're alone in the city? [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1779.0s)]
*  Well, let's say you go to the mall and you're like, oh. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1782.0s)]
*  There's a cologne. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1785.0s)]
*  There's a new cologne. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1786.0s)]
*  There's a beautiful cologne. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1787.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're tempted with purchasing whatever, a shirt or whatever you want. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1788.0s)]
*  So as long as you stay in the room, I feel like you're safe. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1794.0s)]
*  When did you get enough money where you started to release a little of your economic anxiety? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1798.0s)]
*  Or is it still there? [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1808.0s)]
*  It's always going to be there. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1809.0s)]
*  Just the way I was raised. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1810.0s)]
*  Nothing chipped away? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1811.0s)]
*  Listen, do I spend money? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1813.0s)]
*  My wife has that in her. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1817.0s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1821.0s)]
*  Just like. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1822.0s)]
*  Spending money? [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1823.0s)]
*  Let's have a party. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1824.0s)]
*  I love to have parties. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1828.0s)]
*  But the way my wife does parties, the way I do parties are two different things. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1829.0s)]
*  Okay, how so? [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1833.0s)]
*  What is the difference? [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1834.0s)]
*  What's your ideal party? [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1835.0s)]
*  All right, guys, you know what time it is. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1836.0s)]
*  It's time for these prize picks. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1838.0s)]
*  Let me throw them at you. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1839.0s)]
*  These are your Singh locks, which are not necessarily locks. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1840.0s)]
*  They're more or less locks. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1842.0s)]
*  I don't know how my record is doing anymore. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1843.0s)]
*  Money's coming. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1845.0s)]
*  Money's going. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1846.0s)]
*  I'm doing pretty well, though. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1847.0s)]
*  Anyway, my point is your Singh locks Lamar Jackson, more than 218 passing yards. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1848.0s)]
*  He's going up against a Rams secondary. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1853.0s)]
*  They're not that great. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1855.0s)]
*  They're not bad. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1856.0s)]
*  They're playing well. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1857.0s)]
*  But 218 for an MVP candidate. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1858.0s)]
*  That's easy. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1859.0s)]
*  Also, Justin Fields, 199 and a half passing yards. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1860.0s)]
*  I still believe in this guy. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1864.0s)]
*  Maybe I'm an idiot, but I don't think that's a very hard goal to get 200 yards passing. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1866.0s)]
*  And this one, I do feel confident in. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1870.0s)]
*  I think 89 and a half is the target as of this episode. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1872.0s)]
*  I'm telling you, the Eagles secondary beaten up. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1877.0s)]
*  I'm not saying the Cowboys will win, even though I hope badly that they do finally do fucking something to make me happy and stop disappointing me. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1880.0s)]
*  But I think CDLand can eat up that secondary. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1886.0s)]
*  Those are your Singh locks. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1888.0s)]
*  Also, you know what you're doing? [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1889.0s)]

*  PricePicks.com promo code Schultz. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1899.0s)]
*  Let's get back to the show. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1901.0s)]
*  All right, guys, here's the deal. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1902.0s)]
*  Not everything in a bad habit is bad. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1904.0s)]
*  So why don't you just make it a habit? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1908.0s)]
*  Just a little habit. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1911.0s)]
*  Take out the word bad. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1912.0s)]
*  That's where Fume comes in. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1913.0s)]
*  Fume is an innovative, award winning flavored air device that helps you kick that bad habit and replace it with one that's not that bad. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1914.0s)]
*  Because instead of vapor, Fume, this beautiful device right here, uses flavored air instead of electronics. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1920.0s)]
*  It's completely natural. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1926.0s)]
*  And instead of harmful chemicals, which are in that other thing, this uses delicious flavors. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1927.0s)]
*  So you get what I'm trying to say. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1932.0s)]
*  Instead of bad, Fume is good. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1933.0s)]
*  It's a habit that you are free to enjoy and it makes replacing your bad habit easy. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1935.0s)]
*  Your Fume right here comes with an adjustable airflow dial. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1939.0s)]
*  It's designed with movable parts and magnets for fidgeting. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1942.0s)]
*  It's a wonderful thing to play with. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1945.0s)]
*  And it gives your fingers something to do, which is helpful for de-stressing that little sound right there. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1947.0s)]
*  You know, the weird ASMR videos that your wife probably listens to. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1951.0s)]
*  I get it now. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1954.0s)]
*  It's a relaxing thing. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1955.0s)]
*  This is a wonderful way to help reduce anxiety, break your habits. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1956.0s)]
*  You got to try the new Solano Fume right here too. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1959.0s)]
*  This thing is gorgeous. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1961.0s)]
*  Premium walnut barrel. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1962.0s)]
*  Onyx coated mouthpiece. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1964.0s)]
*  Let the boys be boys. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1966.0s)]
*  Slightly softer finish. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1967.0s)]
*  So start the holidays off right with the good habit by going to tryfume.com slash flagrant and getting the journey pack today. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1969.0s)]
*  Again, t-r-y-f-u-m dot com. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1976.0s)]
*  Now let's get back to the show. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1979.0s)]
*  We're going through this right now. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1980.0s)]
*  We had a Christmas party last year. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1981.0s)]
*  We had a plan, a party planner. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1983.0s)]
*  They bring in furniture. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1988.0s)]
*  It's a whole... [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1990.0s)]
*  Which I kind of like because then it doesn't fuck up your furniture and you don't have anxiety about people spilling shit all over. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1991.0s)]
*  I'm into the furniture. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1996.0s)]
*  Yeah, bringing in the furniture. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1997.0s)]
*  But again, furniture is a really high expense when you're dealing with a party. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=1999.0s)]
*  To rent furniture, it's a big dent, right? [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2003.0s)]
*  At the bartender, you got the catering. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2007.0s)]
*  There's a lot that goes into having a Christmas party, at least in my wife's size. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2010.0s)]
*  I said this year, let's do something small. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2016.0s)]
*  Let's have eight, 10 people over at the house. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2020.0s)]
*  We'll get our friend Dom to cater it. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2024.0s)]
*  We'll get some drinks. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2028.0s)]
*  I'll pour them. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2030.0s)]
*  We don't need a bartender. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2031.0s)]
*  But as it starts to go, it's like, all right, next thing you know, there's a truck in the driveway and there's moving people in my house. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2034.0s)]
*  So I like to entertain. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2044.0s)]
*  I really do. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2047.0s)]
*  And if I spend my money on anything, I don't buy cars. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2048.0s)]
*  I don't buy jewelry. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2051.0s)]
*  I buy experiences. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2053.0s)]
*  And if I have experiences with my friends, my family, or it's a vacation, I'd rather spend my money on that than go out and am I going to do it? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2055.0s)]
*  And my home. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2062.0s)]
*  Can you relax at your own party? [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2064.0s)]
*  Yes, I can relax if there is a chef or a bartender there. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2068.0s)]
*  If I'm cooking, I can't relax because I cooked for 14 people last year and it was a complete right. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2076.0s)]
*  You know, my problem is with the cooking. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2084.0s)]
*  I want to make everything. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2086.0s)]
*  I just can't make steak and broccoli. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2087.0s)]
*  I'm making apps. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2089.0s)]
*  I'm making multiple sides. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2091.0s)]
*  Let's start with a pasta. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2095.0s)]
*  And it's only me in the kitchen. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2097.0s)]
*  I got a sous chef that I'm telling him, like, get this out. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2099.0s)]
*  I'm doing everything. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2102.0s)]
*  And my wife is the one who's socializing. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2103.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2105.0s)]
*  So, yes, I can relax if there's help there. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2106.0s)]
*  Do you feel responsible for people socially? [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2109.0s)]
*  Like if somebody's bored at your party, do you feel like, okay, I got to go give them attention? [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2112.0s)]
*  Or are you like, what's wrong with this guy? [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2117.0s)]
*  We curate the party so well. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2119.0s)]
*  That everybody that's there is a good guest list. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2122.0s)]
*  We go, should we invite this couple? [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2130.0s)]
*  Because they would really get along with that couple. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2132.0s)]
*  So we kind of like curate the party. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2134.0s)]
*  So everybody's having a good time. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2136.0s)]
*  Generally speaking, there's no one really in the corner sulking. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2138.0s)]
*  And I'm not the guy to go over there and like boost their spirits. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2141.0s)]
*  I'm there selfishly so I could have a good time. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2146.0s)]
*  You want everybody to have a good time. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2149.0s)]
*  But generally speaking, everybody at my party is happy. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2151.0s)]
*  But how do you deal with the politics of not inviting somebody that may be close to you or your wife? [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2156.0s)]
*  So that's similar to a wedding where you make the cutoff. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2163.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2167.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2168.0s)]
*  So, by the way, I got to ask you something. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2169.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2171.0s)]
*  The mustache. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2172.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2174.0s)]
*  It's not even a question. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2177.0s)]
*  It's just a statement. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2178.0s)]
*  Everybody has facial hair on their face. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2181.0s)]
*  They're like, fuck me. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2185.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2186.0s)]
*  But the only one really playing with it is him. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2187.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2189.0s)]
*  What? [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2190.0s)]
*  What? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2191.0s)]
*  Is this new for me? [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2192.0s)]
*  It took me 40 years to grow. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2193.0s)]
*  So I'm still just making sure it's there. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2194.0s)]
*  I think that's what it is. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2196.0s)]
*  I'm like, I have it. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2198.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2199.0s)]
*  Man, stop. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2200.0s)]
*  Think of all the questions you had about parties. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2201.0s)]
*  I'm ready. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2204.0s)]
*  Alex. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2205.0s)]
*  I'm just constantly, no, no, no, no, tell me. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2208.0s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2210.0s)]
*  It really adds to the interview because how I associate it. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2211.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2215.0s)]
*  I'm locked in. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2216.0s)]
*  I'm locked in. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2217.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2218.0s)]
*  I'm locked in. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2219.0s)]
*  I'm really trying to feel like, oh. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2220.0s)]
*  Let's get to the bottom of this. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2221.0s)]
*  It seems devious sometimes, though, right? [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2222.0s)]
*  He looks like he tied a woman to a train track today. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2223.0s)]
*  There's a little, you know. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2226.0s)]
*  There it is. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2228.0s)]
*  Okay, but break it down. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2229.0s)]
*  How do I cut people off? [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2230.0s)]
*  This is my biggest issue. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2231.0s)]
*  Keep that mustache. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2232.0s)]
*  They won't come. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2233.0s)]
*  With my wife, anytime she wants to make a party for me or anything like that, I go, I [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2234.0s)]
*  can't do a party where there's only eight of us. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2242.0s)]
*  I have so many friends that I would never want to feel left out or whatever. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2244.0s)]
*  So it's like, you have to surprise me and then I'm not responsible if they're not there. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2249.0s)]
*  But you will straight off just cut your friends that you care about and love and you've known [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2254.0s)]
*  for a while. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2258.0s)]
*  Yeah, those people are invited, but there's like fringe friends. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2259.0s)]
*  There's friends with. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2262.0s)]
*  Is Pete at every party? [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2263.0s)]
*  If Pete lived in Los Angeles, he would be at every party. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2264.0s)]
*  Every single party? [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2267.0s)]
*  Every party. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2268.0s)]
*  Okay, his wife is well or he'd know plus one? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2269.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2270.0s)]
*  Pete gets plus one. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2271.0s)]
*  Pete gets plus one. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2272.0s)]
*  Yeah, but there are certain people in your life that there are standards that are going [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2273.0s)]
*  to come to your party. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2276.0s)]
*  But then you have, like, if you had a party, is everybody in this room invited? [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2277.0s)]
*  Everybody's invited. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2281.0s)]
*  Okay, and. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2282.0s)]
*  That blew his fucking mind. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2283.0s)]
*  Even those guys? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2291.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2292.0s)]
*  Behind the scenes? [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2293.0s)]
*  Is there a guy outside? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2294.0s)]
*  We have a guy outside. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2295.0s)]

*  Okay, so. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2298.0s)]
*  He needs someone who's not coming. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2299.0s)]
*  You can't believe it. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2300.0s)]
*  Who's not coming? [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2301.0s)]
*  You can't believe it. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2302.0s)]
*  Yeah, like, do you have comedian friends that you would cut off? [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2303.0s)]

*  tell you what I spent on my 50th birthday party. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2418.0s)]

*  You do a little bit. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2422.0s)]
*  I really don't. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2423.0s)]
*  Just a little bit. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2424.0s)]
*  Just a tiny bit. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2425.0s)]
*  Now that you know that there's a deal involved, I'm a known guy. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2426.0s)]
*  I didn't see your wedding. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2429.0s)]
*  If I saw your wedding and I was invited, because what we do, Italians always try and figure [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2431.0s)]
*  out how much stuff costs anyway, I would go, okay, what do you think he dropped on this? [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2435.0s)]
*  You know the first thing I thought when I came in here? [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2440.0s)]
*  I started trying to figure out how much is the rent here? [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2445.0s)]
*  Or does he own it? [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2448.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2449.0s)]
*  That's the first thing I'm thinking. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2450.0s)]
*  As soon as I walked in, I saw the bikes. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2451.0s)]
*  I know your bikes. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2454.0s)]
*  Does everybody take a bike here? [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2455.0s)]
*  Did I not call this exactly? [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2456.0s)]
*  What did you say, Mark? [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2457.0s)]
*  I said, Sebastian's going to walk in. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2458.0s)]
*  He's going to be like, what, is this a fucking car dealer shit? [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2459.0s)]
*  Motorcycles lined up on the inside of the thing? [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2463.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's just what goes on. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2467.0s)]
*  It is peculiar to have all the bikes inside, right? [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2469.0s)]
*  Are those your bikes? [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2471.0s)]
*  Technically, yeah, but everybody kind of has a bike and they all bring them inside where [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2472.0s)]
*  we all walk around, and that's a lot of the outside, inside, I feel. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2476.0s)]
*  I feel like they could maybe park them outside. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2479.0s)]
*  Well, no, I mean, if you got to, those bikes look expensive. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2481.0s)]
*  Anytime I see a bike that's not a motorcycle, that has a thick wheel like that, I'm thinking [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2485.0s)]
*  that's north of a $1,500, $2,000 bike out there. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2491.0s)]
*  Those are kit bikes. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2493.0s)]
*  Those are kit bikes. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2494.0s)]
*  So I got those for a fraction. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2495.0s)]
*  I'll tell you how much we paid for those. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2498.0s)]
*  He got a kit bike. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2501.0s)]
*  There's an Armenian in Glendale. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2502.0s)]
*  Yeah, he got to that huge discount. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2503.0s)]
*  I'd love a kit bike. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2505.0s)]
*  Can you get me a kit bike? [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2506.0s)]
*  I feel like you could get a lot of things. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2507.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2508.0s)]
*  I feel like- What is that? [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2509.0s)]
*  Sponsor? [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2510.0s)]
*  That's what I thought. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2511.0s)]

*  I thought that. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2521.0s)]
*  Your publicist said he won't come on the pod unless he asks, Yerba mate. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2522.0s)]
*  I said this can't be true. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2526.0s)]
*  It's delicious. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2529.0s)]
*  No, this is a nice touch. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2530.0s)]
*  It's a nice touch that you actually did some homework on me and found my favorite things [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2533.0s)]
*  and had them here. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2542.0s)]

*  I just let that be known. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2557.0s)]
*  He kind of stared right at me. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2558.0s)]
*  He doesn't see color. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2559.0s)]
*  He's not Chicagoan. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2560.0s)]

*  Kind of. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2566.0s)]
*  I don't exactly know. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2567.0s)]
*  I just know that Sicilian people and black people love to dance. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2569.0s)]
*  That is true. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2578.0s)]
*  I have to say, I mean you as a black guy, when you see an Italian on the dance floor, [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2579.0s)]

*  And they didn't at all. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2959.0s)]
*  No. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2960.0s)]

*  No. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2963.0s)]
*  He was just the gravitational force. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2964.0s)]
*  When there's a president in the room. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2965.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2969.0s)]
*  It's amazing how people behave, regardless if you're a Republican or a Democrat. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2970.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2974.0s)]
*  They can't even have a conversation. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2975.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2976.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2979.0s)]
*  And she was sitting down at a table and people couldn't even talk to one another. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2980.0s)]
*  Every conversation was like this. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2984.0s)]

*  Somebody said that about hanging out with Eddie Murphy. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2991.0s)]
*  Everything just stops and everyone's looking at Eddie. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2993.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=2996.0s)]

*  I haven't been in a social environment with him, so I don't know how that works socially. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3003.0s)]
*  And he's so unassuming when he's out and about that you don't even really know it's him. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3008.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3013.0s)]
*  Sometimes I didn't even know it was him. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3014.0s)]
*  When we did the table read, I didn't even recognize him. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3016.0s)]
*  He came in like a little hat. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3018.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3020.0s)]
*  He had a beard and I wouldn't have recognized him on the street or if he was in a restaurant [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3021.0s)]
*  unless somebody told me. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3024.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3025.0s)]
*  But no, I didn't have that with him on set. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3026.0s)]
*  I felt like on set it was like a work environment. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3029.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3031.0s)]
*  And everybody was kind of like in our own little bubble. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3032.0s)]
*  Is he funny at all? [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3034.0s)]
*  In between takes and that kind of shit, like would he bust your balls a little bit? [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3036.0s)]
*  No. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3039.0s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3040.0s)]
*  No. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3041.0s)]
*  I was trying to make them laugh. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3042.0s)]
*  I'm not trying to make anybody laugh. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3043.0s)]
*  No. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3044.0s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3045.0s)]
*  When I'm on doing a movie, that's all I'm concerned about is I got to memorize these lines. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3046.0s)]
*  No small talk. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3051.0s)]
*  No, not a lot of that. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3052.0s)]
*  He would like go to his chair. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3054.0s)]
*  So funny. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3057.0s)]
*  After the scene, I would go to my chair and he would have like a bunch of papers and whatnot. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3058.0s)]
*  He would be on the phone. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3064.0s)]
*  He'd be talking. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3065.0s)]
*  I go, is this guy opening up another notebook? [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3066.0s)]
*  Between scenes? [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3069.0s)]
*  This is your life's work. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3070.0s)]
*  This is the pinnacle of your career. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3071.0s)]
*  This guy's flipping through the fucking times. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3072.0s)]
*  He's looking at the expense reports. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3073.0s)]
*  So I didn't know there wasn't that relationship. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3074.0s)]
*  He's a quiet guy. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3075.0s)]
*  He's a quiet guy. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3076.0s)]
*  He's kind of to himself and he doesn't talk a lot. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3077.0s)]
*  If you talk to him, he'll engage. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3078.0s)]
*  But it's not like he would come to you and say, hey, I'm going to talk to you. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3079.0s)]
*  He's going to talk to you. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3080.0s)]
*  He's going to talk to you. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3081.0s)]
*  He's going to talk to you. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3082.0s)]
*  He's going to talk to you. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3083.0s)]
*  He's going to talk to you. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3084.0s)]
*  He's going to talk to you. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3085.0s)]
*  He's a quiet guy. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3087.0s)]
*  He's a quiet guy. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3088.0s)]
*  He's kind of to himself and he doesn't talk a lot. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3089.0s)]
*  If you talk to him, he'll engage. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3091.0s)]
*  But it's not like he would cut and I'm like, where you going tonight? [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3092.0s)]
*  He's like, I'm 80. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3093.0s)]
*  What about Pesci? [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3094.0s)]
*  Was Pesci a little bit? [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3095.0s)]
*  Pesci, he was very cordial and hey, welcome to the set, nice. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3096.0s)]
*  And then he called me into his dressing room afterwards. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3103.0s)]
*  We spoke in there. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3115.96s)]
*  He was a lot more outgoing. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3116.96s)]
*  We golfed together back in LA. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3119.72s)]
*  So he's definitely more of a kind of a outgoing guy. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3122.3s)]
*  He lived with my grandparents weirdly for like a year. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3126.16s)]
*  Really? [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3129.96s)]
*  He was like a teenager. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3130.96s)]
*  This is in like Montclair, New Jersey. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3131.96s)]
*  I think he grew up out there in like in Montclair. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3132.96s)]
*  How are your grandparents? [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3136.64s)]
*  He was friends with my uncle. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3137.64s)]
*  And I think that, I don't know, he like needed a place to stay or some shit and ended up [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3139.34s)]
*  just kind of like living with the grandparents and my uncle for a little while. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3142.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah, randomly. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3146.8799999999997s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3147.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3148.8799999999997s)]
*  And then just goes and becomes one of the most iconic actors ever. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3149.8799999999997s)]
*  But yeah, they were just like sipping Robitussin for a summer. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3152.48s)]
*  I think back in the day, Robitussin had like the, what is it called? [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3156.8399999999997s)]
*  The amphetamines? [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3163.08s)]
*  Yeah, it had like amphetamines. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3164.08s)]
*  The lean. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3165.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3166.08s)]
*  So you could get kind of like high on it. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3167.08s)]
*  How do you know that? [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3168.08s)]
*  This guy knows everything. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3169.08s)]
*  He knows how to sell fake portions. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3170.08s)]
*  Does a movie set ever get monotonous? [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3171.44s)]
*  Like, are you annoyed being on the set of a movie? [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3174.36s)]
*  It's not, it was not the most fun experience for me. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3177.24s)]
*  What bothers you about? [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3180.24s)]
*  It's, you know, doing stand up, you know, it's like- [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3181.24s)]
*  Can't even compare. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3184.0s)]
*  Can't compare. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3185.0s)]
*  It's so best gig in the world. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3186.0s)]
*  Boring compared to stand up. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3187.0s)]
*  But you still want to do it. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3189.3199999999997s)]
*  Like I understand, I imagine where you're coming from, which is like your whole life, [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3190.52s)]
*  you're watching movies and you're seeing these things come to life. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3193.7599999999998s)]
*  You're like, I have the opportunity to do it with the greatest actors ever. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3196.16s)]
*  And also storytelling, which is what we do in comedy, the pinnacle of storytelling, in [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3199.48s)]
*  my opinion, is through film. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3204.92s)]
*  Like you actually get to fucking see it. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3206.64s)]
*  But while you're making it. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3208.7200000000003s)]
*  But what's more satisfying when it's done, when you're watching it back? [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3211.0s)]
*  That's where you get the satisfaction. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3215.0s)]
*  So you got to kind of keep your eye on the prize going, okay, you got to kind of go through [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3216.64s)]
*  all this. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3220.44s)]
*  And at the end of this, the end product is what you're kind of hoping that turns out [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3221.52s)]
*  fabulous. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3225.92s)]
*  You guys are watching one of your specials when it's done and edited and all that? [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3226.92s)]
*  I even don't even like watching the specials. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3231.16s)]
*  I like the process of doing stand up comedy. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3233.6s)]
*  I don't necessarily like to watch the end product on a special. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3235.96s)]
*  Is it hard doing jokes and everybody on set can't laugh because it fucks up the take? [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3240.16s)]
*  Did you get used to doing jokes to silence? [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3246.2000000000003s)]
*  That was a big problem for me, still is. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3249.64s)]
*  So you would do this scene, right? [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3252.48s)]
*  As a comedian, they yell cut and you're like, where's the standing ovation? [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3255.2s)]
*  We're moving on, moving on. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3261.36s)]
*  There's no feedback. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3264.64s)]
*  No feedback. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3266.56s)]
*  Although doing this new show, Chuck Lorre and Nick Bacay are very good about laughing. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3267.64s)]
*  It's great. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3273.88s)]
*  It's so booky on Macs, by the way. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3274.88s)]
*  Some directors know what comics need and they'll kind of lean in a little bit more to it because [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3280.04s)]
*  we do need... [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3285.32s)]
*  Because there's moments when I came to the screening of the movie about my father, right? [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3286.32s)]
*  And there's moments where you're being big, like the bird thing, the act that you're doing. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3291.52s)]
*  And it was like, I'm imagining you doing that on set and everybody's told to be quiet. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3297.4s)]
*  And then they're going cut and I'm imagining what I would feel in that moment. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3304.72s)]
*  I'm being big and I'm trying to be funny. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3307.92s)]
*  Feel this big. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3309.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3310.92s)]
*  That's where I'm like, oh, let me see if I could reach out here and do something funny [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3311.92s)]
*  or whatever. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3316.04s)]
*  And you do that and then cut and then that's like... [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3317.04s)]
*  The hero takes out the times. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3320.04s)]
*  Silence and an act out is just gross. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3324.04s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3326.04s)]
*  It's no worse. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3327.04s)]
*  You're hoping they yell cut and everybody's like, just holding it in. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3328.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3332.04s)]
*  When you don't hear it, even after the cut, you're like, that died. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3333.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3337.2s)]
*  So, yeah. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3338.2s)]
*  What was the biggest bomb you felt on set? [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3339.2s)]
*  That one. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3341.2s)]
*  That 100%. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3342.2s)]
*  Yeah, that was definite. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3343.2s)]
*  Can you describe the scene for people watching? [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3344.2s)]
*  So I'm like, I'm walking around, me and De Niro are in a bedroom and we're talking about [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3347.2s)]
*  my wife's side of the family. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3354.2799999999997s)]
*  And I think the line was something like, yeah, and they're walking around like birds. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3356.56s)]
*  I'm like, bah-hah! [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3361.36s)]
*  But I'm even watching it, I go, I don't think that's that funny. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3367.36s)]
*  Even I said as I was watching, I go, no wonder I didn't get a laugh. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3371.36s)]
*  That sucked. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3374.36s)]
*  But in the room is just the two of us, so it's him and De Niro and he's going for it. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3377.36s)]
*  And you don't know in the moment, is De Niro going, this is the funniest shit I've ever [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3382.36s)]
*  seen? [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3386.36s)]
*  Is he egging you on? [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3387.36s)]
*  Or is he going, I think he was even going, what are you doing? [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3388.36s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3393.36s)]
*  Why? [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3397.36s)]
*  Why? [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3398.36s)]
*  Why? [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3399.36s)]
*  Because you saw it. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3400.36s)]
*  I'm sure you were sitting in your seat going, what the fuck is that? [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3405.36s)]
*  So, yeah, no, I don't know. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3409.36s)]
*  It was a learning experience that movie did. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3411.36s)]
*  You gotta say your Eddie Murphy one. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3414.36s)]
*  Oh, dude, I bombed so big in front of Eddie. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3416.36s)]
*  Eddie's the reason I did stand up. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3418.36s)]
*  And I had three lines in this movie. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3420.36s)]
*  And I have like one with Eddie. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3422.36s)]
*  And the line, I fuck up seven times in a row. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3425.6800000000003s)]
*  And it's not a scene where there's like six people here and a few cameras. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3428.6800000000003s)]
*  It's in a nightclub with minimum 100 naked strippers dancing around, okay? [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3431.6800000000003s)]
*  And then people fake tipping the strippers, whatever. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3437.6800000000003s)]
*  It's Jonah Hills, Eddie Murphy. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3441.6800000000003s)]
*  And I gotta say a line, and I don't even know what the fucking line is, to be honest with [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3444.6800000000003s)]
*  you. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3448.6800000000003s)]
*  Even to this day, I've like, I blacked it out, PTSD. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3449.6800000000003s)]
*  But it's something like, yeah, you know he was doing coke because he had it all over [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3450.6800000000003s)]
*  the strip in Las Vegas. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3454.0s)]
*  And I go, you know he's on a strip in Vegas? [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3456.0s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3458.0s)]
*  You know he's on a, and I do five in a row, and I finally get it. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3459.0s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, you know he's doing coke, he's doing a strip in Las Vegas. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3462.0s)]
*  And then Eddie is supposed to like kind of play with me. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3465.0s)]
*  He goes, yeah. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3468.0s)]
*  Just, just. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3471.0s)]
*  Bro, pin-shot nothing, okay? [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3473.0s)]
*  I'm sitting there and I'm just like, well, this is everything I've ever dreamed for in [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3475.0s)]
*  my entire life. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3479.0s)]
*  Everyone I've ever worked for, nothing. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3480.0s)]
*  I'm sitting there. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3481.0s)]
*  I'm like, fuck, man. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3482.0s)]
*  I just fucked up my moment. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3483.32s)]
*  Because that day, that morning, I'm going in going, I'm going to kill this line. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3484.32s)]
*  Eddie's going to go, we should go back out on tour. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3487.32s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3490.32s)]
*  Like, it's over. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3491.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3492.32s)]
*  Literally, the next scene, you know, Felipe Esparza. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3493.32s)]
*  Yeah, hilarious comic. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3495.32s)]
*  Felipe comes out. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3496.32s)]
*  He has a line, right? [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3497.32s)]
*  And he comes in, and his line is, hey, man, I got you these things. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3498.32s)]
*  It's the edible arrangements, right? [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3501.32s)]
*  He comes in, he goes, I got you these things, these edible arrangements. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3503.32s)]
*  Eddie's supposed to respond to him. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3506.32s)]
*  He stops the scene. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3508.32s)]
*  He goes, stop. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3509.32s)]
*  He looks at Felipe, he goes, you're fucking hilarious. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3510.6400000000003s)]
*  Stop production. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3515.6400000000003s)]
*  He goes, you're hilarious. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3518.6400000000003s)]
*  That was amazing. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3521.6400000000003s)]
*  Let's do that again. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3523.6400000000003s)]
*  And you're there watching us. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3524.6400000000003s)]
*  I'm sitting there watching, faking tip strippers. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3526.6400000000003s)]
*  And he's doing his line. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3528.6400000000003s)]
*  And Eddie's like, you got to do that again. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3529.6400000000003s)]
*  Just one tear comes down, bro. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3532.6400000000003s)]
*  So you were hoping that he would have said that to you. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3535.6400000000003s)]
*  Of course. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3537.6400000000003s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3538.6400000000003s)]
*  Did you have any banter with him coming into the scene? [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3539.96s)]
*  No, I was so nervous to even, I just hold him to such high regard that I didn't want [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3542.96s)]
*  to make him feel uncomfortable in any way. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3548.96s)]
*  You have so many scenes with De Niro, that doesn't go well in your eyes. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3550.96s)]
*  Are you scared to improv with him after? [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3553.96s)]
*  Yeah, your confidence is a little shot, I think, coming off a physical bit in a movie [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3555.96s)]
*  and they get nothing. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3562.96s)]
*  The next scene, we're like, just stick to the script. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3563.96s)]
*  Stop improvising. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3569.28s)]
*  That was a choice you made at one point. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3571.28s)]
*  It was like, in the moment. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3573.28s)]
*  Comic, we're going for it. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3575.28s)]
*  Can you explain the idea of making a choice in acting? [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3577.28s)]
*  Because I think that's something a lot of people don't get. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3581.28s)]
*  You get a script, but it doesn't tell you physically what else to do. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3583.28s)]
*  There's a story you told about the flick and the pin on Pesci's coat. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3587.28s)]
*  Yeah, well, hell. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3592.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3593.28s)]
*  And it doesn't tell you to do it in the script. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3594.28s)]
*  You start doing stuff in a scene that might not be written in the script. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3597.6000000000004s)]
*  The problem is, if you do not commit, and this is true to stand-up comedy, and I know [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3602.6000000000004s)]
*  this, because I could tell if I don't commit to a bit, it's dead in the water. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3609.6000000000004s)]
*  Same thing with acting. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3614.6000000000004s)]
*  If you do not commit 100% to what you're doing, it comes off as false, fake, people see right through it. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3615.6000000000004s)]
*  And I believe when I was walking around that bedroom like a bird, it wasn't 100% commitment to me. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3622.92s)]
*  Can you show us what that would look like, 100% commitment? [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3631.92s)]
*  Almost like, even just doing it, if you want me to get physical. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3634.92s)]
*  I see it, I see it. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3644.92s)]
*  I didn't even... [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3645.92s)]
*  Nobody did that. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3646.92s)]
*  Nobody did that. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3647.92s)]
*  Nobody did that. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3649.2400000000002s)]
*  That's what I was looking for in the scene. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3650.2400000000002s)]
*  See, I just started to do a little of it, and I'm getting laughs. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3652.2400000000002s)]
*  It wasn't as committed, and it shows. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3657.2400000000002s)]
*  It leads right through the film. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3660.2400000000002s)]
*  You saw it. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3662.2400000000002s)]
*  I was looking at it in the movie theater going, it's not funny. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3663.2400000000002s)]
*  It's not funny. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3666.2400000000002s)]
*  You're tickling your own movie? [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3669.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm telling you. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3672.2400000000002s)]
*  This guy stinks. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3673.2400000000002s)]
*  It sucks. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3675.2400000000002s)]
*  Who is this guy? [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3676.2400000000002s)]
*  For me... [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3677.56s)]
*  Did they yell cut mid-like? [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3679.56s)]
*  Tell me what happens in the scene. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3681.56s)]
*  I think I'm doing that even longer, trying to make something happen. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3684.56s)]
*  There's no way to cut around it? [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3691.56s)]
*  Because you could have cut it out. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3693.56s)]
*  It's your movie. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3694.56s)]
*  Yeah, but even that needed to be in there because I go, is this the best we got? [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3695.56s)]
*  You have grander ideas in your head of how something is going to go, like you and Eddie [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3707.56s)]
*  Murphy. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3713.56s)]
*  You thought that was going to be, oh, this is going to be an amazing scene. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3714.56s)]
*  When it doesn't go as amazing as you'd like it to go, it's A, a learning experience, and [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3717.56s)]
*  B, it's very disappointing. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3722.56s)]
*  But I took all those experiences from that movie and built upon it for the next project. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3724.56s)]
*  That movie I had excruciated... [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3731.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm not making excuses. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3733.56s)]
*  I'm just saying what was going on in my head. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3735.12s)]
*  I had excruciating sciatic pain ripping down my right leg. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3737.2s)]
*  From the bird? [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3741.2s)]
*  No, no, just from life. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3742.2s)]
*  From stress and back issues. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3745.2s)]
*  And I was in Alabama, away from my family, away from my kids for nine weeks, and I was [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3749.2s)]
*  contemplating, what am I doing here? [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3756.2s)]
*  I have two kids, yeah, I'm doing a movie, this is fantastic, but I felt like I was disappointing [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3759.2s)]
*  almost, my family. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3765.2s)]
*  Yeah, two months. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3766.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it was a long time. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3767.2799999999997s)]
*  So, not to say that I wasn't 100% committed, but externally, I wasn't in a good place. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3770.2799999999997s)]
*  Plus, you're on the road for stand-up, every night you know, I crush, so I'm away from [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3777.2799999999997s)]
*  my family, but I know what I just did. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3781.2799999999997s)]
*  Movie, you don't know. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3783.2799999999997s)]
*  I also think that people don't realize, and again, I'm not trying to count your pockets [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3784.2799999999997s)]
*  here, but when someone like you does a movie, when someone like Kevin Hart does a movie, [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3789.2799999999997s)]
*  oftentimes they're losing money, they have to stop touring, hoping that maybe this movie [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3795.36s)]
*  absolutely explodes and you get a piece of it. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3802.36s)]
*  Obviously, I don't know what the financials are right there, but I don't think people [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3805.36s)]
*  realize that. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3808.36s)]
*  I think people just go, oh, movies, everybody makes $20 million a movie, and that's just [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3809.36s)]
*  what it is. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3811.6800000000003s)]
*  It's a labor of love until you're George Clooney. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3812.6800000000003s)]
*  Absolutely, that was, I basically did the movie for free. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3817.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3822.28s)]
*  It was a free, in comparison to what I make doing stand-up comedy, this was like, but [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3823.28s)]
*  you want to broaden your audience. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3829.28s)]
*  Sometimes you want to challenge yourself. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3830.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3832.28s)]
*  Let's see what a movie feels like. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3833.28s)]
*  Let's see what a TV show feels like. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3834.28s)]
*  You kind of got to get out of your comfort zone. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3835.96s)]
*  What do you think with the TV show? [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3836.96s)]
*  In terms of scheduling and lifestyle, easier than the film? [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3839.6400000000003s)]
*  For me it was, because it was in LA. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3844.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3846.48s)]
*  It was with Chuck Lorre. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3847.48s)]
*  Chuck Lorre, maybe give some background on what he's done in television. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3848.48s)]
*  Monster. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3851.6800000000003s)]
*  Two and a half men, Big Bang, Derry, Young Sheldon, Mom. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3853.08s)]
*  He don't need to work anymore. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3857.04s)]
*  Yeah, don't need to work anymore. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3858.04s)]
*  Kaminsky method. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3859.48s)]
*  So he was a joy to work with, and working with someone like that who's got north of [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3861.2799999999997s)]
*  a thousand episodes of TV under the belt, and they're all successful, I felt a lot more [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3867.52s)]
*  comfortable with him in that environment. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3872.56s)]
*  We were in Los Angeles, he knows what he wants, he's quick. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3875.04s)]
*  The whole thing about these TV, it's like you're waiting around. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3879.28s)]
*  Oh, fucking days. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3882.32s)]
*  This was really quick. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3884.0400000000004s)]
*  This was like nine, 10 hour days, which is for that type of stuff, is short, short days. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3887.6800000000003s)]
*  So I had a really, totally different experience doing Bookie than I did the movie. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3893.88s)]
*  Not the Poopoo with the movie, but the- [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3899.92s)]
*  Who else is in Bookie? [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3901.6400000000003s)]
*  Omar Dorsey plays my muscle. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3903.5600000000004s)]
*  Andrea Anders is in it, plays my wife. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3908.24s)]
*  Vanessa Ferlito is my sister. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3910.7999999999997s)]
*  Does your wife get to choose who your wife is, or have a say? [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3913.16s)]
*  No. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3919.24s)]
*  We ran into a little issue when I did a pilot six years ago for NBC. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3920.4799999999996s)]
*  Remember that pilot. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3925.2s)]
*  And Vanessa Lachey was going to play my wife. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3926.6s)]
*  And my wife all of a sudden wanted to get into acting. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3930.12s)]
*  Because I could do it. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3933.9599999999996s)]
*  You could do it. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3937.2s)]
*  So she had like a, there was a little kind of- [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3940.12s)]
*  Think of some jealousy? [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3942.16s)]
*  A little bit. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3943.16s)]
*  Yeah, really. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3944.16s)]
*  A little bit. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3945.16s)]
*  Not necessarily, I just think that's kind of hard to swallow sometimes that your husband [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3946.16s)]
*  is going to have a wife on set. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3952.64s)]
*  There might be a kissing scene. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3954.6s)]
*  I don't blame her. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3957.0s)]
*  And she's fabulous. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3959.68s)]
*  She's so easygoing. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3963.2799999999997s)]
*  But that one little, that was like a little like, I want to do it. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3964.68s)]
*  I want to try acting. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3969.16s)]
*  And that was like- [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3970.48s)]
*  How'd you work that out? [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3971.48s)]
*  I said, you ain't doing that. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3973.16s)]
*  What was her reaction? [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3976.16s)]
*  She got over it. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3982.48s)]
*  I think it was just a small speed bump in the road. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3983.48s)]
*  It was fine. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3988.6s)]
*  Other than that, she's been, since then I've had a couple wives in shows and she doesn't [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3989.6s)]
*  care anymore. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3996.52s)]
*  So your wife on this show is just, she's hot. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3997.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=3999.52s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4000.52s)]
*  If your wife doesn't get insecure, you're like, did we hire the right wife? [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4001.52s)]
*  Should we go a little, what are we doing here? [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4006.52s)]
*  You know what, we ended up becoming good friends with Vanessa and Andrea. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4011.52s)]
*  The wives I've had in these films, Leslie Bibb about my father, we've become like fast [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4017.1600000000003s)]
*  friends with their families. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4023.6400000000003s)]
*  So it's been great. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4025.5600000000004s)]
*  Isn't Charlie Sheen on this one? [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4026.5600000000004s)]
*  Charlie Sheen makes an appearance. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4028.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, Charlie Sheen's- [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4031.1200000000003s)]
*  He's in the trailer. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4032.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4033.1200000000003s)]
*  Chuck Lorre and Charlie Sheen, they kind of parted ways after two and a half. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4034.1200000000003s)]
*  They blow out. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4037.88s)]
*  And this is kind of the reunion of Chuck Lorre and Charlie Sheen. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4038.92s)]
*  So I collect, he plays himself. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4042.38s)]
*  So he's running a poker game out of a rehab facility that he used to go to. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4045.84s)]
*  And he's not in the rehab, he's just running the poker game. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4053.84s)]
*  And I go to collect money because I'm his bookie. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4057.1200000000003s)]
*  And he's in two of the episodes. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4060.0800000000004s)]
*  So- [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4061.32s)]
*  Wait, so how was Charlie? [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4062.32s)]
*  Was he cool? [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4063.32s)]
*  He's cool. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4064.32s)]
*  Great, great guy, very humble, very quiet, very quiet, very professional. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4065.32s)]
*  I mean, this guy's been acting, God knows, 40 years. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4069.92s)]
*  Sober? [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4073.2000000000003s)]
*  Running line, yeah. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4074.2000000000003s)]
*  He's back in- [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4075.6s)]
*  He was a joy. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4076.6s)]
*  Did he reflect it all in that time where- [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4077.6s)]
*  No, never brought up. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4080.08s)]
*  Wait, so you didn't, when you're hanging with him, I know as a comedian, there's part of [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4082.48s)]
*  you that's like, just fucking tell me. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4087.2799999999997s)]
*  I ain't that guy. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4089.56s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think he's that guy. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4091.56s)]
*  You couldn't look at my mustache without bringing it up. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4093.48s)]
*  But that's different. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4096.32s)]
*  I know, but this is, we're talking about like a, this guy is traumatic point in his life. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4097.32s)]
*  I'm not gonna bring that back up. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4101.84s)]
*  You're like a really good point. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4104.4800000000005s)]
*  You're like, you can bring your mustache. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4105.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I'm a crazy person. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4107.4800000000005s)]
*  I think that's what we realized after that moment right there. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4108.4800000000005s)]
*  You're right, thank you. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4111.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, no, there was no mention of that. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4112.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm too kept to- [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4115.4800000000005s)]
*  Profession. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4116.4800000000005s)]
*  I feel like, yeah, for you, private lives are private lives and that's what's important. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4117.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, whatever you do is your business. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4120.4800000000005s)]
*  But also what a great idea because who's not gonna at least tap into one episode outside [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4121.4800000000005s)]
*  of your fans? [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4126.68s)]
*  Your fans are gonna show up, but the world that doesn't know or doesn't care yet to see [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4127.68s)]
*  your show, but it's like, what is Charlie Sheen up to? [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4132.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4135.68s)]
*  It's gonna tap in. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4136.68s)]
*  Yeah, you would think. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4137.68s)]
*  And he's a stud acting-wise. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4138.68s)]
*  He's great. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4139.68s)]
*  He's great. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4140.68s)]
*  And where did the character come from, the bookie? [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4141.68s)]
*  Was it your creation? [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4143.12s)]
*  Was it Chuck? [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4144.12s)]
*  No, not in Chuck. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4145.12s)]
*  Chuck and Nick Bacay. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4146.12s)]
*  Nick Bacay was a writer who is involved in gambling. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4147.360000000001s)]
*  He's involved in that world. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4152.360000000001s)]
*  He likes to gamble and he knows the ins and outs of bookies and whatnot. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4153.360000000001s)]
*  They said, hey, I pitched him a story about my life. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4157.72s)]
*  But then I'm like, I said, pitch it. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4161.64s)]
*  I really wanna be me again. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4164.0s)]
*  Can I pitch you something real quick that might already have been made, but I think [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4166.08s)]
*  it's the wildest story. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4169.76s)]
*  This is one I told you about. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4171.64s)]
*  World War II, America has to go and kind of fuck up Italy a little bit. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4175.360000000001s)]
*  They have to find a way to enter Europe. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4182.0s)]
*  that the Italian mob in Sicily is very against Mussolini. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4185.96s)]
*  So they connect with Lucky Luciano in New York and ask if they can get help from the [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4192.12s)]
*  Italian mob to map out Sicily so they can invade from the south. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4198.0s)]
*  So the mob in New York and Sicily helps the American army enter Italy and rid it of the [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4204.1s)]
*  tyrant that is Mussolini. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4210.96s)]
*  Imagine a mob movie where you can root your movie. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4211.96s)]
*  You're rooting for the mob. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4213.96s)]
*  Like, how has this not been made? [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4214.96s)]
*  Now, and this might show my ignorance. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4216.96s)]
*  Is this a true story? [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4219.96s)]
*  This is a true story. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4221.96s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4223.96s)]
*  This is a true fucking story. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4224.96s)]
*  And I'm like, there's all these fake mob stories. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4226.96s)]
*  You have the craziest real mob story that involves real dude like Lucky Luciano. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4228.96s)]
*  I'm pretty sure it's Lucky, right? [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4233.96s)]
*  He started the mafia. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4234.96s)]
*  He's a real fucking guy. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4235.96s)]
*  They get to be the pseudo good guys during this. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4236.96s)]
*  It does sound like a story like an Italian uncle made up though, right? [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4239.96s)]
*  You know, we killed the Nazis, right? [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4242.96s)]
*  We got them at it. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4245.96s)]
*  You know, we ended World War II. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4246.96s)]
*  Really? Is that true? [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4248.96s)]
*  I mean, how is that? [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4249.96s)]
*  Isn't that like an amazing? [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4250.96s)]
*  I think it's a fabulous story. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4251.96s)]
*  And I think I'm surprised you wasted the pitch here. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4252.96s)]
*  Cut it. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4256.96s)]
*  Cut that into Charlie Sheen. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4257.96s)]
*  Cut both of those. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4258.96s)]
*  Take that. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4259.96s)]
*  Keep the bar. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4260.96s)]
*  Is this real time? [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4261.96s)]
*  We're live. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4262.96s)]
*  Operation Husky is what it was called. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4263.96s)]
*  I had no idea. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4268.96s)]
*  But that is a great premise for a movie. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4269.96s)]
*  I like it. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4271.96s)]
*  You should cut that out though. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4272.96s)]
*  And you should pitch that. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4273.96s)]
*  Cut it out. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4274.96s)]
*  We sell it together, guys? [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4275.96s)]
*  We sell it. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4276.96s)]
*  We go in together. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4277.96s)]
*  We take it there. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4278.96s)]
*  We need an Italian to help us. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4279.96s)]
*  I'll just be there and he could do the pitch and I'll just be there as the Italian. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4280.96s)]
*  The sky's the most appropriate Sicilian culture. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4284.96s)]
*  So we need some warm blood in there. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4287.96s)]
*  Did you have to talk to real bookies for this role? [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4290.96s)]
*  I asked Chuck, should I do a deep dive? [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4293.96s)]
*  Because I'm like, I want to be collaborative and whatnot. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4296.96s)]
*  He goes, no, don't don't don't don't don't. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4299.96s)]
*  We want you. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4302.96s)]
*  We want you. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4303.96s)]
*  Not what a traditional bookie. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4304.96s)]
*  How much of you did you feel comfortable bringing onto this? [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4305.96s)]
*  A lot. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4308.96s)]
*  A lot. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4309.96s)]
*  I mean, I play a very sympathetic bookie. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4310.96s)]
*  I'm not out to break legs and bust heads. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4312.96s)]
*  But yeah, he wanted more kind of my take on it. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4317.96s)]
*  Not so much. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4321.96s)]
*  Yeah, I researched a little bit about bookies and talked to people who use bookies. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4322.96s)]
*  I've never used a bookie before, but it was interesting to find out a bookie in this particular landscape of how he's navigating possible pending doom of the state of California, legalizing gambling. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4327.96s)]
*  Where does that leave him? [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4339.96s)]
*  So and I also like the fact that we go into a lot of different areas in Los Angeles, like we're collecting money from a trust fund kid. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4341.96s)]
*  We're collecting money from a housewife, a college kid and everybody in between. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4349.96s)]
*  So it takes you into a lot of different environments where it's like, oh, OK, this is this is cool and in place to my comedy because it's observe and get a chance to play a lot with with the environment. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4353.96s)]
*  That's really smart. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4366.96s)]
*  Yeah, there was a show called High Maintenance. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4367.96s)]
*  It was like a really successful web series that HBO did where we delivery guy went to a bunch of different houses. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4368.96s)]
*  And this is that but more interesting. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4373.96s)]
*  It's a bookie, which is just all automatically. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4375.96s)]
*  This is something I cause does a lot. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4378.96s)]
*  It's like when you have this great idea that you think is unique, he just likes to remind you that it's been done before. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4379.96s)]
*  Yeah, this is he does this five times a month, but this is better. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4384.96s)]
*  I was shocked when I said that thing about World War Two. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4389.96s)]
*  He wasn't. Oh, yeah, that was already done. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4392.96s)]
*  Indians did that a long time ago. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4394.96s)]
*  That's how we got the British out of that. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4396.96s)]
*  Yeah, that was a little creepy how hard I inhaled. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4398.96s)]
*  But this actually this soap right here, Dr. Squatch, smells fantastic. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4402.96s)]
*  I'm not even lying. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4406.96s)]
*  Let me tell you something. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4407.96s)]
*  I've been a body wash guy for a long time. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4408.96s)]
*  I'm back on the bar soaps. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4410.96s)]
*  I don't use washcloths because it's only my bar soap. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4412.96s)]
*  I have my own bathroom. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4414.96s)]
*  Basically means my wife won't let me use the better bathroom. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4416.96s)]
*  But whatever it is, what it is anyway, I swear to you, I am using Dr. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4420.96s)]
*  Squatch. I'm using a different one. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4423.96s)]
*  I'm using the rum one because I can't drink, but this gets me as close as I can. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4425.96s)]
*  But this right here, birchwood breeze, smells fantastic, as do most of their soaps. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4428.96s)]
*  And it is made of 98 percent natural stuff, which means they don't have any harmful ingredients. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4432.96s)]
*  If you look at the back of most soap stuff or body wash stuff, you don't know what the hell's going on back there. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4436.96s)]
*  This 98 percent natural Dr. Squatch soap will have you looking, smelling and feeling your best in and out of the shower. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4441.96s)]
*  Again, I love that birchwood breeze. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4447.96s)]
*  The holidays are coming up. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4449.96s)]
*  Get you a box of that right now and some other scents. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4451.96s)]
*  You can get stocking stuffers. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4454.96s)]
*  You know how Americans do stockings and they stuff them with stocking stuffers? [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4455.96s)]
*  I've never done stocking stuffers, but if I did, I would absolutely stuff stockings with Dr. Squatch. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4458.96s)]
*  And right now, Dr. Squatch is offering a huge saving to our listeners. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4463.96s)]
*  They've never done this before. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4468.96s)]
*  All customers will get three free bar soaps plus free shipping with any purchase of three bars. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4469.96s)]
*  So you buy three, you get three for free. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4476.96s)]
*  You might not need soap for the rest of the goddamn year, quite frankly, the way this Dr. Squatch lasts. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4478.96s)]
*  Body wash you go through super quickly. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4483.96s)]
*  Fucking luffa's probably disgusting. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4484.96s)]

*  Let's get back to the show. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4589.96s)]
*  You used to be into gambling a little bit, right? [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4590.96s)]
*  Yeah, I used to gamble. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4592.96s)]
*  Would you get you throw it out a little bit? [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4593.96s)]
*  The only reason I was gambling, my reason for it was while I was working at the Four Seasons Hotel, I did not like necessarily waiting on tables. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4595.96s)]
*  I got burned out. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4605.96s)]
*  So when I would go to Vegas, I would gamble hoping I would win so I could take off work and concentrate more on stand up. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4607.96s)]
*  Obviously that didn't work. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4616.96s)]
*  I didn't win. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4618.96s)]
*  But later I found out the only way you really leave a casino with money is performing there. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4621.96s)]
*  And that's the route I went. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4628.96s)]
*  What was your game when you played? [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4630.96s)]
*  Blackjack and Wheel of Fortune. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4631.96s)]
*  The best game. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4637.96s)]
*  Breakdown Wheel of Fortune. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4640.96s)]
*  The Wheel of Fortune slap machine. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4643.96s)]
*  How much you throw it in per game? [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4646.96s)]
*  It was I think $3 to get the spin. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4649.96s)]
*  And back then when you're making a grand a week at a comedy club, $3 is a lot of money. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4654.96s)]
*  That's up. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4660.96s)]
*  So that was my game. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4661.96s)]
*  And there was a machine at Treasure Island that used to pay in the loose. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4663.96s)]
*  Next time I went in there, they remodeled the whole thing. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4671.96s)]
*  They were onto. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4674.96s)]
*  Of course I tried to find it. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4676.96s)]
*  And I lost everything. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4679.96s)]
*  What was the most you were ever up to? [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4681.96s)]
*  I left Las Vegas and again this is pittance with $1,500 and I thought I was loaded. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4683.96s)]
*  I thought man, they're going to have to close it down. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4691.96s)]
*  Oh yeah, that was it. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4696.96s)]
*  There was nothing big. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4698.96s)]
*  Are you into fights at all? [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4699.96s)]
*  Are you into boxing? [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4701.96s)]
*  I love boxing. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4702.96s)]
*  I have never been to a live UFC or boxing match and it's one of my bucket lists to do. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4703.96s)]
*  When do you want to go? [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4709.96s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4710.96s)]
*  Yeah, we need to go. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4711.96s)]
*  I need to go. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4712.96s)]
*  I mean we're going to have to make some cuts, right? [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4713.96s)]
*  Not everybody's going to be invited. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4715.96s)]
*  Well, let's say if you call me up and say hey, I got tickets to go to see, name the fighter. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4717.96s)]
*  Is everybody in the room going? [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4725.96s)]
*  That's the weird thing about me is that yeah, and it makes it really hard. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4729.96s)]
*  So we're rolling like Wu Tang Clan. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4734.96s)]
*  Oh, you come deep. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4738.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4739.96s)]
*  Okay. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4740.96s)]
*  See if I called you, I said let's go out to dinner or let's go to an event. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4741.96s)]
*  It's just me and you. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4745.96s)]
*  My wife's not even, I show up with my wife, you're like, what are you doing? [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4746.96s)]
*  Who invited her? [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4751.96s)]
*  If it's a couple thing. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4752.96s)]
*  You'll tell us. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4754.96s)]
*  I'll let you know. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4756.96s)]
*  But yeah, it's nice that you incorporate everybody. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4758.96s)]
*  It's nice. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4761.96s)]
*  No. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4762.96s)]
*  It's cute, right? [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4763.96s)]
*  It's cute that he does that. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4764.96s)]
*  But even if you get invited to something that he's going to and you find out everybody's [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4765.96s)]
*  going, do you go, everybody's going? [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4770.96s)]
*  Loses the allure for me. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4772.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4774.96s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4775.96s)]
*  So I shouldn't invite him? [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4776.96s)]
*  We're all going to UFC thing and he's like, yeah, I got everyone tickets. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4777.96s)]
*  I'm like, oh my God. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4779.96s)]
*  That's very nice. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4780.96s)]
*  That's very nice. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4781.96s)]
*  You're very inclusive. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4782.96s)]
*  Have you always been like that? [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4783.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4784.96s)]
*  You're a very kind of outgoing guy. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4785.96s)]
*  I think it's more just like, I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings or make them feel [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4787.96s)]
*  like they're not a part of it. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4791.4s)]
*  Okay. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4793.46s)]
*  So if you had your choice, not everybody would go. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4794.46s)]
*  You just feel bad. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4797.96s)]
*  You feel bad. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4799.96s)]
*  No? [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4801.96s)]
*  In my mind, I thought I was being the good guy in that moment and you just exposed what [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4802.96s)]
*  a piece of shit I am. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4806.96s)]
*  He's being soft. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4807.96s)]
*  Yeah, he's like, oh, if I don't invite him, they're going to be mad at me. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4808.96s)]
*  Right? [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4812.96s)]
*  I want them to feel like they're not an equal part in this. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4813.96s)]
*  But he doesn't get that. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4816.96s)]
*  He'll get two seats ringside. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4817.96s)]
*  He gets to be right there. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4819.96s)]
*  And then instead it's all seven of us in the middle, in the back, because he'd rather have [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4820.96s)]
*  more seats in the back than the two up front. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4824.96s)]
*  And I'm looking at him like an idiot, like, dude, just take the better seats. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4826.96s)]
*  Okay. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4828.96s)]
*  So you would sacrifice your own pleasure of watching something for the betterment of the [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4829.96s)]
*  table. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4833.96s)]
*  He doesn't want to go with you anymore. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4834.96s)]
*  Unless my wife is there, and because she won't sacrifice her watching enjoyment. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4835.96s)]
*  I was like, yeah, we could just sit in a shittier place, but we'll all sit together. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4840.96s)]
*  And she'd be like, why? [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4843.96s)]
*  Yeah, she wants the front row. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4845.96s)]
*  No, it's very commendable. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4847.96s)]
*  I like your style in that way. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4848.96s)]
*  I wish I could be more inclusive like that and invite a lot more people. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4850.96s)]
*  But I'm just not like that. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4854.96s)]
*  I like a tight, tight group. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4855.96s)]
*  Tight, tight. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4857.96s)]
*  Eight tops? [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4858.96s)]
*  Eight. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4859.96s)]
*  I said two, me and somebody else. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4860.96s)]
*  That's it. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4866.96s)]
*  No, there is a number though of like a dinner, for example. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4867.96s)]
*  There's a number where it breaks off into so many little conversations. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4871.96s)]
*  It's like, why are we all eating together? [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4875.96s)]
*  Do you know what I'm talking about? [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4877.96s)]
*  Like, what is it? [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4879.96s)]
*  Maybe six. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4880.96s)]
*  When they start making you the prefix meal because you went, you know, over eight. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4881.96s)]
*  It's a long table, not a round table. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4885.96s)]
*  Yeah, we're not all hanging out. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4887.96s)]
*  Like, you know what I'm saying? [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4889.96s)]
*  Like it's an eight top round, which I think is a good Italian. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4890.96s)]
*  The Chinese, they get it right. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4894.96s)]
*  You go eight top round and they have the thing spinning. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4895.96s)]
*  Everybody could talk to everybody. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4898.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4899.96s)]
*  It's perfect. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4900.96s)]
*  When you go long. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4901.96s)]
*  You go long, you only got this person here, right and left, and maybe a couple of diagonals. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4903.96s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4908.96s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4909.96s)]
*  But I feel round is a little... [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4910.96s)]
*  Be honest, when you go out and you see a long table, do you jockey? [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4912.96s)]
*  I leave. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4914.96s)]
*  Andrew leaves too. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4919.96s)]
*  He's got the prereq. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4920.96s)]
*  No, must have backs. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4921.96s)]
*  Oh, that's the other thing. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4922.96s)]
*  I don't do like... [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4923.96s)]
*  A communal table picnic. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4924.96s)]
*  If it's a bench with no back, I leave the restroom. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4926.96s)]
*  That bothers me. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4929.96s)]
*  I need a back to a seat. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4930.96s)]
*  I'm at a point where my back muscles are not strong enough for me to just sit upright for a whole dinner. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4932.96s)]
*  And also digest. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4938.96s)]
*  The whole thing. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4939.96s)]
*  It is ruined if there's not a back. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4940.96s)]
*  If it's a tall stool for me and no back, I'm not sitting on a tall stool. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4942.96s)]
*  That's my job. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4946.96s)]
*  You could just do a bar stool for dinner. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4947.96s)]
*  Oh, no, no. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4949.96s)]
*  I don't know if I would go as far as leaving the restaurant if there was no back. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4951.96s)]
*  No other option. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4956.96s)]
*  On the seat. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4957.96s)]
*  Yeah, well, it depends. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4958.96s)]
*  If you and your wife go out and there's no back on the seat, are we just... [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4959.96s)]
*  We're eating at home. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4962.96s)]
*  Okay. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4963.96s)]
*  Or we're going to another restaurant. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4964.96s)]
*  Okay. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4965.96s)]
*  Or I have to find a wall next to the end of the bar. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4966.96s)]
*  And that's my back. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4971.96s)]
*  Wow. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4972.96s)]
*  Well, it's good that you know what you want, right? [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4973.96s)]
*  Support this. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4974.96s)]
*  I can't. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4975.96s)]
*  You support it? [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4976.96s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4977.96s)]
*  Really? [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4978.96s)]
*  I can't believe that you would tolerate such a thing. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4979.96s)]
*  Well, the restaurants I generally pick, they're not... [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4980.96s)]
*  Pick, pick, pick. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4985.96s)]
*  No, some foodie spots will do this. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4989.96s)]
*  And you're like, what are we doing? [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4992.96s)]
*  Have you been to Tokyo? [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4995.96s)]
*  Have you been to Japan? [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4997.96s)]
*  I have been to Japan, but on a USO tour, not for a vacation. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=4999.96s)]
*  Okay, so no sushi. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5004.96s)]
*  You didn't do it... [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5005.96s)]
*  Well, yeah, we didn't do the whole... [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5006.96s)]
*  You would now. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5008.96s)]
*  You didn't go out and go out. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5009.96s)]
*  No, at the time, no, I did not go out. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5011.96s)]
*  Why is it... [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5014.96s)]
*  I had... [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5015.96s)]
*  I mean, I went with my wife. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5016.96s)]
*  We had amazing sushi. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5017.96s)]
*  And... [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5019.96s)]
*  But there's a place that I would recommend avoiding that you might want to frequent if [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5020.96s)]
*  you hadn't spoken to me first. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5025.08s)]
*  You know the Jiro guy from Jiro Dreams of Sushi? [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5027.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5030.44s)]
*  That was the worst sushi we had. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5031.44s)]
*  Really? [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5032.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5033.96s)]
*  Almost inedible. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5034.96s)]
*  Really? [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5035.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5036.96s)]
*  It was in the kitchen? [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5037.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5038.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5039.96s)]
*  No good. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5040.96s)]
*  Hard to find. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5041.96s)]
*  Hard to find. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5042.96s)]
*  Hard to get in. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5043.96s)]
*  Hard to get in? [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5044.96s)]
*  How'd you get in? [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5045.96s)]
*  Like, what do you do internationally to get into a joint like that? [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5046.96s)]
*  Do you got to go through? [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5051.2s)]
*  Are you involved in that? [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5052.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh, this guy. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5053.4800000000005s)]
*  Let me tell you something. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5054.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5055.64s)]
*  This guy, there is no door that cannot be opened. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5056.64s)]
*  It is one of the most amazing things watching him amoeba into whatever he needs to be in [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5063.84s)]
*  order to get us where we need to go. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5069.84s)]
*  I mean... [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5072.4800000000005s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5073.4800000000005s)]
*  You haven't even, you haven't even seen anything like this. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5074.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, give me like an example. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5078.12s)]
*  I mean, the Jameel example when you guys are at the place in London, you remember this? [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5080.12s)]
*  I wasn't even there. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5085.04s)]
*  Which one is this? [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5086.04s)]
*  This is something he told me. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5087.04s)]
*  Okay, great. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5088.04s)]
*  Or me, study abroad with you. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5089.04s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5090.84s)]
*  This goes back to when we were kids. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5092.16s)]
*  We were in Paris, 21 years old. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5093.16s)]
*  I go to visit him in Paris. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5094.92s)]
*  He goes, listen, the way you get into nightclubs here, there's an old lady that's at the door [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5096.16s)]
*  for every nightclub, right? [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5100.76s)]
*  And he goes, if I look at you, just nod and smile. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5102.16s)]
*  I go, what are you going to say? [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5106.0s)]
*  He goes, don't worry about it. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5107.48s)]
*  If I look at you, you just nod and smile, right? [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5108.48s)]
*  We go up, there's like fucking eight guys. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5110.84s)]
*  There's like, we should never be in this fucking nightclub. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5112.8s)]
*  He goes, he starts schmoozing. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5115.04s)]
*  He speaks French. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5116.32s)]
*  He's talking to the old lady. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5117.32s)]
*  And I just go, walk in. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5119.96s)]
*  Takes us to some table. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5122.84s)]
*  I'm up there, everybody's dancing. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5124.2s)]
*  All of a sudden the owner of the nightclub comes and walks over, right? [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5125.2s)]
*  And he's like, he goes, hey man, thank you so much for coming. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5128.44s)]
*  This means so much to us that you would be here. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5131.84s)]
*  And I'm like, all right. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5133.8s)]
*  And he goes, and congratulations about your movie. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5134.8s)]
*  I'm like, okay. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5138.08s)]
*  And I find out he told them that I was Ashton Kutcher. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5139.5199999999995s)]
*  So I'm, no, fuck you. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5146.2s)]
*  I'm sitting there with the owner the whole night [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5147.5199999999995s)]
*  because he's just fucking yapping in my ear [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5149.16s)]
*  while he's out here trying to take down chicks [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5152.16s)]
*  to his horrible little. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5154.04s)]
*  Which I did, thank you. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5155.12s)]
*  Anyway. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5156.639999999999s)]
*  But is that premeditated? [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5157.48s)]
*  You go in to these. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5158.719999999999s)]
*  He's flexible. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5159.919999999999s)]
*  You have to figure out what they want, what they need. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5161.04s)]
*  You know how Floyd just figures it out in the ring? [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5162.879999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5164.96s)]
*  That's this guy. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5165.799999999999s)]
*  And I've seen him do it across the board. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5166.639999999999s)]
*  What's the Jameel thing in London? [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5167.5199999999995s)]
*  The Jameel thing is a similar thing, [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5168.879999999999s)]
*  but it's the Olympics in London. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5170.04s)]
*  And he goes up to the door and he goes and looks at Jameel. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5171.32s)]
*  Jameel's a taller black dude with dreads. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5173.639999999999s)]
*  And he's going, Jameel just waves. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5175.36s)]
*  Same exact thing. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5176.72s)]
*  Told Jameel he was a runner. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5177.56s)]
*  He was a professional runner. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5179.400000000001s)]
*  Olympic athlete. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5180.240000000001s)]
*  Olympic athlete. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5181.08s)]
*  We had our passes from viewing the Olympics, [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5181.92s)]
*  but it looked official. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5183.400000000001s)]
*  And I'm the Jewish guy next to a cool looking black guy. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5184.68s)]
*  And I'm like, you did this with Jameel? [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5188.240000000001s)]
*  I managed him and he's on the four by 400. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5189.88s)]
*  You can't pick the specific event. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5192.12s)]
*  You have to be part of the relay team [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5193.88s)]
*  so that they're not gonna, no, that's supposed to be. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5195.52s)]
*  This is the move. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5197.56s)]
*  This is the move. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5198.400000000001s)]
*  He does this. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5199.240000000001s)]
*  He'll Google who the owner is, right? [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5200.06s)]
*  And when he goes and talks to the maitre d', [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5202.200000000001s)]
*  it's just word salad. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5204.12s)]
*  He's not even making complete sentences, [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5205.56s)]
*  but he'll get the owner's names, right? [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5207.68s)]
*  And he'll be like, hey, how you doing so much? [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5209.68s)]
*  Yeah, we're just sent from Miami and Art Basel [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5211.88s)]
*  and obviously this whole F1 thing is such a debacle. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5214.280000000001s)]
*  David Lucas told me to come by in any way. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5217.160000000001s)]
*  He just buzzwords, buzzwords, buzzwords. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5219.240000000001s)]
*  And they're in a fucking tailspin. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5221.72s)]
*  They have no clue what to do. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5223.4400000000005s)]
*  And they just go fine table. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5224.92s)]
*  You never see anything like this. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5226.4400000000005s)]
*  You have to confuse. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5227.4400000000005s)]
*  When you're dealing with somebody, [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5228.280000000001s)]
*  you don't even speak the language. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5229.120000000001s)]
*  That you go at the hotel. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5230.400000000001s)]
*  The hotel does everything. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5231.400000000001s)]
*  The hotel, okay. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5232.240000000001s)]
*  That shit is hard to get into. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5233.080000000001s)]
*  Over there, things are hard to get into for them. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5234.92s)]
*  But when you're just at a hotel, [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5237.44s)]
*  you tell the concierge and they want foreigners to go. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5238.92s)]
*  It was probably the easiest reservation to get. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5241.36s)]
*  But it do not go. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5243.84s)]
*  It was 22 minutes, $500. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5244.84s)]
*  Oh, it wasn't $500. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5247.679999999999s)]
*  A thousand? [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5249.4s)]
*  Because you have to buy a blazer. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5250.24s)]
*  Oh, that's why I bought a suit to go [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5252.32s)]
*  because I read all the rules. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5253.599999999999s)]
*  And they're like, you have to respect this. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5255.4s)]
*  It's tradition. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5256.679999999999s)]
*  We didn't drink alcohol there. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5257.679999999999s)]
*  We didn't even talk to each other. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5258.88s)]
*  It was awful. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5260.88s)]
*  I hate that sushi shit. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5262.0s)]
*  You don't talk. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5263.16s)]
*  It's just sitting at the bar. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5264.0s)]
*  That's a date night. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5264.96s)]
*  That's terrible. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5265.8s)]
*  I wanted it. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5266.84s)]
*  Here, you don't have that. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5267.68s)]
*  Here, we do whatever. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5268.64s)]
*  Even the sushi bars where it's just a bar [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5269.48s)]
*  and it's not really tabled. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5271.16s)]
*  I'm not sitting next to you like it's fucking lunch. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5272.08s)]
*  They're not a talkative bunch, the Japanese, [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5274.12s)]
*  when they eat. I know. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5276.0s)]
*  I know. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5276.84s)]
*  Get what they do. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5277.68s)]
*  They don't like to chop it up about what's going on. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5278.5s)]
*  No. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5280.92s)]
*  They speak Japanese. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5281.76s)]
*  You don't. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5282.72s)]
*  You know what? [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5284.96s)]
*  They might be talking. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5285.8s)]
*  That is a good point. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5286.64s)]
*  No, we would go and see the people on dates there [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5288.36s)]
*  and they'd just both be on their phones. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5290.2s)]
*  Oh. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5291.44s)]
*  Yeah, they're a quiet culture. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5292.28s)]
*  Quiet culture. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5294.5199999999995s)]
*  And they're very neat. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5295.36s)]
*  I like Japanese people. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5296.179999999999s)]
*  Very neat and very systematic. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5297.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, that's a big thing for you. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5298.88s)]
*  I like organization. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5299.719999999999s)]

*  Absolutely. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5303.759999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5305.04s)]
*  We cleaned up for you. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5305.88s)]
*  Do your kids do the rents and that though? [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5311.2s)]
*  You're so organized. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5312.16s)]
*  I'm not that organized. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5313.0s)]
*  I play it up. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5314.84s)]
*  It's not like I got matching sock drawer and whatnot. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5315.679999999999s)]
*  I mean, yeah, they're organized, but no, you're organized. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5319.719999999999s)]

*  You know, you've seen that. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5345.08s)]

*  No, you know, the only thing I had to do was, [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5367.96s)]
*  and I don't even know if this is even bad, [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5371.96s)]
*  but they put a blindfold on me. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5373.84s)]
*  Oh boy. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5376.719999999999s)]

*  and they told us it was glass. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5382.200000000001s)]
*  And that was like a little mind trick. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5385.4400000000005s)]
*  And then they... [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5388.68s)]
*  Did you react and say, I'm not doing this? [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5390.160000000001s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5398.84s)]
*  I ended up coming to the president of fraternity. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5399.96s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5402.080000000001s)]

*  I was a little bit more like, [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5411.08s)]
*  I pitched a computer lab room. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5412.719999999999s)]
*  I said... [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5415.12s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5415.959999999999s)]

*  for a fraternity president. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5417.639999999999s)]
*  I was in a fraternity, this is how our president was. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5418.879999999999s)]
*  Same thing. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5420.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so we were in a party house. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5421.44s)]

*  we're doing for after hours. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5424.919999999999s)]
*  Buy three computers, we don't have to go down [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5426.759999999999s)]
*  to the library and use the computers, [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5428.5599999999995s)]

*  Fuck that, we ain't doing that. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5431.759999999999s)]
*  And the computer room was never a thing. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5435.24s)]
*  I got voted down. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5438.839999999999s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5566.16s)]
*  Yeah, we were out there. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5567.0s)]
*  Abu Dhabi. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5568.88s)]
*  Abu Dhabi, yeah, I don't know what. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5570.04s)]
*  Are you doing that one? [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5572.52s)]
*  No, no, I don't know what it was. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5573.4s)]
*  Recently it came in. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5576.36s)]
*  But before I go there. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5577.4800000000005s)]
*  We've priced ours on yours. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5578.32s)]
*  Whatever you're paying, Sebastian, [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5580.879999999999s)]
*  I need to make 15% off. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5582.28s)]
*  I was the model. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5583.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but I like to dig in, like, who's been there? [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5588.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, what was their average ticket price [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5591.599999999999s)]
*  when they were there? [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5593.5599999999995s)]
*  I like to figure out where you price yourself [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5594.4s)]
*  and what the demand is. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5600.16s)]
*  But I mean, live shows right now are through the roof. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5602.32s)]
*  I mean, if you look at what Ed Sheeran, [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5605.16s)]
*  Taylor Swift and Beyonce. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5606.919999999999s)]
*  I think everybody's locked in for COVID. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5608.5199999999995s)]
*  And now they feel like they're free to go out. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5610.8s)]
*  When does that end? [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5612.8s)]
*  When does that dip off? [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5613.8s)]
*  I think it's starting a little bit. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5615.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5616.28s)]
*  A little bit, and not dip off to zero, [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5617.12s)]
*  but I think it's like. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5618.88s)]
*  The market is cooling a bit. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5620.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it will just regress back to like a good solid place. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5621.76s)]
*  And I think those people that have audiences [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5626.0s)]
*  won't feel it as much as maybe people [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5628.599999999999s)]
*  that haven't built in like a real core fan base. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5631.24s)]
*  I would agree with you. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5634.16s)]
*  But you know, I mean, the one arena is. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5635.8s)]
*  I mean, after your tour, it will. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5637.16s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5640.04s)]
*  After the tour, you just announced. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5640.88s)]
*  Then your tour will probably be the last one [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5641.72s)]
*  is what I suspect. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5644.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5645.64s)]
*  No, it'd be interesting. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5646.4800000000005s)]
*  It'd be interesting to see. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5647.4400000000005s)]
*  It's just because, you know, [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5649.280000000001s)]
*  it's a lot of pressure to come up with material. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5650.8s)]
*  That's the thing. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5655.120000000001s)]
*  Like you don't, well, you have a podcast, [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5655.96s)]
*  but it's not like a source of your life's income. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5658.200000000001s)]
*  Like you can't just, your podcast is broke. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5662.96s)]
*  I'm trying to say. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5667.5599999999995s)]
*  It is. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5669.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5670.759999999999s)]
*  Fortunately, you make the most money ever doing comedy [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5671.599999999999s)]
*  so you can afford these amazing things that you do. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5674.16s)]
*  But for us, we can make a living on the pod [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5676.799999999999s)]
*  and then it puts less pressure on, [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5681.5599999999995s)]
*  okay, I gotta get a new hour ready to go by this time. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5683.36s)]
*  Okay, I'm gonna ask you a question. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5686.4s)]
*  Talk to me. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5687.4s)]
*  You guys do this podcast. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5688.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5689.759999999999s)]
*  Is there a secret. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5690.599999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5691.759999999999s)]
*  To the podcast. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5693.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5694.839999999999s)]
*  Okay, you guys are all funny. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5696.64s)]
*  You have a great comradery. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5698.360000000001s)]
*  You have guests on. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5699.400000000001s)]
*  Is it the guests? [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5701.16s)]
*  What do you think makes a successful podcast? [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5702.64s)]
*  The bikes by the sofa. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5706.08s)]
*  Yeah, the bikes are huge. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5707.200000000001s)]
*  The bikes are huge. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5708.240000000001s)]
*  Well, besides the bikes and the guru you got sitting. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5709.08s)]
*  Our main success of being serious is the fact [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5712.280000000001s)]
*  that we don't have Pete Coriali on the podcast. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5714.96s)]
*  I think that's what makes, [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5718.4800000000005s)]
*  I think that's what makes, just ours. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5721.64s)]
*  That's just ours. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5723.400000000001s)]
*  I can't, I don't. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5724.72s)]
*  Love you, Pete. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5725.92s)]
*  You're the fucking man. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5726.76s)]
*  But no, I think it's like, obviously you gotta take a seat. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5727.6s)]
*  You guys were doing Zoom for a while. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5730.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5732.12s)]
*  You can't do Zoom. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5732.96s)]
*  Nobody wants to watch a fucking Zoom anything. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5733.8s)]
*  Right, like I don't wanna watch a news interview on Zoom. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5735.52s)]
*  I don't wanna see anything on Zoom ever. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5737.56s)]
*  Okay. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5739.88s)]
*  Even if it's like war news, I'm just like, oh, it's Zoom? [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5740.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5743.56s)]
*  Get out there, buddy. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5744.400000000001s)]
*  Totally agree with you. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5745.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5746.08s)]
*  Totally agree with you. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5746.92s)]
*  But our podcast was almost like this. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5747.76s)]
*  We've been doing it for 10 years. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5749.8s)]
*  Pete's been in some place else. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5751.400000000001s)]
*  I've been, so we just, [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5752.76s)]
*  it wasn't really, [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5754.36s)]
*  it was something, it was like a hobby almost. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5756.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5758.0s)]
*  But then we started to really kinda get into it. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5758.84s)]
*  I go, yeah, let's try in studio stuff. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5760.92s)]
*  Let's try some guests. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5764.599999999999s)]
*  Let's see what happens there. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5765.679999999999s)]
*  I mean. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5767.32s)]
*  It immediately changed, huh? [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5768.16s)]
*  It not, not that it like skyrocketed, [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5769.599999999999s)]
*  but we have a spike in listeners. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5773.679999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5776.44s)]
*  And there's nothing better than in-room contact. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5777.28s)]
*  Like if I was phoning this thing in on the screen, [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5781.64s)]
*  it's just not for me. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5784.88s)]
*  You couldn't smell me. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5785.72s)]
*  I couldn't smell you. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5786.56s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of stuff that happens. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5787.400000000001s)]
*  The laugh is in a delay and all this other stuff. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5788.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5790.400000000001s)]
*  The audience can feel it. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5791.240000000001s)]
*  But also the cool thing is that you get to work from home, [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5792.6s)]
*  you're around your family, you know what I mean? [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5796.68s)]
*  It's just one of those things where you don't have [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5798.88s)]
*  that pressure to, oh shit, I need a new hour by February. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5800.200000000001s)]
*  So I, let's go, cause this tour starts here [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5804.08s)]
*  and I gotta fucking go. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5806.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5807.68s)]
*  You can do that whenever the hell you want to. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5808.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5809.360000000001s)]
*  You know? [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5810.200000000001s)]
*  But it is difficult to come up with. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5811.32s)]
*  How the fuck are you coming up with a new hour? [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5813.28s)]
*  Well, I gotta live. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5815.92s)]
*  That's why I took some time off. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5816.76s)]
*  I was constantly on the road, this and that. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5818.32s)]
*  I had no time to even live my life to extract any material. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5822.32s)]
*  So I said, you know what? [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5826.2s)]
*  Let me take a beat here. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5827.36s)]
*  Let me concentrate on other things, [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5829.28s)]
*  whether it be a TV show, the podcast, [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5830.96s)]
*  let me spend some time with my family. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5832.76s)]
*  Smart. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5834.08s)]
*  And I was talking to Chris Rock about this [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5834.92s)]
*  and he kind of put it, he goes, [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5836.96s)]
*  there's no way you could make an entrance [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5839.24s)]
*  if you never leave the room. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5842.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5843.84s)]
*  And I. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5844.679999999999s)]
*  Get slapped a bit. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5845.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5846.34s)]
*  Is that his advice? [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5847.179999999999s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5848.0199999999995s)]
*  I didn't hear that. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5848.86s)]
*  I didn't know where he was going with that. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5849.679999999999s)]
*  I was like, that's a handle. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5851.5199999999995s)]
*  But yeah. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5853.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta live. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5856.36s)]
*  You gotta have something to talk about. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5857.2s)]
*  Live a life worth talking about. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5858.36s)]
*  There's a thing that sometimes you see comics doing [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5859.679999999999s)]
*  with it as part of the joke they're referencing when they, [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5862.5599999999995s)]
*  one time I did this in Alabama [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5866.88s)]
*  and then this happened and every time I see it, [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5869.64s)]
*  I'm like, oh, you're not living a life outside of comedy. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5871.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5874.0s)]
*  Like the only things that are happening to you [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5874.84s)]
*  that are worth talking about are the other things [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5876.68s)]
*  that are happening in comedy. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5879.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5880.08s)]
*  And people don't do comedy. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5880.92s)]
*  They don't do comedy. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5882.04s)]
*  They live life. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5882.88s)]
*  They live life, yeah. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5883.72s)]
*  I agree. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5884.56s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta extract from real life experiences. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5885.4s)]
*  So this one right now, this tour that you're announcing, [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5888.24s)]
*  tickets are on sale. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5891.52s)]

*  Yeah, Ticketmaster and it's for July. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5894.6s)]
*  And this one, you were telling me before, [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5898.44s)]
*  this is about just how insanely rich you are and like, [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5899.96s)]
*  right, didn't you say like, [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5903.8s)]
*  No, I didn't have to say that. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5905.12s)]
*  You were like, I have so much money now. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5905.96s)]
*  So now I get to tell everybody. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5908.12s)]
*  Paul, I've stopped being relatable. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5909.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I see. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5910.72s)]
*  I didn't say Paul. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5911.5599999999995s)]
*  You guys won't get it. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5912.92s)]
*  Is that what this? [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5914.28s)]
*  His Elton Jenner Tower. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5915.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5916.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5917.68s)]
*  No, you're not, you're not, [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5920.5199999999995s)]
*  you don't have money until you start parking bikes [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5922.04s)]
*  in your living room. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5924.36s)]
*  Right? [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5925.2s)]
*  Right? [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5926.04s)]
*  That's really a real success. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5927.72s)]
*  Okay, so they can go check out the tour. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5930.0s)]
*  They check out the show. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5931.96s)]
*  The show is available on Max. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5933.08s)]
*  Now it's called Max. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5934.6s)]
*  We knew it as HBO Max before that. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5935.96s)]
*  Now, anybody who has HBO Max, [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5938.72s)]
*  obviously you're gonna check out the show. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5941.24s)]
*  Max, I guess HBO owns the company. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5943.36s)]
*  Break it down, what happened with that? [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5946.0s)]
*  What is going on? [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5949.0s)]
*  It's Max. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5950.28s)]
*  I don't think there is an HBO anymore. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5951.12s)]
*  I think it's just a rebrand. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5953.32s)]
*  So HBO is within Max. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5954.4s)]
*  Within the Max family, although it's a Max original. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5956.92s)]
*  I don't think, don't quote me on this. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5961.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5963.0s)]
*  I don't think HBO is around. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5965.0s)]
*  It's there on the platform, [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5967.12s)]
*  but I don't think that it's a HBO show anymore. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5970.04s)]
*  Like HBO ain't putting out any more shows. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5973.36s)]
*  It's on the Max, I think. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5975.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't know. Interesting. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5976.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think the name is just Max. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5977.719999999999s)]
*  It was HBO Go before that. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5979.08s)]
*  HBO Max, now it's just Max. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5980.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5983.36s)]
*  Discovery owns them, and that's why they changed to Max. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5985.04s)]
*  Now you can get Discovery shows on Max also. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5987.8s)]
*  I was wondering why they did that. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5989.92s)]
*  And then HBO might come back as like, [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5991.88s)]
*  okay, it's still a great property for high end movies. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5994.5599999999995s)]
*  Or Game of Thrones comes out or something like that. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=5997.96s)]
*  They're still doing original production. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=6000.599999999999s)]
*  They're just rebranding the house. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=6002.5599999999995s)]
*  That's a lot. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=6004.4s)]
*  Who's that? [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=6005.24s)]
*  That's Scott. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=6006.36s)]
*  That's Scott. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=6007.96s)]
*  He's invited, you'll see him at dinner later. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=6008.8s)]
*  You have any questions you wanna ask him? [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=6010.8s)]
*  I'm good, I'm good, geez. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=6013.2s)]
*  Okay, listen, Sebastian, thank you so much for coming. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=6014.76s)]
*  Thanks for having me, guys. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=6016.72s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=6017.5599999999995s)]
*  Unbelievable what you've accomplished, man. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=6018.4s)]
*  Looking forward to more accomplishments for you. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=6020.04s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=6021.88s)]
*  You're the man, bro. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=6022.72s)]
*  Thank you so much. Thank you. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchAi55WTqs&t=6023.5599999999995s)]
