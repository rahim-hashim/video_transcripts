# Billy Carson Reveals Alien Encounter & Lost Civilization Secrets
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [April 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A)
*  I come home, I'm looking at ESPN. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=0.0s)]
*  All the lights turn dim, the TV turns off, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1.7s)]
*  and I thought my kids were playing a trick on me. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3.96s)]
*  I look up and there's nobody there. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5.88s)]
*  When I turn around, there were these two beings right there. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7.8s)]
*  And, whew. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=11.1s)]
*  Man, hard. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=13.84s)]
*  Whoa, sorry. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=14.68s)]
*  And, uh. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=15.52s)]
*  They had the big almond eyes like you see on TV. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=16.72s)]
*  I swear they did. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=18.86s)]
*  I felt like my brain was shaking in my skull [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=19.7s)]
*  to the point where it started hurting [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=21.64s)]
*  and I started screaming, but no sound was coming out. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=22.62s)]
*  A few seconds later it stops. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=25.32s)]
*  They don't walk like a person, they kind of dangle. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=26.76s)]
*  And they went right through the wall, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=29.76s)]
*  and then, whoo, the TV comes back, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=31.2s)]
*  the lights come back to normal color. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=33.72s)]
*  It was just traumatic for everybody. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=35.34s)]
*  I basically lost my whole family over this. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=37.36s)]
*  I kept hearing this voice in my head over and over again. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=39.68s)]
*  Finally, the next day I got so tired of this, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=42.92s)]
*  I couldn't stop this noise, this phrase. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=44.6s)]
*  So I go to my computer. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=47.28s)]
*  First thing popped up was [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=48.68s)]
*  .org and I almost fell out of my chair. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=50.86s)]
*  What's up, everybody? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=53.86s)]
*  Welcome to Flaker. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=54.86s)]
*  Today we are joined by the holder of Forbidden Knowledge, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=55.86s)]
*  Billy Carson. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=59.86s)]
*  We are getting to the bottom of all the conspiracies. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=60.86s)]
*  We got Antarctica, ancient civilizations. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=63.379999999999995s)]
*  We got the pyramids. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=66.38s)]
*  We got black dick length. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=67.86s)]
*  And Billy Carson is gonna fill us all in. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=69.53999999999999s)]
*  No ditty. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=73.14s)]
*  End of story. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=74.34s)]
*  I'm gonna go to the bathroom. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=75.18s)]
*  I'm gonna go to the bathroom. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=76.98s)]
*  I'm gonna go to the bathroom. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=77.82s)]
*  I'm gonna go to the bathroom. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=78.66s)]
*  I'm gonna go to the bathroom. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=79.48s)]
*  I'm gonna go to the bathroom. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=80.32s)]
*  I'm gonna go to the bathroom. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=81.14s)]
*  I'm gonna go to the bathroom. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=81.98s)]
*  Indulge. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=83.58s)]
*  Take us back to Anunnaki. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=84.41999999999999s)]
*  What are they? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=86.74s)]
*  Are these giants? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=88.25999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=89.1s)]
*  Okay, the Anunnaki, they are these beings [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=89.91999999999999s)]
*  that came from off world. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=92.53999999999999s)]
*  So these are aliens? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=94.53999999999999s)]
*  These are aliens. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=95.58s)]
*  Now what's interesting about these aliens [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=96.69999999999999s)]
*  is that they're not little green men with antenna. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=99.41999999999999s)]
*  They're actually hominids. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=102.1s)]
*  Bilateral bipedal hominids, they look just like us. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=103.74s)]
*  You slice them in half, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=107.02s)]
*  they have two four-faced looking eyes, two hands, legs. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=107.85999999999999s)]
*  They put their pants on one leg at a time like us. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=110.86s)]
*  But they look more like us or more like us? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=113.7s)]
*  Us. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=117.1s)]
*  They look like, we look like them. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=117.94s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=120.9s)]
*  We actually look like them. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=121.74s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=122.7s)]
*  And the reason why is because we have their genetics [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=123.53999999999999s)]
*  and their DNA inside of our bodies. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=124.98s)]
*  Now what's interesting is these beings [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=127.2s)]
*  were a space-faring race that broke away [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=129.22s)]
*  from the Pleiadian star system. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=132.94s)]
*  The Pleiadian star system is a group of stars [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=135.2s)]
*  called the Seven Sisters in the night sky. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=137.7s)]
*  You can see six stars with the naked eye. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=140.18s)]
*  Now these stars in ancient times, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=142.54000000000002s)]
*  according to ancient texts and tablets, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=144.24s)]
*  there was an ancient galactic war there. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=146.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=148.5s)]
*  Most of the information from Star Wars comes from this text. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=149.34s)]
*  And this war, they had these destroyers like Death Stars. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  They don't call them that, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=157.54000000000002s)]
*  but they call them the Brahma Astra [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=158.38s)]
*  and Brahma Astra Honda weapons [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=160.3s)]
*  that actually can release a weapon that can destroy planets. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=162.58s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=166.82s)]
*  Imagine if you were in a star system [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=167.66s)]
*  and a planet is being blown up [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=168.84s)]
*  and you're on a nearby planet. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=170.52s)]
*  You gotta get off of your planet. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=172.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=174.32s)]
*  This created something called space refugees. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=175.16s)]
*  Nobody's talking about this. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=178.1s)]
*  Where are you getting this information again? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=180.0s)]
*  Where is it? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=181.32s)]
*  The Mahabharata, the Bhagavad Gita, the Indian Vedas. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=182.16s)]
*  So these are ancient Indian texts. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=184.28s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=186.68s)]
*  5,000 years ago. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=187.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=188.34s)]
*  And the Enuma Elish, which is Sumerian. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=189.18s)]
*  Oh, and I wanna get to this, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=191.2s)]
*  but for this entire episode, we're not fact checking. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=192.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=195.52s)]
*  Checking, okay. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=196.36s)]
*  We're not debating, we're not pushing it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=197.2s)]
*  Take us down the rabbit hole. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  We wanna see how deep it goes. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  The people can listen to what I'm saying [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=201.76s)]
*  and they can go look all of it up. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=203.2s)]
*  Fuck them. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=204.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=205.39999999999998s)]
*  Take us down the rabbit hole, Billy. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=206.23999999999998s)]
*  I'm taking you, man. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=208.2s)]
*  Okay, let's go. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=209.04s)]
*  So we're talking about- [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=210.04s)]
*  Yes and. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=211.16s)]
*  We're talking about the evidence, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=212.0s)]
*  the very first evidence of space refugees. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=214.32s)]
*  So you're seeing this in these ancient Indian texts. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=219.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=220.76s)]
*  You come across this and you're like, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=221.57999999999998s)]
*  okay, let me see if there's some truth to this [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=222.83999999999997s)]
*  because I'm seeing this across multiple ancient Indian texts. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=224.23999999999998s)]
*  Any other texts referencing this? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=227.6s)]
*  The terror papers, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=228.84s)]
*  an ancient indigenous American text as well. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=229.76000000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=233.8s)]
*  Very little known texts that hardly anyone talks about. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  The Hopi tribe elders have written this book [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=237.44s)]
*  based on that text and published it actually. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=241.28s)]
*  It's called the terror paper. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=243.76000000000002s)]
*  So that it wasn't just in indigenous lore, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=245.0s)]
*  but it made it finally to publishing. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=248.52s)]
*  So it's actual texts that we can all read and get access to. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=250.08s)]
*  It reads like the Star Wars movie. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=252.72s)]
*  Just take out the love stories and all that. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=255.08s)]
*  And what's interesting is it talks about, again, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=257.2s)]
*  these same galactic wars going on. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  People fleeing from that region of space, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=262.12s)]
*  looking for other planets, Orion, Aldebaran, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=265.04s)]
*  Sirius A, B and C, which we know the Dogon talk about, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=269.08000000000004s)]
*  people coming from Sirius B, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  which is a star that ran out of fuel. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=273.6s)]
*  And of course, earth. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=276.12s)]
*  And they came here to create a breakaway civilization. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=277.44s)]
*  Just like if there was a war, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=280.6s)]
*  and there was in our solar system, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=282.16s)]
*  that's what we call Mars, God of War, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  we're gonna be like, you know, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=286.58000000000004s)]
*  we gotta get off this planet [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=287.48s)]
*  because the debris is going to destroy us. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=288.52000000000004s)]
*  So we're the product of pussy aliens, basically. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=290.48s)]
*  Like aliens who weren't ready to bang [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=294.84000000000003s)]
*  and fight for their future and their freedom. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=296.92s)]
*  They just ran. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=298.78000000000003s)]
*  We're defectors. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=299.62s)]
*  They were the elites that had the access to the ships [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=300.46000000000004s)]
*  that can take them from one star to another. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=304.16s)]
*  So are they like the politicians [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=306.76s)]
*  that like didn't go to Vietnam? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=308.40000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=309.64s)]
*  God, so yeah, we're the product of rich, privileged kids. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=310.48s)]
*  We're the guys with the $10,000 suit [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=313.32000000000005s)]
*  that just sent everyone out to die. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=314.88000000000005s)]
*  They would be protesting at Columbia, right? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=316.20000000000005s)]
*  Correct. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=317.6s)]
*  Got it. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=318.44s)]
*  Okay, good, good, got it, got it, got it. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=319.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's who these people are. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=321.08000000000004s)]
*  And so some of them came to earth. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=323.04s)]
*  And so Anunnaki is a general term. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=324.48s)]
*  It doesn't mean one race. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=326.72s)]
*  It's just like if all of us here got in a spaceship [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=328.92s)]
*  and flew to Mars and we met a Martian, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=331.28000000000003s)]
*  and he said, who are you guys? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=333.48s)]
*  We'd say earthlings. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=334.72s)]
*  Got it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=336.08000000000004s)]
*  But they maybe would call us Anunnaki. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=336.92s)]
*  Yeah, I wouldn't say I'm Billy Carson from Fort Lauderdale. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=338.64000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=340.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=341.72s)]
*  So they're earthlings. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=343.04s)]
*  That's one term, but we're all different races here. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=343.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=345.92s)]
*  Right? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=346.76s)]
*  So Anunnaki is a term to say those who came [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=347.6s)]
*  from heaven to earth, that's it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=351.52s)]
*  In Africa, they call it the Nituuru, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=353.44s)]
*  which means the same exact thing. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=355.36s)]
*  The gods that came from heaven to earth [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=357.04s)]
*  and turned mud into a kingdom. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=358.44s)]
*  Now the civilization they built [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=360.32s)]
*  is the Atlantean civilization. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=361.8s)]
*  So this is where we hear about Atlantis, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=364.08s)]
*  the mythology of Atlantis. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=366.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=367.56s)]
*  Got it, okay. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=368.4s)]
*  They built the Atlantean civilization. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=369.24s)]
*  And where's the evidence for this? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=370.08s)]
*  Where do you read about that? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=373.28s)]
*  Well, if you look in the text, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=374.12s)]
*  well, a lot of the Indian texts, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=376.32s)]
*  the Vedas, the Mahabharata, the Bhagavad Gita, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=378.04s)]
*  the ancient lore of the indigenous Aboriginals, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=381.56s)]
*  the terror papers, the Enuma Elish, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=385.08s)]
*  the Epic of Atra-Hasis, the Code of Hammurabi, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=388.52s)]
*  the Mithabhatana, there's so many tablets [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=391.88s)]
*  I can just keep going down, down, down. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=394.2s)]
*  Everybody's referencing the Atlantean civilization. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=395.56s)]
*  Obviously the most popular one is, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=398.88s)]
*  was it Plato's uncle or something like that? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=401.04s)]
*  Oh, Plato, Plato wrote about that. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=404.44s)]
*  Oh, he did? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=405.84s)]
*  Yes, he did. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=406.68s)]
*  Okay, got it, got it, got it, got it. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=407.5s)]
*  And so you start looking at this information, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=408.92s)]
*  that was more recent. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=412.32s)]
*  When I say recent, it's not as ancient. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=413.68s)]
*  But Plato's account of Atlantis is not that ancient. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=416.2s)]
*  But we're talking about the Ring City, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=420.76s)]
*  but that was just one capital. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=424.08s)]
*  So that Ring City that was being described [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=426.2s)]
*  is one capital of dozens that existed [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=429.08s)]
*  on Earth at the same time. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=431.32s)]
*  Do we know where these other ones might be? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=433.44s)]
*  Is there any remnants of it? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=435.84s)]
*  They were on every continent, every single continent. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=436.68s)]
*  We're standing on Atlantis right now. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=439.71999999999997s)]
*  We're sitting right on top of Atlantis. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=441.94s)]
*  It was New York. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=443.44s)]
*  Yes, everyone on this planet is on top of Atlantis. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=444.36s)]
*  So when you start to look at the Americas, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=448.34s)]
*  you discover that there were so many pyramids [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=452.44s)]
*  in the Americas, there were literally thousands of them. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=455.32s)]
*  What happened to them? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=457.91999999999996s)]
*  The Catholic Church blew up the tops of these pyramids [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=459.76s)]
*  and built churches on top of them. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=462.40000000000003s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=464.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=464.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=465.68s)]
*  Come on, bro. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=466.5s)]
*  Hold on, hold on, hold on. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=467.34000000000003s)]
*  I was raised Catholic, they never told us that. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=468.96000000000004s)]
*  No, no, they won't tell you that. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=470.88s)]
*  Give me a sip. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=471.72s)]
*  That is great. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=472.56s)]
*  That's how it get going. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=473.40000000000003s)]
*  They didn't tell you guys a lot. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=475.72s)]
*  Hold on, hold on, hold on. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=478.04s)]
*  So break this down, break it down. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=478.96000000000004s)]
*  There were pyramids everywhere. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=480.56s)]
*  How did the Catholics find out about it? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=482.64s)]
*  Are they reading the ancient texts? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=483.88s)]
*  Oh no, they just know it. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=485.36s)]
*  We gotta eradicate this civilization science [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=486.92s)]
*  because we want to impose our will on the people. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=489.28000000000003s)]
*  See, the Catholic Church went through something [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=493.72s)]
*  called the Inquisitions. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=495.32s)]
*  It was the Papal Inquisitions [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=497.0s)]
*  where they went around the planet [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=498.52000000000004s)]
*  and they killed and tortured and murdered 80 million people [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=500.44s)]
*  to convert them into Christianity. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=504.8s)]
*  And so it wasn't spread like they tell you in church, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=507.36s)]
*  the gospel means the good news. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=510.52000000000004s)]
*  It was really bad news when these people showed up. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=512.6800000000001s)]
*  It would be like America showing up to your country [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=514.6s)]
*  and you have oil buried in the ground. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=517.76s)]
*  Really? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=518.6s)]
*  It's bad. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=519.44s)]
*  Wow, so they were like giving women fucking rights and shit [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=520.2800000000001s)]
*  all the time, read. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=522.64s)]
*  Absurd. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=525.2s)]
*  What the fuck is wrong with these people, man? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=528.0400000000001s)]
*  If you go to the museum in Rome, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=530.72s)]
*  you'll find they still have the torture tools [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=533.12s)]
*  there in the museum. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=534.76s)]
*  They're proud of them. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=535.96s)]
*  They have the Pope's spear. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=537.08s)]
*  The Pope's, yeah, spear, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=538.9200000000001s)]
*  which went up in a woman's vagina. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=540.2s)]
*  I saw that one. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=542.0400000000001s)]
*  Pop them open from the inside. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=543.24s)]
*  They had a spire that they would lower a man down [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=545.16s)]
*  into the spire through his butthole over and over again, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=548.3199999999999s)]
*  up and down, up and down until he died. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=551.28s)]
*  Damn, no diddy, bro. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=552.8399999999999s)]
*  For real. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=554.88s)]
*  They just had all these torture mechanisms. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=556.8399999999999s)]
*  What they would do is get the leader, the king, the chief, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=559.5999999999999s)]
*  the guy who does all the sage and all that stuff, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=565.64s)]
*  the medicine man. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=569.24s)]
*  And then they would say, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=570.76s)]
*  look, we need to convert everyone into this. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=571.9599999999999s)]
*  And if you don't, they're gonna kill you. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=574.84s)]
*  Fuck you from the inside out. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=576.4000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=577.24s)]
*  So they would make everyone. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=578.08s)]
*  Who would do the fucking, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=578.9200000000001s)]
*  because I feel like that would be against Catholicism. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=579.9200000000001s)]
*  It was to be one of these people from their church system [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=582.84s)]
*  and be like, hey, this is my job. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=586.12s)]
*  So there was a fucker. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=586.96s)]
*  There was a guy who would have that. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=587.96s)]
*  There was a guy who'd connect you [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=588.8000000000001s)]
*  and get you lined up perfectly and do that. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=590.5600000000001s)]
*  Sick people. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=595.08s)]
*  But they were these people. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=595.9200000000001s)]
*  Do what you gotta do. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=596.7600000000001s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=597.7600000000001s)]
*  You gotta spread the gospel. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=598.7600000000001s)]
*  You gotta spread the gospel. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=599.7600000000001s)]
*  You gotta spread the gospel. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=600.7600000000001s)]
*  You gotta spread the gospel. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=601.7600000000001s)]
*  You gotta spread the gospel. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=603.2s)]
*  You gotta spread the gospel. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=604.04s)]
*  You gotta spread the gospel. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=604.88s)]
*  It is the good word. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=605.72s)]
*  Under the order of Rome. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=606.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=607.64s)]
*  But the thing Rome said was, look, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=608.48s)]
*  we gotta get this money. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=610.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=611.36s)]
*  So what we're gonna do is we're gonna get out, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=612.2s)]
*  convert our pagan system into a Christian system. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=614.68s)]
*  We're gonna combine the two together. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=617.92s)]
*  That's why we have all these fake holidays [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=619.56s)]
*  that are all pagan holidays in Christianity. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=621.24s)]
*  That's my man, Constantine, right? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=623.48s)]
*  Yeah, Constantine. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=624.8s)]
*  They just combined it all together. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=625.64s)]
*  Now we got the taxes and we got the offerings. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=627.04s)]
*  We got both. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=630.16s)]
*  And now we got the people unified [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=631.0s)]
*  and now we can put our boot on everybody's neck. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=634.4s)]
*  And so once they reeled up the leader of that village [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=636.8s)]
*  or that town and killed them like that, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=639.56s)]
*  and everyone saw it, it was like, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=641.64s)]
*  okay, I'm ready to learn now. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=643.12s)]
*  Teach me your language. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=644.48s)]
*  Show me, talk to me about your God. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=645.72s)]
*  By the second, third generation, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=647.68s)]
*  you're born, you're given a name, a race and a religion, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=650.44s)]
*  and you don't even know who you are. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=653.4s)]
*  Wow. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=654.84s)]
*  So do you know which church in America [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=655.88s)]
*  or which churches are on Old Pyramids? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=657.72s)]
*  I know, you just have to go and just go out there. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=660.12s)]
*  See, anything on, most of the older ones that are on hills [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=662.2s)]
*  with the tryptic windows, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=665.0400000000001s)]
*  the tryptic windows are the same windows [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=667.12s)]
*  that mimic the three windows [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=668.8000000000001s)]
*  that you see in a lot of the pyramids, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=670.72s)]
*  like in Chichen Itza, Yucatan Peninsula and all of that. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=672.44s)]
*  Those older ones, if you go to Mexico City, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=675.44s)]
*  how I learned this, I went to Mexico City. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=677.32s)]
*  I got a homegrown archeologist. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=678.88s)]
*  He started showing me all the hills [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=680.88s)]
*  and all the old, old churches. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=682.36s)]
*  He said those were all pyramids. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=684.9200000000001s)]
*  So it's wild, like when you go [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=686.36s)]
*  to the Mexico City Pyramids specifically, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=687.5999999999999s)]
*  they show you what it looked like before [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=690.7199999999999s)]
*  and what it looked like after. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=692.64s)]
*  You can never look at a hill again [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=695.16s)]
*  and not think it's a pyramid after you go see it. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=697.56s)]
*  In fact. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=699.8s)]
*  So if, go look at it, you can see not Chichen Itza. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=700.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's the tryptic, yes. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=703.8399999999999s)]
*  Ah, wow. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=705.16s)]
*  At the top of all Catholic churches, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=706.0s)]
*  with the older ones, they all have that tryptic design. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=707.16s)]
*  And most of the ones that are old in 1800s [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=710.56s)]
*  built on those hills were pyramids. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=712.28s)]
*  Go to the Mexico City Pyramids and do it before excavation. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=713.4799999999999s)]
*  Because what happens is grass just starts to grow on them. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=717.0799999999999s)]
*  So they just start to look like terrain hills. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=719.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, hills. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=721.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they just look like hills. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=723.28s)]
*  And people have all these explanations for it. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=725.1999999999999s)]
*  My tour guide, yeah, look at that. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=727.5999999999999s)]
*  So if you just saw that, that black and white picture, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=729.4s)]
*  to the right, right there, yeah. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=732.0s)]
*  Tell me that you would never look at that [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=733.9599999999999s)]
*  and assume pyramids. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=736.16s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=737.0s)]
*  So now I have to look at every fucking hill and go, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=738.76s)]
*  should we dig this thing up? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=741.7199999999999s)]
*  See, and some of them are just hills. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=743.0s)]
*  Yeah, some are just hills, but some are these, right? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=744.84s)]
*  Got it. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=748.1600000000001s)]
*  So when the Anunnaki came to Earth, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=749.0s)]
*  were there already homo sapiens here? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=750.32s)]
*  Yes, good question. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=751.88s)]
*  There were already not homo sapiens, but hominids. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=753.32s)]
*  No, there weren't homo sapiens. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=756.0400000000001s)]
*  Our cousins. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=756.88s)]
*  Bad question. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=757.72s)]
*  They were homo erectus, they were our cousins. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=758.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they were. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=761.08s)]
*  But I believe that they were more intelligent [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=761.9200000000001s)]
*  than us spiritually. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=763.8000000000001s)]
*  So is it fair to say that the aliens [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=764.84s)]
*  were the first ones to smash monkeys? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=768.44s)]
*  No, they didn't do the monkeys. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=771.0400000000001s)]
*  They had to, right? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=772.8s)]
*  Because we were here. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=775.12s)]
*  They didn't call us apes, they called us beings. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=776.12s)]
*  And in the Epic of Atra-Hasis, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=779.4s)]
*  there was this big war getting ready to happen. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=781.76s)]
*  And Enki and Lil and Anu were in this place [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=784.24s)]
*  in South Africa called Adam's Calendar, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=787.88s)]
*  where they found the very first gold mines [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=789.64s)]
*  that human beings were working underneath their boot. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=791.24s)]
*  Anyway, so the Igigi, who were the working class Anunnaki, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=793.84s)]
*  came from Mars to Earth to go to war against them, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=797.3199999999999s)]
*  because they felt like they were being enslaved, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=800.3199999999999s)]
*  even though they weren't supposed to be. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=801.88s)]
*  They were just working class people. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=803.08s)]
*  They felt like they were doing too much labor. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=804.92s)]
*  For 250,000 years, they were working. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=806.4s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=809.32s)]
*  They came to Earth and circled the campus, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=810.16s)]
*  and they said, we're gonna go to war. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=812.68s)]
*  And it was like, well, why? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=814.4399999999999s)]
*  And they were like, well, we've been asking you for relief. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=816.32s)]
*  The workload is too heavy, and we don't have any women. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=819.28s)]
*  And so- [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=822.36s)]
*  That's a big issue. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=823.56s)]
*  They were complaining about no women, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=824.4s)]
*  literally in ancient tablets. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=825.68s)]
*  And so Enki says- [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=827.72s)]
*  They need a king of diamonds, bro. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=829.48s)]
*  What were they saying? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=831.88s)]
*  What were they saying in the ancient tablets? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=833.52s)]
*  I have an idea. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=834.9200000000001s)]
*  Because they had kind of discussed [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=836.6s)]
*  in a weird way fashioning people. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=837.96s)]
*  That means like robotics. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=840.4s)]
*  But they had talked about their home planet. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=842.72s)]
*  When they tried that, it failed. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=844.88s)]
*  So that's a clue as to what AI and robotics [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=847.32s)]
*  can do to a planet. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=849.6800000000001s)]
*  They were like, there's an existing being here, though, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=851.04s)]
*  that we can add our essence to, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=853.16s)]
*  through genetic modification, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=854.8000000000001s)]
*  and get them to bear your load. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=856.72s)]
*  So don't make robots, make people. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=858.52s)]
*  They can do your work for you. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=860.28s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=861.28s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=862.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=862.96s)]
*  Wow. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=863.8s)]
*  So they started with that method first. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=864.62s)]
*  So they're just forcing human beings [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=865.46s)]
*  to do their work for them. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=867.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=868.1999999999999s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=869.04s)]
*  And that's how you bring them the offerings. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=869.88s)]
*  When you bring the offerings, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=872.92s)]
*  your best harvest and your fresh calves, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=874.24s)]
*  that's their meat, that's their food. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=876.92s)]
*  This is what you see in the biblical text. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=878.48s)]
*  They're eating. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=879.8s)]
*  That's their meals. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=880.88s)]
*  They're not gonna go out and hunt. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=881.72s)]
*  I mean, this archeologist was talking to me in Egypt [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=883.4399999999999s)]
*  in 2014, he was just laughing. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=886.72s)]
*  He was showing me one of the altars. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=889.2s)]
*  He said, these people were so dumb. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=889.92s)]
*  He just said, his own people, his own people. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=891.52s)]
*  He says, they would line up in ancient times from miles [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=894.24s)]
*  to bring their best offerings to the head god. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=897.16s)]
*  And the god was just putting them, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=901.12s)]
*  all this food in the store houses. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=902.84s)]
*  And he showed me where the store houses [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=904.28s)]
*  were inside these temples. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=905.48s)]
*  They would put these things in there. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=906.8000000000001s)]
*  Then they had these other areas underneath the temple [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=907.92s)]
*  where other priests would go underneath and speak, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=910.64s)]
*  and it would resonate their voice, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=913.28s)]
*  and it would be the voice of God talking. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=915.16s)]
*  And it was all this, it wasn't but a sham. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=918.08s)]
*  To get them to bring all this food and gold [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=920.1600000000001s)]
*  and offerings and everything else. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=921.96s)]
*  I mean, I do believe that, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=923.24s)]
*  because if you go to Chichen Itza, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=924.08s)]
*  you can have a, the limestone creates this [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=926.6s)]
*  vibration effect, and you can have a conversation. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=930.96s)]
*  Me and you can talk to one another across a football field. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=933.76s)]
*  Like this. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=936.44s)]
*  The sound bounces. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=937.6s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=938.76s)]
*  Comes right back at you. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=939.6s)]
*  So they were using that as some sort of [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=940.44s)]
*  technological advantage, like some Wizard of Oz shit. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=942.5600000000001s)]
*  So were they literally eating, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=945.76s)]
*  or were they eating off the energy of the sacrifice? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=946.72s)]
*  No, they were eating the food. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=949.4399999999999s)]
*  They were barbecuing. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=950.68s)]
*  What about sacrifice? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=951.52s)]
*  What about, they had a cookout? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=952.36s)]
*  They weren't barbecuing. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=954.0s)]
*  They weren't barbecuing. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=956.0s)]
*  They were just there. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=959.64s)]
*  Eating oxtails. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=961.48s)]
*  Trying for a hot. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=962.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=963.16s)]
*  Someone sacrifice some more hot sauce. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=965.0s)]
*  I mean, think about it. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=966.84s)]
*  I mean, if you were the ruler of a planet. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=969.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=974.28s)]
*  I think you might be putting on what you would do. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=975.12s)]
*  Is that possible? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=976.84s)]
*  That's what I'm telling you. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=978.68s)]
*  These people ate the food because [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=980.28s)]
*  I take tours to Egypt all the time. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=982.08s)]
*  Last year I took 140 people. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=983.4s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=985.68s)]
*  On a private tour. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=986.52s)]
*  And when I go, I take a homegrown Egyptologist [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=987.36s)]
*  and a homegrown guide with us. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=990.2s)]
*  And he takes us to the temples where they actually have the, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=992.04s)]
*  hold on, where they actually have the store houses. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=995.28s)]
*  You're getting hungry. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=999.0s)]
*  These guys are hungry. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1001.96s)]
*  They're not going to have barbecues. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1005.16s)]
*  Hey man. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1008.16s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1009.0s)]
*  Okay, so go, see you there. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1009.84s)]
*  They take you to all the different spots. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1011.88s)]
*  Yeah, so we take you to the temples [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1013.0s)]
*  and we show you where they would hide the food. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1014.6s)]
*  Where they take all the offerings [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1016.2s)]
*  and where they would store it. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1017.36s)]
*  It was their grocery store, literally. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1018.84s)]
*  Wow. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1020.48s)]
*  Tour announcement. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1021.32s)]
*  We're two weekends away. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1023.16s)]
*  Master Square Garden, May 3rd and 4th. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1024.4s)]
*  I'll see you all there. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1027.52s)]
*  I cannot wait. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1028.84s)]
*  Peace. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1029.92s)]
*  Is Jesus part alien? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1030.76s)]
*  I believe so. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1032.12s)]
*  And was he part alien and trying to do good? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1032.96s)]
*  Yes, I believe so. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1036.6000000000001s)]
*  So he was breaking away, he was using his power [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1037.44s)]
*  and he was like, yo, what these aliens are doing to us [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1039.76s)]
*  is fucked up. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1041.48s)]
*  We need to break free from that [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1042.6000000000001s)]
*  and I'm going to liberate the people. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1044.08s)]
*  Yeah, so you have to understand, you're right on point. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1045.32s)]
*  There's good and evil in everything. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1048.1200000000001s)]
*  Jesus is the man, bro. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1048.96s)]
*  Yeah, he's fine. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1050.28s)]
*  There's good and evil in everything. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1051.1200000000001s)]
*  We're all part alien at this point, right? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1051.96s)]
*  Absolutely, everything's in our DNA. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1053.4s)]
*  Ah, fuck, I thought he was a little bit more. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1054.8400000000001s)]
*  Well, he was more. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1056.52s)]
*  He was a little bit more, yes. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1057.3600000000001s)]
*  How is he a little bit more? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1058.2s)]
*  Well, if you look at the Apocrypha text, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1059.02s)]
*  you discover that not only was Jesus' mom a virgin birth, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1061.48s)]
*  but his grandmother was also a virgin birth. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1065.8400000000001s)]
*  Nobody ever talks about that in church [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1068.76s)]
*  and you hear about that in Sunday school. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1070.44s)]
*  Wait a minute, so his grandma, so, wow. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1071.76s)]
*  So you see this establishment of this particular bloodline [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1074.8400000000001s)]
*  and then all of a sudden he comes through the womb [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1078.4s)]
*  and then begins to regain all of his own memories, right? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1080.88s)]
*  So he is a reincarnation of himself [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1084.1200000000001s)]
*  from a previous lifetime. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1086.2s)]
*  That's why sometimes I hypothesize [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1088.0800000000002s)]
*  that he could be Thoth the Atlantean [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1089.84s)]
*  who says that he could incarnate on and in [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1091.52s)]
*  any plane he desires. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1094.76s)]
*  Could he have decided now to come back through the womb? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1096.8s)]
*  So Thoth the Atlantean was the king of the Atlantean Empire. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1099.0s)]
*  Yeah, he was one of them. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1102.72s)]
*  Or one of the leaders of the Atlantean Empire. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1104.3999999999999s)]
*  He is reincarnating inside Jesus. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1105.8799999999999s)]
*  And why has he chosen to help the people [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1108.1599999999999s)]
*  instead of enslave us like he did in the past? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1110.8999999999999s)]
*  Good question. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1112.9199999999998s)]
*  When you look at the ancient text [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1113.76s)]
*  where Jesus gets all of his information from, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1115.06s)]
*  the Emerald Tablets of Thoth. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1118.26s)]
*  We need to talk about that on tablets, bro. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1120.48s)]
*  36, 38,000 year old text. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1121.6000000000001s)]
*  In there, in the book that I wrote about it, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1124.0400000000002s)]
*  I line up the Christian text [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1126.0s)]
*  and I line up Jesus' text from the New Testament. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1128.1200000000001s)]
*  This is gonna seem really ignorant. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1132.5200000000002s)]
*  People were writing shit down 36,000 years ago? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1133.68s)]
*  Thoth authored these tablets himself. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1136.44s)]
*  He actually wrote, he didn't have a scribe. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1138.5600000000002s)]
*  A lot of the times these God figures [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1140.6000000000001s)]
*  or these leaders would have scribes. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1142.0s)]
*  He actually wrote it down himself. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1143.8400000000001s)]
*  He actually put it onto these tablets. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1145.44s)]
*  And what is he writing in? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1148.0800000000002s)]
*  What language? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1150.16s)]
*  Well, it looked like the language was runes, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1151.0s)]
*  R-U-N-E-S, okay? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1152.0800000000002s)]
*  And in this text, he writes about coming to this planet [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1154.1200000000001s)]
*  after the great flood [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1159.3600000000001s)]
*  and seeing the temples of ancient chemists [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1161.16s)]
*  sticking up out of the mud [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1163.6000000000001s)]
*  and actually going on a mission [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1165.5600000000002s)]
*  to help rebuild civilization. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1167.68s)]
*  Not that it was for the first time, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1170.3400000000001s)]
*  but he's rebuilding it to a high level. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1172.24s)]
*  So it was already built, destroyed. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1174.52s)]
*  He's like, hey, let's run it back again. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1176.68s)]
*  His father sends him on a mission. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1178.92s)]
*  His father says, go to the land of chem [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1180.0800000000002s)]
*  and do the plan that ye know of. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1183.3200000000002s)]
*  So he gets his crew [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1185.24s)]
*  and he gets into the great ship of the master [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1186.88s)]
*  and he takes off until the planet disappears. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1188.72s)]
*  This is ancient text. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1191.76s)]
*  Which is the horizon. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1192.6000000000001s)]
*  Right, he's up in the sky. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1193.42s)]
*  Oh, he's coming from? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1194.3200000000002s)]
*  He's in a ship that goes up. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1195.44s)]
*  Gotcha. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1196.52s)]
*  Because you know this, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1197.3600000000001s)]
*  because when he gets over the land of chem, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1198.18s)]
*  he goes, I see the land of chem beneath us [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1199.2800000000002s)]
*  and I see the temples rising up out of the mud [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1201.88s)]
*  that were flooded by the fountains. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1204.3600000000001s)]
*  Now we come back. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1205.88s)]
*  Now he comes down to the ground. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1206.72s)]
*  The fountains is the great flood. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1208.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1209.6s)]
*  Got it, okay. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1210.4399999999998s)]
*  He opens the door, he comes out [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1211.26s)]
*  and he calls these people barbarians coming to attack him. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1212.28s)]
*  Probably he's territorial. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1214.96s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1216.1599999999999s)]
*  And he says, I raised my staff [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1217.0s)]
*  and sent out a ray of vibration, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1218.72s)]
*  stopping them still as fragments of stone of the mountain. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1220.56s)]
*  So now he's got a stun gun [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1223.32s)]
*  that can freeze them in their tracks. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1224.4399999999998s)]
*  That's fire. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1226.04s)]
*  That's technology. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1226.8799999999999s)]
*  That is. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1227.72s)]
*  Right? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1228.56s)]
*  Now we have something. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1229.3799999999999s)]
*  So is the spaceship. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1231.22s)]
*  Right, right, right, right. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1232.36s)]
*  But we have something right now in the military [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1234.04s)]
*  called the active denial system. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1235.52s)]
*  Which is? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1236.96s)]
*  When gays try to join? [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1238.48s)]
*  No, no. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1239.32s)]
*  Gee. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1240.1599999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1240.98s)]
*  I like to strike that from the record, your honor. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1241.82s)]
*  Gee. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1244.8s)]
*  No, it's a system that works just like [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1245.6399999999999s)]
*  what he described in ancient tablets [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1249.68s)]
*  where it sends out a beam, a ray. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1251.08s)]
*  Type in active denial system, put it up there. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1252.84s)]
*  It sends out a beam at a crowd of people coming to attack. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1255.48s)]
*  Right? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1259.1599999999999s)]
*  To riot or whatever. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1260.0s)]
*  And it stops them in their tracks. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1261.2s)]
*  It makes them feel like they're in pain. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1262.3999999999999s)]
*  Makes them feel like they wanna vomit. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1263.76s)]
*  Put voices in their head. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1264.9199999999998s)]
*  Wow. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1266.1599999999999s)]
*  And whatever you wanna do, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1267.0s)]
*  you can program the frequency into their body [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1267.84s)]
*  to make it do that. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1269.6s)]
*  Is this what the people said they were experiencing [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1270.52s)]
*  in the- [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1272.36s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1274.02s)]
*  At the base in- [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1274.86s)]
*  Yeah, Havana syndrome. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1275.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1276.52s)]
*  Okay, okay, okay. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1277.36s)]
*  Keep going, keep going. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1278.2s)]
*  So then here's the key about the God thing. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1279.02s)]
*  Him not wanting to be one of these gods. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1281.08s)]
*  When he released them from that, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1284.4s)]
*  he started talking to the people peacefully [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1286.88s)]
*  and they started groveling at his feet. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1289.12s)]
*  And he said, no, no, no. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1290.76s)]
*  Get up. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1292.44s)]
*  He said, I'm a son of Atlantis. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1293.44s)]
*  He didn't say I'm God. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1295.3999999999999s)]
*  He said, I'm a son of Atlantis [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1297.08s)]
*  and I'm here to bring you back up [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1298.4799999999998s)]
*  to a high level of civilization. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1300.6s)]
*  And he worked with the people for a couple thousand years [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1302.1599999999999s)]
*  to rebuild that civilization. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1304.76s)]
*  Before he left and told us, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1306.7199999999998s)]
*  he told all of his people that came here with him, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1308.12s)]
*  spread out around the planet. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1309.9799999999998s)]
*  This is how Atlantis advanced again. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1311.28s)]
*  Spread out around the planet [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1313.0s)]
*  and duplicate what we did here. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1314.1599999999999s)]

*  Well, the Bible is about reincarnation, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1498.04s)]

*  that it's not about reincarnation. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1501.8s)]
*  But when you even look into the book of revelations, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1504.04s)]
*  it says you're gonna get a new name and a new body. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1505.96s)]
*  It didn't say he was gonna be a spirit with energy. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1509.0s)]

*  a physical body. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1513.28s)]
*  And that you're gonna live inside of that body. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1515.04s)]
*  And so you're gonna come back and be born again. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1517.48s)]
*  You know? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1522.04s)]

*  And there's an African student there who's like, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1611.84s)]
*  Christianity was in Africa before it was in Europe. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1614.6399999999999s)]
*  And one of the white girls are just like, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1617.12s)]
*  ah, no, we'll just set it. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1618.2s)]
*  So this does, I imagine, speak to that, right? [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1619.84s)]
*  So who was it that went to Ethiopia? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1621.6399999999999s)]
*  Which tribe ended up going there? [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1626.04s)]
*  Because I think it was, there's a Jewish. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1628.2s)]
*  Oh, you're talking about the- [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1631.08s)]
*  Isaac, was it, that he went down there? [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1631.9199999999998s)]
*  One of the 12. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1634.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, one of the 12 tribes, Moses went down there. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1636.04s)]
*  No, I think it was a different- [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1638.28s)]
*  But Moses went down there and met his wife, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1639.12s)]
*  and she was a woman of Kush. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1641.12s)]
*  So the Kushite people ended up in Ethiopia. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1643.08s)]
*  Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1645.96s)]
*  I thought there was one of his, I thought it was some, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1647.32s)]
*  one of the 12 went there, but I could be wrong. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1650.6399999999999s)]
*  Maybe it's Matthew? Matthew? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1655.6399999999999s)]
*  It's possible, but- [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1657.24s)]
*  So he called Mermena, supposedly an Ethiopian, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1658.08s)]
*  describing as a land that was inhabited [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1662.0s)]
*  by tribes of cannibals, oh. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1663.9199999999998s)]
*  After departing from Jerusalem [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1666.8799999999999s)]
*  and the Holy Apostle Matthew preached [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1668.1999999999998s)]
*  the glad tidings of the gospel, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1670.36s)]
*  and that's why you see a Jewish faction there as well. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1672.28s)]
*  Okay, so the earliest version of the Bible, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1675.1599999999999s)]
*  or one of the earliest, is in Ethiopia. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1678.0s)]
*  What are the differences between that Bible [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1679.8799999999999s)]
*  and let's say like the King James? [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1681.84s)]
*  Okay, and a couple things. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1683.6s)]
*  The first, the Old Testament is the Torah [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1684.52s)]
*  from the Ethiopian Torah. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1688.36s)]
*  Wait, the oldest Torah we have is also Ethiopian? [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1691.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1694.76s)]
*  Dude, black people hold it. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1695.8s)]
*  That's what I'm telling you, bro. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1697.32s)]
*  They still stick here. Really? [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1698.6s)]
*  Oh, we're the original Jews. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1699.68s)]
*  I'm trying to tell you. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1701.0s)]
*  I gotta go to Brooklyn and apologize. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1701.8400000000001s)]
*  People are like, it was right the whole time. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1703.48s)]
*  Yeah, come on, man. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1705.4s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1706.24s)]
*  Our year of being was right the whole time. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1707.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1707.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1708.76s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1709.6000000000001s)]
*  It was, actually. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1710.44s)]
*  I did a whole documentary, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1712.0800000000002s)]
*  a whole mini documentary on this. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1712.96s)]
*  Really? [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1714.56s)]
*  Full research. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1715.4s)]
*  Okay, I wanna get into all of that, but take us there. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1716.24s)]
*  Okay, so oldest version of Old Testament, Ethiopia. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1718.44s)]
*  Ethiopia. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1721.64s)]
*  Oldest version of New Testament, either Sinai or Ethiopia. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1722.48s)]
*  What are the differences we see in these, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1726.28s)]
*  and then the newer versions of the text? [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1728.28s)]
*  Well, what's interesting is the text, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1730.52s)]
*  there's less mistranslations. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1733.36s)]
*  Less mistranslations, got it. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1736.52s)]
*  In the Ethiopian Bible and the Sinai Bible, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1738.08s)]
*  there's about 12 to 14,000 differences [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1740.6s)]
*  than the more modernized King James Version. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1744.52s)]
*  And what are the differences? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1747.56s)]
*  Well, for example, Moses never crossed the Red Sea. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1749.36s)]
*  He crossed the Sea of Reeds, which is a closer, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1754.1200000000001s)]
*  much smaller and easier sea to cross. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1757.12s)]
*  As a matter of fact, if you talk to geologists, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1759.6799999999998s)]
*  which like I did, you'll find if you do a geological rewind [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1761.72s)]
*  to go back in time with tectonic plate movements, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1765.36s)]
*  a computer model will simulate [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1768.56s)]
*  that there was an actual tsunami in that area [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1770.12s)]
*  somewhere within that timeframe, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1772.96s)]
*  give or take 100 years or so, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1774.28s)]
*  which would have easily wiped out that area, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1776.0s)]
*  completely dried out the Sea of Reeds, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1778.0s)]
*  and you can walk right across. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1779.9199999999998s)]
*  Then the water would have come crashing back. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1781.52s)]
*  Wow. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1783.3999999999999s)]
*  But he never crossed the Red Sea. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1784.6399999999999s)]
*  Also another mistranslation is the God. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1786.52s)]
*  God is not supposed to be singular in the Bible. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1790.6399999999999s)]
*  It's plural in all cases, gods with an S. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1793.8799999999999s)]
*  Oh, ah, gosh, really can't see. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1797.12s)]
*  We gotta keep this one. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1798.6399999999999s)]
*  We gotta keep this one. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1800.28s)]
*  Believe that, believe that, believe that. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1801.92s)]
*  We have multiple gods and reincarnations. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1804.32s)]
*  By the odd of some. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1807.24s)]
*  So hold on. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1809.24s)]
*  But you see that in certain languages, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1810.84s)]
*  like God in Spanish is Dios, not Dio. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1812.12s)]
*  So that would be gods. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1815.84s)]
*  There is a plurality too. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1817.84s)]
*  You know why? [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1819.08s)]
*  Because that is Father, Son, Holy Ghost maybe? [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1819.9199999999998s)]
*  No, they just copied it from the ancient texts and tablets. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1821.48s)]
*  Biting, biting. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1824.1999999999998s)]
*  In the ancient texts and tablets, it's multiple gods. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1825.24s)]
*  In the Bible, you have the gods are Enlil, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1828.12s)]
*  and which is who's also known as Yahweh in the Bible. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1831.6399999999999s)]
*  And you also have Amun-Ra, the great Amen. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1835.4399999999998s)]
*  When you say the Lord's Prayer, that's Enki's Prayer. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1839.32s)]
*  Our Father who art in heaven, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1842.24s)]
*  Hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1843.36s)]
*  and we'll be done on earth as it is in heaven. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1844.84s)]
*  Give us the daily bread, blah, blah, blah. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1846.12s)]
*  That's Ptah's Prayer, who's also known as Enki. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1847.84s)]
*  In which religion? [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1850.96s)]
*  In Christianity. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1852.08s)]
*  Enki is in Christianity. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1853.3999999999999s)]
*  No, no, he's ancient Sumerian. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1854.48s)]
*  Okay, that's Sumerian. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1856.32s)]
*  He's in Anunnaki, so you're praying to him. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1858.68s)]
*  Okay, I don't wanna go away. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1860.84s)]
*  I wanna learn about the Sumerians, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1864.08s)]
*  because I think that's really important [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1865.3999999999999s)]
*  to everything else you talk about. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1866.32s)]
*  But I just wanna learn some more [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1867.72s)]
*  about these differences in the Bible. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1869.52s)]
*  This is always really fun. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1871.1599999999999s)]
*  Obviously with translation, you're gonna find [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1872.68s)]
*  differences, where people are explaining [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1875.68s)]
*  the meaning of certain things. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1876.6s)]
*  I'll give you one big translation that's off. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1877.44s)]
*  They say, well, Jesus was crucified. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1880.48s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1884.12s)]
*  Well, that doesn't exist in the Sinai Bible. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1885.2s)]
*  What happened to that? [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1888.28s)]
*  It doesn't exist in the Book of Barnabas. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1889.12s)]
*  It's a fire named Barnabas. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1893.8s)]
*  I know, but they left that out of the Bible on purpose, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1895.08s)]
*  by accident. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1898.28s)]
*  So how did they kill him? [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1899.12s)]
*  They didn't kill him. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1901.4s)]
*  In Harvard Library, there is a book of Jesus's wife [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1903.24s)]
*  at the Harvard Seminary School. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1906.4399999999998s)]
*  And they found that about eight years ago. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1909.08s)]
*  Jesus's wife is the Mary Magdalene? [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1910.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1913.36s)]
*  So she was not actually- [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1914.24s)]
*  They're assuming it's Mary Magdalene. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1915.48s)]
*  It doesn't specifically say, but we'll assume that it is. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1916.52s)]
*  Which means he probably had kids, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1919.1599999999999s)]
*  and his Mary Benjian bloodline [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1920.3999999999999s)]
*  is still probably walking the land till this very day. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1922.32s)]
*  Wow. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1924.6399999999999s)]
*  That's in, what was that great book, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1926.28s)]
*  the Dan Brown book, the Da Vinci Code. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1928.6s)]
*  Da Vinci Code, yeah. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1930.3999999999999s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes, yes. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1931.24s)]
*  So there's probably someone related to Jesus right now. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1932.6399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1935.72s)]
*  Kanye. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1936.56s)]
*  Stop it. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1937.3999999999999s)]
*  Stop it. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1939.24s)]
*  Stop it. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1940.08s)]
*  It might be Ryan Garcia. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1940.9199999999998s)]
*  The miracle workers, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1943.76s)]
*  it's always the miracle workers, isn't it? [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1944.8s)]
*  So it's interesting that that's a mistranslated. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1947.24s)]
*  Another one actually, interestingly enough- [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1949.24s)]
*  Just give us more, this is fun. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1950.56s)]
*  The word for virgin was mistranslated from Aramaic [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1951.96s)]
*  into Greek. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1956.3999999999999s)]
*  So the word originally meant, I think it was laga, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1958.96s)]
*  which means young woman. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1962.6s)]
*  By the time it got to Greek, [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1963.56s)]
*  it was translated wrongly into virgin, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1965.4399999999998s)]
*  which then made it into the biggest part of the story [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1968.4399999999998s)]
*  of Jesus, which is that his mother was a virgin. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1971.1999999999998s)]
*  So she might not have been a virgin. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1973.24s)]
*  It's possible, but when I saw the, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1974.8s)]
*  what convinced me, that's why I look deeper. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1976.56s)]
*  That's how I found out about the grandmother. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1978.28s)]
*  I said it might be true, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1979.9599999999998s)]
*  but they still use that mistranslated word for that. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1981.6799999999998s)]
*  Maybe they didn't have another word to use, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1984.1599999999999s)]
*  but that's a big mistake, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1986.36s)]
*  because there's certain parts of the Bible [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1988.8799999999999s)]
*  where they use that same word [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1991.92s)]
*  to describe women as being virgins, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1992.96s)]
*  and they tell men that you have the right to wreck them. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1995.8000000000002s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1998.3200000000002s)]
*  That's in the book of Deuteronomy. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=1999.16s)]
*  Who wrote that one? [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2001.24s)]
*  God said this in the book of Deuteronomy. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2002.52s)]
*  He says- [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2004.68s)]
*  Is this Old Testament Deuteronomy? [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2005.8400000000001s)]
*  It's Old Testament, yeah. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2007.0400000000002s)]
*  Wow. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2008.0800000000002s)]
*  Towards the end of the Old Testament, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2008.92s)]
*  he says, if you see a woman walking through a field, [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2009.76s)]
*  and you want her, you can wreck her. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2013.2s)]
*  Exact words used, by the way. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2015.44s)]
*  And it says, if after you wreck her, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2017.3600000000001s)]
*  you decide you want to keep her, [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2019.72s)]
*  you can make her your wife. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2021.08s)]
*  Wow. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2023.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's God. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2024.72s)]
*  That's the, see, here we go. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2026.16s)]
*  The creator of the universe, of the multiverse, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2028.24s)]
*  that can think planets into existence, [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2031.56s)]
*  that can speak things into reality. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2033.88s)]
*  Is R. Kelly. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2037.2s)]
*  It's gonna, yeah, exactly. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2038.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2039.68s)]
*  It's gonna say, you know what? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2040.6000000000001s)]
*  I believe in God. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2042.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2043.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2044.8s)]
*  I love you guys. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2045.64s)]
*  He did that great lyric, man. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2046.48s)]
*  Yeah, that was a bomb. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2048.6000000000004s)]
*  That was a bomb. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2049.8s)]
*  Wow. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2051.2400000000002s)]
*  Oh, this is great. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2052.2400000000002s)]
*  So Deuteronomy is really, is a wild book, huh? [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2053.0800000000004s)]
*  Deuteronomy is so bad, and this is where, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2056.0s)]
*  you know, you go, wait a minute, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2058.88s)]
*  this is really not the creator of the universe. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2060.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2062.36s)]
*  God says, there's a person in a town, far away, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2063.2000000000003s)]
*  who speaks ill of me. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2067.56s)]
*  Go there, and get over the town walls, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2069.6000000000004s)]
*  kill the women, kill the children, kill infants, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2073.1600000000003s)]
*  and bring the spoils of war back to me. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2077.48s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2079.72s)]
*  Now what kind of God needs spoils of war? [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2080.64s)]
*  You're God, you got everything. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2082.84s)]
*  Yeah, just look up Evil Bible. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2084.16s)]
*  Google Evil Bible, and go to the book of Deuteronomy. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2085.96s)]
*  So who do you think wrote this? [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2089.16s)]
*  These are these Anunnaki people. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2091.48s)]
*  See, they were, these Atlantean leaders, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2092.6s)]
*  it got to the point where they became greedy, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2095.12s)]
*  and they became self-made gods, and they really believed it. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2097.28s)]
*  They were battling each other over resources. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2101.88s)]
*  Like the pharaohs of Egypt, in a way. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2103.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2105.36s)]
*  Gotcha, you're trying to call power. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2106.2s)]
*  And they were fighting over resources and people. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2107.64s)]
*  Wow. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2108.68s)]
*  Battling and, you know, literally like fighting over [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2109.52s)]
*  who's controlling who. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2111.36s)]
*  And how we all got to be different races, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2113.2s)]
*  that goes back to... [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2115.68s)]
*  How did that happen? [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2117.84s)]
*  Yeah, that goes back to the Tower of Babel incident, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2118.68s)]
*  and the Bible, which comes out of the Sumerian tablets. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2121.4s)]
*  Okay, explain what Ancient Sumeria is real quick, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2123.56s)]
*  because we keep referencing it, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2126.2s)]
*  and I also want to understand. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2127.32s)]
*  Well, Ancient Sumeria is a location, [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2129.2799999999997s)]
*  right now, would be Iraq. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2133.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2134.36s)]
*  And Iraq, which at that time was extended part [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2135.44s)]
*  of what Africa actually is, believe it or not. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2138.6000000000004s)]
*  But it was a multicultural location. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2140.92s)]
*  Got it. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2143.6800000000003s)]
*  The people there were advanced beyond belief. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2144.52s)]
*  They had achieved a high level of advanced construction, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2148.32s)]
*  waterways, irrigation, mathematics, you name it. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2152.0s)]
*  Is this Tigris and Euphrates? [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2155.1600000000003s)]
*  Between the Tigris and the Euphrates, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2156.88s)]
*  where the Garden of Eden is located. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2158.2000000000003s)]
*  Got it, okay. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2159.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2160.8s)]
*  And this makes sense, because I imagine like [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2161.6400000000003s)]
*  the Tigris and Euphrates would overflow, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2162.6800000000003s)]
*  and there would be this great fresh water [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2165.36s)]
*  that would spill onto the land, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2166.76s)]
*  and then they would have tons of fruits and vegetables, [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2168.1200000000003s)]
*  and they would grow quite seamlessly. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2170.08s)]
*  In a similar way to like the Nile, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2171.1600000000003s)]
*  people spoke of what happened to like [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2172.88s)]

*  Right, very fruitful. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2176.76s)]
*  Okay, so you have lots of food. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2177.6000000000004s)]
*  When humans have lots of food, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2179.44s)]
*  and an ability potentially to protect themselves, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2181.28s)]
*  society can grow. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2184.52s)]
*  So this is the idea. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2185.76s)]
*  Okay, so Sumeria, now this is a culture [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2187.6400000000003s)]
*  that is influenced by the Atlanteans, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2190.44s)]
*  or this is just humans. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2192.6800000000003s)]
*  Family influenced by Atlanteans. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2194.0s)]
*  Okay, so the Atlanteans are ruling it, or? [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2195.36s)]
*  They built a base there, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2198.68s)]
*  and Enlil is the one who built the base, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2200.56s)]
*  Yahweh from the biblical text. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2202.28s)]
*  He built a base there, and he said, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2203.64s)]
*  I'm going to create a design for cities [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2205.64s)]
*  that will last for all time on this planet. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2208.44s)]
*  And is this the first city that is erected? [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2211.28s)]
*  One of the most advanced cities. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2213.72s)]
*  It's got street grids, it has a town center, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2215.44s)]
*  it has plumbing, all of that exists at this time. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2219.96s)]
*  And this is how long ago? [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2223.28s)]
*  This is about roughly 8,000 years ago, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2224.52s)]
*  according to mainstream. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2226.6000000000004s)]
*  But if you go to the real, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2228.36s)]
*  understand that these tablets are copied tablets [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2229.6800000000003s)]
*  from even more ancient tablets, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2231.5600000000004s)]
*  we could be talking 40, 50, 100, 200,000 years ago. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2232.6800000000003s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2235.88s)]
*  Even deeper than that. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2236.7200000000003s)]
*  And some geologists have gone to look [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2238.2400000000002s)]
*  at the weather patterns of the destruction [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2241.32s)]
*  of some of these areas, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2243.32s)]
*  and realize that we're talking maybe [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2244.76s)]
*  even almost two ice ages ago. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2247.0800000000004s)]
*  So this is really old stuff. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2249.9s)]
*  So these people were extremely intelligent, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2253.16s)]
*  but they were influenced by these Anunnaki Atlantean people [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2255.0s)]
*  who gave them the knowledge and taught them how to build [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2258.4399999999996s)]
*  and taught them how to do all of this. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2260.52s)]
*  And at the Tower of Babel, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2262.04s)]
*  Yahweh, who was known as Enlil, [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2265.14s)]
*  he helps them to erect this, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2266.7999999999997s)]
*  well, he's built his own tower first, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2268.8799999999997s)]
*  called the Duron Key, which means bond heaven earth. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2270.48s)]
*  And then the humans, when he leaves the ghost of man, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2274.52s)]
*  the humans build a similar structure. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2277.2799999999997s)]
*  When he comes back, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2279.8799999999997s)]
*  I guess it's probably months or years later, [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2280.92s)]
*  he sees that this thing is being built by humans, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2283.0s)]
*  mimicking what their advanced culture had built. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2285.52s)]
*  And he says, oh man, whatever their hearts desire, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2289.12s)]
*  they will achieve it, which that made it into the Bible. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2291.7400000000002s)]
*  And so he destroys the tower, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2295.36s)]
*  just like it says in the Bible. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2297.12s)]
*  And then he says, my seed shall not abide in man forever, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2298.5s)]
*  his year shall be 120. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2303.4s)]
*  That also made it into the biblical texts. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2305.12s)]
*  So you see where it's getting copied from. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2307.94s)]
*  And then in the older ancient texts, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2309.6s)]
*  the Bible was written from 100 AD to 900 AD. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2310.6s)]
*  This text is thousands of years prior. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2313.56s)]
*  And so he then decides to confuse the languages [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2316.2s)]
*  and move people around to different regions of the planet [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2321.0s)]
*  so that we couldn't collaborate. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2323.96s)]
*  Because if we can't collaborate, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2325.6s)]
*  we can do all the things that they can do [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2326.62s)]
*  that we can challenge their power. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2328.04s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2329.84s)]
*  This is where the genetic modification came in. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2330.7999999999997s)]
*  That 120 statement is powerful [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2332.66s)]
*  because at Harvard University, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2334.56s)]
*  they just discovered that the lifespan of a human being [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2336.48s)]
*  maxes out at about 120 years. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2340.2000000000003s)]
*  And that's under the most pristine conditions, no poison. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2342.88s)]
*  That's organ failure and these other things. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2345.54s)]
*  Not counting cancer, outside sources. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2347.7000000000003s)]
*  But how long can your organs really live for? [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2350.2200000000003s)]
*  So that's where the genetic, now the scientists said, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2352.1s)]
*  look, chromosome number two, something happened to humans. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2354.04s)]
*  It was taken out and fused together. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2357.78s)]
*  Instead of having 48, we got 46. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2360.86s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2363.02s)]
*  Fused together, two telomere caps put on the end, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2364.28s)]
*  limiting our lifespan. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2366.42s)]
*  So we know that there was a genetic mutation [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2368.36s)]
*  around the same time, they're saying 200,000 years ago, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2371.48s)]
*  the same times the tablets are roughly estimated [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2374.2000000000003s)]
*  to be written originally about this Tower of Babel incident. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2376.84s)]
*  So it's like ancient text and modern science [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2380.48s)]
*  is almost collaborating with each other. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2383.36s)]
*  And you're saying, man, wait a minute. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2386.48s)]
*  So the geneticists said, it's an artificial mutation. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2388.04s)]
*  But they said, well, who did it? [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2391.76s)]
*  They said, we don't know how it's done. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2392.86s)]
*  They said through natural evolution, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2394.56s)]
*  it would have taken millions and millions of years [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2396.24s)]
*  to happen. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2398.6s)]
*  But it was expedited. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2400.12s)]
*  Re-expedited. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2401.12s)]
*  It was like an anarchy did it. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2401.9599999999996s)]
*  How do we guess that they did? [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2403.12s)]
*  How do we get the races now? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2404.16s)]
*  Me and you aren't dark because our cousins [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2406.3599999999997s)]
*  were working in the sun. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2408.8399999999997s)]
*  Don't believe that, it's foolishness. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2410.7599999999998s)]
*  You're not light skinned because your uncles and aunts [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2413.16s)]
*  were working on top of a mountain in Russia. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2415.4199999999996s)]
*  No. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2418.3199999999997s)]
*  What they discovered was between races, [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2419.3599999999997s)]
*  there's a 2% variance in DNA and genes. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2422.4799999999996s)]
*  2% would take multi-millions of years [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2426.3199999999997s)]
*  through natural evolution. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2429.2799999999997s)]
*  Didn't take that long, only took 200,000 years. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2431.04s)]
*  So what's going on here? [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2432.8399999999997s)]
*  Oh, I understand what you're saying. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2434.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2435.4399999999996s)]
*  Yeah, because. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2436.2799999999997s)]
*  We're branded. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2437.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2437.9399999999996s)]
*  Well, that's kind of interesting [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2439.04s)]
*  because if humans didn't leave the African continent [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2441.68s)]
*  until how many, 100,000s of years ago, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2444.7599999999998s)]
*  you're saying that we left prior [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2447.6s)]
*  to the amount of time necessary [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2449.4399999999996s)]
*  in order for us to naturally evolve [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2451.4399999999996s)]
*  to have these different colors. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2453.3999999999996s)]
*  Correct. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2454.72s)]
*  Big sizes or whatever. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2455.72s)]
*  So, yeah, why did your guy's god love big dick so much? [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2456.64s)]
*  What is that about? [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2462.32s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2463.16s)]
*  When you go to Egypt, in the museum, [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2464.0s)]
*  you see a lot of statues with big penises on them. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2465.7999999999997s)]
*  What is that? [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2467.7599999999998s)]
*  You notice how we didn't look into that, huh? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2468.6s)]
*  Just here, right? [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2469.92s)]
*  We didn't look into that. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2470.7599999999998s)]
*  Mr. Carson heard that, he's like, [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2471.6s)]
*  yeah, we're gonna check that one out. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2472.44s)]
*  We don't check that, yeah. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2473.92s)]
*  But yeah, can you explain that? [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2475.24s)]
*  No daddy, no daddy. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2476.68s)]
*  Because my god. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2478.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2478.84s)]
*  You know, you see Statue of David [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2479.68s)]
*  and he got a little strippy on that side. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2481.4s)]
*  Yeah, for real. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2483.12s)]
*  Okay, so, and then Asians, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2484.0s)]
*  where the fuck do they come from? [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2486.56s)]
*  That's just crazy. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2487.84s)]
*  Because they're the most different. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2489.68s)]
*  Yeah, they're really different. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2490.88s)]
*  But here's what- [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2492.28s)]
*  They are! [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2493.12s)]
*  I'm saying that because my wife is Asian. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2493.96s)]
*  Yeah, so tell me, what's the deal? [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2495.48s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2497.6s)]
*  So, when you look at the Anunnaki [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2498.56s)]
*  and you discover that they were multiracial people, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2501.12s)]
*  they all look different. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2504.4s)]
*  The crew that Thoth took to chem with him, [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2505.4s)]
*  they were all different looking people. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2508.8s)]
*  Even one person had married a woman from another planet. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2511.2400000000002s)]
*  According to these texts, not according to me. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2514.6400000000003s)]
*  When he said, go around the planet [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2515.6800000000003s)]
*  and duplicate what we did here. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2517.52s)]
*  So now, you and I, we're already in Africa, right? [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2519.52s)]
*  You go to Europe, you go over to Mesoamerica, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2522.6000000000004s)]
*  and you are ruling over people. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2526.6400000000003s)]
*  Now, what does a farmer do right now if they have cows? [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2529.96s)]
*  They brand the cow. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2533.36s)]
*  So in case my cow wanders off, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2534.6400000000003s)]
*  you know, oh, that's farmer Jim's cow. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2536.2000000000003s)]
*  We gotta get it back to him. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2538.1600000000003s)]
*  So everybody made their people look like them [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2539.28s)]
*  so they knew these are our property. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2541.8s)]
*  So they're like, oh, we're gonna make a man [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2544.48s)]
*  and our image. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2546.24s)]
*  I believe, my hypothesis is that we are genetically [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2547.08s)]
*  branded people for the people that we were ruled over by. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2550.68s)]
*  So what color do we all start as? [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2554.8399999999997s)]
*  No one knows. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2557.0s)]
*  When you talk about these Anunnaki texts, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2558.68s)]
*  it describes them. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2562.08s)]
*  There's only one reference in the Sumerian Tabitha [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2563.56s)]
*  that references the people that took the brunt of a bomb [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2566.04s)]
*  that got dropped in ancient times. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2569.56s)]
*  And they call them the black-faced people. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2571.48s)]
*  And the wind took them over and their hair fell out [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2574.2000000000003s)]
*  and their nails fell off and their eyes were bleeding. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2575.52s)]
*  It's like radiation sickness. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2577.8s)]
*  That's the only reference we actually have [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2580.28s)]
*  of the way anybody really looks, other than the hair. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2582.36s)]
*  They talk about hair in the Epic of Gilgamesh. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2585.52s)]
*  They talk about locks. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2588.04s)]
*  But does that mean locks like you just have long hair [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2589.8s)]
*  or does it mean dreadlocks? [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2591.92s)]
*  We don't really know. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2593.1200000000003s)]
*  But it's interesting. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2594.32s)]
*  Well, some white people get dreadlocks too. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2595.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, true. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2596.48s)]
*  So it's interesting. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2597.32s)]
*  So you don't know. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2598.1600000000003s)]
*  We don't really, true. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2600.0s)]
*  Anybody who's making hard, hard factual statements [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2601.32s)]
*  like that, they're just making it up. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2604.04s)]
*  So what about Blake Griffin, who branded him? [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2606.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2607.84s)]
*  Yeah, which one? [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2608.6800000000003s)]
*  What did we do when we started mixing and matching? [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2609.52s)]
*  Like, what's going on there? [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2611.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2612.36s)]
*  Was that bad or is that good? [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2613.4s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2614.7200000000003s)]
*  Well. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2615.56s)]
*  What is it? [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2616.36s)]
*  It can't be. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2617.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, what would the gods say about that? [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2618.6400000000003s)]
*  In the Garden of Eden, it was actually E-D-I-N, right? [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2620.28s)]
*  And An-Lil, he was known as Yahweh. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2624.1600000000003s)]
*  He was the Lord. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2627.36s)]
*  He was known as Satan, the Lord of Eden. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2628.52s)]
*  Satan. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2632.92s)]
*  Satan. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2633.84s)]
*  The Lord of Eden. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2634.96s)]
*  And Eden was outside laboratory. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2636.36s)]
*  And in this laboratory, when you read these texts, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2638.52s)]
*  even some of the apocrypha texts, like the Book of Adam, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2640.6800000000003s)]
*  which was left out of the Bible, [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2643.88s)]
*  you discover that this was a mating ground. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2644.8s)]
*  So they would start. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2647.1200000000003s)]
*  So what happened first was they began with [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2648.0s)]
*  genetically modified people that were almost like clones. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2651.56s)]
*  And the information on the cloning technique [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2655.32s)]
*  is at the Temple of Karnak in Africa, in Egypt, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2657.6s)]
*  where I take people. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2659.48s)]
*  And also there's more evidence or talk about it [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2661.16s)]
*  at the Temple of Dendera. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2663.32s)]
*  And there's one more temple that has the birthing center. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2666.44s)]
*  I think it's the Temple of Isis. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2669.24s)]
*  And so they were making these people, [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2671.12s)]
*  but they couldn't make them fast enough. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2673.72s)]
*  And these people couldn't have sex [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2674.92s)]
*  and reproduce on their own. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2676.16s)]
*  So. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2677.52s)]
*  Then they got very frustrated. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2678.36s)]
*  So Isis says, okay, I have an idea. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2679.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm gonna take the egg out of one of the beings [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2683.2799999999997s)]
*  and put it in my womb and take it to term. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2685.7599999999998s)]
*  So it says in the text that they literally mixed [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2688.04s)]
*  their genetics with this egg, put it in her womb. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2690.8199999999997s)]
*  So that's now making what we call a zygote [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2696.0s)]
*  in modern technology terms, right? [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2698.16s)]
*  In vitro fertilization, puts it in her womb, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2700.3199999999997s)]
*  takes it to term for 10 months, [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2702.2s)]
*  and then gives birth to the Adamu, which means first man. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2704.16s)]
*  And there's a cylinder scroll in the British Museum [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2708.2s)]
*  where she's holding up the baby says, [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2709.9599999999996s)]
*  my hands have made it, the first man, Adamu. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2711.16s)]
*  So that's where we get the first genetically [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2714.68s)]
*  perfected homo sapien. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2716.52s)]
*  So before that they were all. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2718.6s)]
*  They were homo something, but they weren't like us. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2720.48s)]
*  They couldn't reproduce. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2723.3599999999997s)]
*  Like if you take a tiger and a lion and mate them, [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2724.2s)]
*  it'll have a ligand, but the ligand can't reproduce. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2727.7999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2730.44s)]
*  Right? [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2731.2799999999997s)]
*  So that's the situation. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2732.1s)]
*  That's what we had going on. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2733.04s)]
*  So funny. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2734.24s)]
*  This is so much fun. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2735.08s)]
*  So much fun. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2736.16s)]
*  It's vitiligo. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2737.0s)]
*  It's so much more fun to listen to you [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2738.24s)]
*  and just believe everything. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2740.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2741.9199999999996s)]
*  I'm telling you, it is. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2742.7599999999998s)]
*  I know there's people that listen right now like, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2743.72s)]
*  oh, this is bullshit. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2745.52s)]
*  Just get away from that and just enjoy today. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2746.68s)]
*  Just enjoy. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2749.2s)]
*  I want them to research what I'm saying. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2750.52s)]
*  They can rewind and write this stuff down [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2752.3599999999997s)]
*  or type it in their phone and start learning. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2754.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2757.2799999999997s)]
*  I want people to research what I say. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2758.12s)]
*  Don't believe what I say, research what I say. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2760.52s)]
*  So what happens is, and we take people [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2762.52s)]
*  to these cloning centers when we take them to Africa [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2764.68s)]
*  on tour, our tour we take every single year. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2767.3599999999997s)]
*  Next one is coming up in October. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2769.9599999999996s)]
*  And so the point I'm trying to make [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2771.72s)]
*  is so we have the cloning center. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2774.3999999999996s)]
*  The clones couldn't reproduce enough. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2776.08s)]
*  A lot of work was going into making these people. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2778.56s)]
*  So they came up with that. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2781.48s)]
*  This starts the generations of Isis, the generations of Isis, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2784.6s)]
*  the genesis, the genesis. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2789.3999999999996s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2791.72s)]
*  And Genesis is obviously the first book of the Old Testament. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2792.8399999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2795.3199999999997s)]
*  Doing the math right now. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2796.12s)]
*  He really is. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2797.12s)]
*  He's doing the math. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2797.9199999999996s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2800.72s)]
*  So that's Adam. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2801.72s)]
*  Yes, Adam. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2802.9599999999996s)]
*  Adam was then put into this Eden to mate with these other. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2803.9599999999996s)]
*  They had mating times and schedules. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2807.3199999999997s)]
*  You couldn't do it. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2808.8799999999997s)]
*  You couldn't make, get back what you're talking about. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2810.0s)]
*  You couldn't mate with somebody unless you were [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2811.48s)]
*  given a scheduled time to mate or you'd get in trouble [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2812.8799999999997s)]
*  and punished. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2815.0s)]
*  But no babies coming. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2816.3199999999997s)]
*  So I said, damn it. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2818.2799999999997s)]
*  So let's go ahead and take some of his DNA, clone that, [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2819.48s)]
*  make a woman to an imate Eve. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2822.8799999999997s)]
*  Then she got pregnant. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2825.3999999999996s)]
*  OK, this works. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2826.72s)]
*  They were not the first humans on this planet. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2828.24s)]
*  They were probably a million in at that point. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2831.4399999999996s)]
*  OK? [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2834.2799999999997s)]
*  So people who think that 8 billion people that we have now [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2835.08s)]
*  on Earth came from two people have never studied genetics. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2838.9599999999996s)]
*  Because if I start making, mating with my sister [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2842.9199999999996s)]
*  and so forth and so on, by the second generation, [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2845.52s)]
*  third generation, we're going to have a whole bunch of people [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2847.8799999999997s)]
*  with disabilities and one eye and arms broken and small legs [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2850.6s)]
*  and all kinds of stuff. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2854.24s)]
*  You can't make 8 billion people. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2855.04s)]
*  Not enough genetic diversity. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2856.4399999999996s)]
*  So that's why they had the specific mating times. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2858.56s)]
*  And the people that you could mate with to make sure [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2861.32s)]
*  that they were not creating a small genetic pool. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2863.64s)]
*  Once they figured that worked, they said, OK, [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2867.64s)]
*  let's isolate them in a certain part of the garden [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2869.64s)]
*  and begin to do this experiment with them. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2872.08s)]
*  So Kane had, I mean, Adam had Kane and Abel. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2874.6s)]
*  And Yahweh came back to check on his offerings one day. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2878.44s)]
*  And one was bringing him the harvest, [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2882.52s)]
*  one was bringing him the lamb. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2884.36s)]
*  And one got jealous because he kept taking the harvest. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2886.68s)]
*  And he's like, you know what, I'm pissed off. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2889.96s)]
*  I'm going to kill my brother. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2891.12s)]
*  So Kane kills Abel. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2892.3999999999996s)]
*  And God comes back, like he doesn't know this. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2894.12s)]
*  He's supposed to be all knowing and omnipotent. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2896.72s)]
*  He doesn't know that this happened. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2898.44s)]
*  He's shocked that this happens. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2899.68s)]
*  And he says, I got to kick you out of the garden. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2901.3999999999996s)]
*  And so Kane says in the Bible, he says, [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2905.04s)]
*  the people out there will kill me. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2908.44s)]
*  What people? [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2910.04s)]
*  I thought there's no people. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2911.3199999999997s)]
*  I thought there was no people out there. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2912.16s)]
*  There's people out there already. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2914.16s)]
*  Matter of fact, they might be barbaric. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2915.6s)]
*  So he says, don't worry, I will put my mark on you. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2917.7599999999998s)]
*  See, that's the brand. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2919.8399999999997s)]
*  Put my brand on you. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2921.72s)]
*  So he said, so that they will know your minds. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2922.56s)]
*  So he put a brand on people. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2925.36s)]
*  Hey, no, that's in Lil's guy. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2926.8399999999997s)]
*  Don't mess with him. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2928.44s)]
*  Don't fuck with him. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2929.2799999999997s)]
*  Exactly, that started the whole Canaanites. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2930.12s)]
*  See? [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2932.0s)]
*  That's where the Canaanites came out [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2933.08s)]
*  and built the whole thing. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2934.48s)]
*  And eventually migrated over to Mesoamerica. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2935.7999999999997s)]
*  So we're talking about, it's a big story, man. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2938.4s)]
*  It's a really, really big story. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2941.56s)]
*  But you can see where there's so much misinformation. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2943.04s)]
*  So Jesus, good guy or bad guy? [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2948.44s)]
*  I believe it was a good guy. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2950.24s)]
*  I think some of his words were twisted in the New Testament. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2951.44s)]
*  He never said, I don't believe he would say anything [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2954.72s)]
*  about slavery. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2956.0s)]
*  If you really look at the words of Jesus, [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2957.16s)]
*  what he's teaching, it comes from Thoth the Atlantean. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2958.8s)]
*  So either he is Thoth the Atlantean [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2962.0s)]
*  or he was taught by Thoth the Atlantean [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2963.88s)]
*  or he studied in the mystery schools [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2965.48s)]
*  to get that same knowledge. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2966.88s)]
*  Because I line up the verses in my book, [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2969.36s)]
*  Compendium of the Emerald Tabernacles. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2971.24s)]
*  I line up the words side by side [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2972.48s)]
*  so you can see what Jesus is saying [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2974.2s)]
*  was already said thousands of years prior. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2975.68s)]
*  He's teaching the ancient mysteries [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2978.24s)]
*  and he's trying to get mankind to enlighten himself [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2979.8399999999997s)]
*  through consciousness. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2981.8799999999997s)]
*  But Thoth the Atlantean was doing it [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2983.04s)]
*  to subjugate the human species. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2985.64s)]
*  No, he was helping. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2988.3599999999997s)]
*  He was helping. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2989.2s)]
*  He went around the planet helping everyone. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2990.04s)]
*  Oh, so he was helping. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2990.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, he was helping. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2991.72s)]
*  So this is after, so Thoth is after whoever created us [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2992.56s)]
*  and was subjugating us. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2996.96s)]
*  He was the, he's the son of Ea Enki. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=2998.56s)]
*  So he's the son of one of these rulers. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3001.2799999999997s)]
*  But he broke free from this tradition [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3004.0s)]
*  of enslaving humanity? [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3005.84s)]
*  He just wanted to help. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3007.48s)]
*  He would go and he would teach, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3008.32s)]
*  him and his father would go and teach humans. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3009.7599999999998s)]
*  His father would send him on secret missions [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3012.0s)]
*  to like raise vibration, raise energy. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3013.72s)]
*  Why did they wanna help out? [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3015.44s)]
*  What was that about? [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3016.52s)]
*  Well, Enki liked human women. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3017.52s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3020.04s)]
*  And so did Thoth. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3020.88s)]
*  So it was that simple. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3021.72s)]
*  Thoth married Maot. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3022.88s)]

*  all the Eninaki and all, and Thoth and all them? [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3034.0s)]
*  They had two wars. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3036.16s)]
*  The first pyramid war almost eradicated them, [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3037.68s)]
*  but they got, they started over again. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3039.8399999999997s)]
*  The second pyramid war, bad. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3042.08s)]
*  That one almost decimated the planet. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3045.16s)]
*  You see how when you look at earth, [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3047.56s)]
*  like from Google earth, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3049.68s)]

*  People say, oh, that's just natural geological formations [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3053.56s)]
*  over time. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3056.2s)]
*  This has become an arid desert. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3057.04s)]
*  No, that's war. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3058.92s)]

*  The buildings that they lived in turned to glass. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3077.68s)]
*  How can that be? [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3080.04s)]
*  We're talking about 3000 plus degree temperature [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3081.36s)]
*  weapons fire. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3084.16s)]
*  We're talking about this war that happened [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3085.44s)]
*  in the ancient past. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3087.36s)]
*  Amun-Ra wanted to continue his, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3088.7200000000003s)]
*  he started the first war to take over the earth early [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3091.52s)]
*  because he didn't want to wait for his processional period [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3094.7200000000003s)]
*  to rule. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3096.56s)]
*  And then this is the guy who says, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3097.76s)]
*  you must say amen after everything. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3099.4s)]
*  You say amen, everything you give thanks for, [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3101.12s)]
*  you're saying amen to him. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3103.16s)]
*  So when you say amen, you're thanking him, by the way. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3104.0s)]
*  A brutal killing guy. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3106.36s)]
*  But anyway, so he says, it's a fact. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3107.76s)]
*  So he started one war to take over early, which he won. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3110.2400000000002s)]
*  He started a second war to stay in power. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3114.52s)]
*  In that second war, he escaped. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3118.16s)]
*  He was almost killed, but he left his kingship [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3121.24s)]
*  and the finances of the kingdom to the Ra-Kam. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3124.12s)]
*  And R-A-K-A-M, but that translates into modern words, [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3128.04s)]
*  kam, translates into childs. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3132.92s)]
*  So now you translate ra-childs, ra-childs. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3135.28s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3138.92s)]
*  Got him. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3141.72s)]
*  I thought he was going to Ra-Kam. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3142.56s)]
*  Got him. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3145.36s)]
*  See, right to his head. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3146.2000000000003s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3147.32s)]
*  Ra-Kam ends up being the Rothschild banking dynasty. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3148.32s)]
*  Yeah, $700 trillion dynasty. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3153.08s)]
*  Wow. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3154.7200000000003s)]
*  Still running the plan until this day. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3155.52s)]
*  Are they really? [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3156.92s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3157.7200000000003s)]
*  They run all the banks, all the central banking systems. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3158.52s)]
*  Oh, tell them. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3160.44s)]
*  Globally. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3161.2400000000002s)]
*  This is awesome. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3162.04s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3163.56s)]
*  It's like my YouTube wormhole live. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3165.0s)]
*  OK, OK. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3168.4s)]
*  So Ra-Kam ends up being the Rothschild banking dynasty. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3169.44s)]
*  But didn't the Rothschild banking dynasty [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3173.8s)]
*  start in like Austria or something in modern times? [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3175.44s)]
*  Like, how do you jump? [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3179.04s)]
*  How do we jump? [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3180.6400000000003s)]
*  When you have these kind of people [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3181.32s)]
*  that you put in positions of power, [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3183.32s)]
*  and they continue to fund and help each other, [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3186.6400000000003s)]
*  they always find a way to get back to where they want to be. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3189.0800000000004s)]
*  Because there's only one recipe. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3192.4s)]
*  And once you understand and know the recipe, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3193.96s)]
*  you can start from zero and get it all back. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3196.2400000000002s)]
*  And what is the recipe? [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3198.48s)]
*  Well, it's the recipe to building [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3199.88s)]
*  any kind of level of success. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3201.2400000000002s)]
*  I had a business that I built into a very big business, [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3202.52s)]
*  and I lost everything. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3204.84s)]
*  Long time ago, I was homeless. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3205.96s)]
*  I was sleeping in my car on the beach in North Miami, [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3207.68s)]
*  or Aventura. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3211.96s)]
*  And somebody lent me $30. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3214.0s)]
*  I put $10 in my gas tank. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3215.32s)]
*  And the other $20, I converted to quarters. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3217.08s)]
*  This is in the 90s. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3218.96s)]
*  I got the yellow pages out, and I started cold calling [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3220.04s)]
*  businesses to get out of the marketing company, [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3222.24s)]
*  getting new accounts. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3224.56s)]
*  I got me some new accounts. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3225.92s)]
*  I built my business back up. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3227.08s)]
*  I got off the street, got a new car, got a new house, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3228.64s)]
*  became a multimillionaire again. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3230.8s)]
*  And so the recipe, understanding what it takes [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3233.32s)]
*  to be successful, once it's ingrained in you, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3235.04s)]
*  it never changes. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3237.0s)]
*  I don't care what business it is. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3237.84s)]
*  They could be selling cow chips from Wisconsin. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3238.88s)]
*  You'll be a billionaire. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3240.88s)]
*  And so they understood that it was in their DNA. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3242.2400000000002s)]
*  Can you tell us what that is? [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3245.12s)]
*  We want to learn about it. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3246.36s)]
*  I teach classes on this, as a matter of fact. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3247.2000000000003s)]
*  Give us a little tidbit. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3249.4s)]
*  Well, one thing you have to know, [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3251.36s)]
*  obviously, if you have to be passionate [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3252.56s)]
*  about what you're doing. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3254.04s)]
*  See, they're passionate about putting their boot [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3255.28s)]
*  on people's necks and ruling. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3257.12s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3258.32s)]
*  They're passionate. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3259.12s)]
*  I remember one of the Roth trials. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3259.92s)]
*  Which one it was, I don't know if it was Evelyn [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3261.2799999999997s)]
*  or the other one. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3262.8799999999997s)]
*  He says, we have the right to rule over people. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3263.72s)]
*  It's that statement. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3267.7599999999998s)]
*  They believe that they have the right to rule over us [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3269.48s)]
*  and to oversee us. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3273.3999999999996s)]
*  They believe that's their genetic lineage. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3275.0s)]
*  So if you're passionate about something, [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3277.96s)]
*  you're gonna do it to its highest level [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3280.04s)]
*  and it's never gonna feel like you worked a day [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3282.3199999999997s)]
*  in your life. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3283.7999999999997s)]
*  So the trick to becoming successful [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3284.64s)]
*  is to find your passion. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3286.6s)]
*  And then lean in. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3287.7999999999997s)]
*  And then find a need for that passion in the world. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3288.64s)]
*  Once you find a need for the passion in the world, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3290.36s)]
*  then you supply that passion to the person [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3292.92s)]
*  or company that needs it. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3295.2000000000003s)]
*  Now that energy exchange puts money in your bank account. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3296.92s)]
*  So you never chase the money. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3300.0s)]
*  I never focused on how much money I can make. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3301.6000000000004s)]
*  I was focused on following my passion [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3303.7200000000003s)]
*  and providing that passion to the world. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3305.36s)]
*  Money is just a side effect of the energy exchange. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3307.2000000000003s)]
*  That's the recipe. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3310.0800000000004s)]
*  And then these central banks [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3312.04s)]
*  that the Roth childs have created, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3313.8s)]
*  is there any benefit to them? [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3316.36s)]
*  Like, is it nice to have a central bank? [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3317.6400000000003s)]
*  Like if you were to make the argument for them, [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3319.7599999999998s)]
*  what would you say? [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3321.48s)]
*  Well listen, I mean hey, [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3322.3199999999997s)]
*  I mean anyone who can make trillions of dollars [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3323.3599999999997s)]
*  off of money that doesn't exist. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3325.24s)]
*  It's pretty good, though. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3327.3199999999997s)]
*  Pretty good damn deal. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3328.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3329.0s)]
*  I just punch a couple zeros and zeros and ones [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3329.9599999999996s)]
*  into a computer and then all of a sudden [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3332.04s)]
*  it turns into trillions of dollars [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3333.3199999999997s)]
*  of money that backed by absolutely nothing [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3334.9599999999996s)]
*  but consciousness attribution. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3337.04s)]
*  If we had a billion dollars in this room right now [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3339.6s)]
*  and it was negative 30 and we had to sleep here overnight, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3342.3599999999997s)]
*  knowing that we're gonna get pulmonary edema [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3345.6s)]
*  from breathing in cold air, we'd burn it. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3347.2s)]
*  Because now the value of the money is only heat [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3350.68s)]
*  to keep us alive for one more day. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3352.56s)]
*  Money is just what we consciously attribute to it. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3355.08s)]
*  So how they convinced us that we should consciously [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3357.7999999999997s)]
*  attribute value to this money. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3361.04s)]
*  Goes back to the Sumerian tablets. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3363.2799999999997s)]
*  You go back, you discover where the whole thing [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3365.3599999999997s)]
*  was implemented, where these Anunnaki gods [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3366.9199999999996s)]
*  put this monetary system in place thousands of years ago. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3369.3999999999996s)]
*  And they said okay, if you, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3373.24s)]
*  we're gonna have to really monetize this system [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3375.48s)]
*  that we're creating. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3378.3199999999997s)]
*  You have lambs, you have apple orchards. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3379.3199999999997s)]
*  You bring two satchels of apples, [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3382.3599999999997s)]
*  that's the value of one lamb. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3384.08s)]
*  If when you get to him, he only has, doesn't have a lamb, [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3386.04s)]
*  he's gonna give you an IOU. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3388.8799999999997s)]
*  And we have millions of IOUs in Cuneiform. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3390.72s)]
*  We discovered them. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3394.72s)]
*  So I go to him, the first time I get my lamb, I go home. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3395.92s)]
*  The second time I come back, it's now offspring time. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3398.8799999999997s)]
*  He only has enough to give me a half a lamb. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3401.7999999999997s)]
*  I gotta give him two satchels of apples. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3403.7599999999998s)]
*  I get a half a lamb and an IOU for another half. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3405.24s)]
*  I come back a month later, man, [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3407.48s)]
*  this is shortage of lambs now. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3409.36s)]
*  This is fractional reserve banking that you're describing. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3411.12s)]
*  I give you a leg and I give you a head. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3413.68s)]
*  So this is really a function, my understanding is [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3416.6s)]
*  this is a function of like the, [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3419.2400000000002s)]
*  the problem is really the weight of gold. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3421.72s)]
*  Like at least when it entered like the true banking system [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3425.04s)]
*  in Europe. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3428.0s)]
*  Like it's hard to just carry your gold around all the time. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3428.84s)]
*  So then if somebody has your gold, [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3431.8s)]
*  they can give you the IOUs for the gold, [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3434.28s)]
*  you can pay in those IOUs knowing full well [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3437.12s)]
*  there's gold in there. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3439.2000000000003s)]
*  But if you start handing out more IOUs than there is gold, [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3440.32s)]
*  nobody's gonna ask, [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3444.56s)]
*  cause we all believe the gold is there, [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3445.8s)]
*  but it's not really there. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3447.28s)]
*  And that's kind of our banking system. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3448.36s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3449.8s)]
*  Right now. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3450.6400000000003s)]
*  And that's, that's when people say, [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3451.48s)]
*  I think banks only need to have like 10% or 20% [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3452.76s)]
*  of their actual funds in the bank itself. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3455.04s)]
*  Correct. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3457.6800000000003s)]
*  If we all went to the bank today and said, [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3458.52s)]
*  give me my money, the banking system would collapse [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3460.04s)]
*  because everyone would not get their money. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3462.56s)]
*  It'd be impossible to get your money out. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3464.48s)]
*  Yeah, let's not do that. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3467.56s)]
*  No, yeah, that'd be a bad situation. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3468.3999999999996s)]
*  That'd be a really bad day. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3470.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3471.16s)]
*  And that's what people call, [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3472.64s)]
*  that's the run on the bank term, right? [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3473.8799999999997s)]
*  When there's an economic collapse [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3476.7599999999998s)]
*  and everybody wants to go take their money out [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3478.3599999999997s)]
*  and then the bank goes, [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3479.7999999999997s)]
*  hey, we're stopping withdrawals today [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3480.64s)]
*  because it's too much. It's like shorting the stock. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3482.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3484.68s)]
*  All right guys, let's take a break for a second. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3485.52s)]
*  Listen, let's just face it, okay? [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3486.8799999999997s)]
*  After a night with drinks, [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3488.48s)]
*  we don't bounce back the next day like we used to. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3490.48s)]
*  I'm 40 years old, okay? [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3493.3999999999996s)]
*  Even a night of responsible drinking after some shows [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3495.12s)]
*  can ruin the next day completely. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3498.2799999999997s)]
*  But luckily, there is now a surefire way [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3500.8399999999997s)]
*  to wake up feeling fresh after a night of drinking [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3504.08s)]
*  and it's with Zbiotics. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3507.0s)]
*  Zbiotics is the world's first genetically engineered [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3509.72s)]
*  pre-alcohol probiotic, okay? [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3513.44s)]
*  Let me explain this here. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3515.72s)]
*  When you drink alcohol, [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3516.88s)]
*  it gets converted into a toxic byproduct in your gut, okay? [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3518.68s)]
*  It's this byproduct, not the dehydration, [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3523.36s)]
*  which is what they tell you, [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3526.1200000000003s)]
*  that's to blame for your rough next day. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3527.4s)]
*  Zbiotics is a probiotic drink that produces an enzyme [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3529.92s)]
*  to break this byproduct down. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3534.32s)]
*  So just remember to make Zbiotics your first drink [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3536.42s)]
*  of the night, drink responsibly, [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3539.28s)]
*  and you'll feel your best tomorrow. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3541.0s)]
*  You have this in the tummy first, [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3543.38s)]
*  then you have those responsible drinks, [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3545.38s)]
*  but the Zbiotic is already cooking, is getting to work, [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3549.54s)]
*  it's producing that little enzyme, [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3552.2s)]
*  it's breaking down that gut byproduct [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3553.7999999999997s)]
*  that has been really causing you [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3558.3599999999997s)]

*  we're telling you it's possible, [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3639.16s)]

*  delivery and promotions available only in select markets. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3663.0800000000004s)]
*  Now let's get back to the show. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3666.2400000000002s)]
*  Can you talk to us about the pyramids? [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3667.36s)]
*  What are pyramids, why do they show up in every culture, [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3669.16s)]
*  and what is the function of them? [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3671.48s)]
*  And can I just say one thing? [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3672.96s)]
*  Because some people would say the pyramid [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3674.7999999999997s)]
*  is just the easiest physical structure [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3676.64s)]
*  to create at that size, right? [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3680.7599999999998s)]
*  Because if you create a building, [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3683.3199999999997s)]
*  they just go straight up, [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3684.3199999999997s)]
*  wind can rocket side by side, [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3685.44s)]
*  and it goes, whereas a pyramid [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3687.08s)]
*  is just the most stable structure. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3688.44s)]
*  So that would be like the, [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3690.2s)]
*  what do you call the mainstream thought? [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3691.8799999999997s)]
*  What is that, what do you refer to? [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3693.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm just saying that it's, you know, [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3695.04s)]
*  it's a, you know, the power's a barrier to it. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3696.56s)]
*  What do you call mainstream thinking in your discipline? [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3699.28s)]
*  Do you call it a, what is that a, [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3702.52s)]
*  you talking about the ease of movement? [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3704.68s)]
*  No, no, the term that you would use [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3706.04s)]
*  for like what they teach in school. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3707.36s)]
*  Oh, mainstream, we just call it mainstream. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3709.52s)]
*  Okay, so the mainstream thinking would be the boring one, [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3710.36s)]
*  the one that we didn't ask you to come on this show [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3713.68s)]
*  to talk about at all. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3716.04s)]
*  So please do not say, [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3717.12s)]
*  oh, the physics weren't the best for a pyramid. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3718.16s)]
*  But they would just go, hey, [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3720.2s)]
*  if you, when kids are building with blocks, [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3721.84s)]
*  they eventually realize if they build a tutel, [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3724.12s)]
*  it falls down. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3726.0s)]
*  So let's build in this way, [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3727.12s)]
*  and then that creates a pyramid. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3728.92s)]
*  But I'm sure you have something way more interesting. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3730.84s)]
*  So I'll go into the structure of the pyramid [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3733.04s)]
*  and constructing it, and I'll go into why. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3734.88s)]
*  So what's interesting is the pyramids. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3736.72s)]
*  Is there any time where you're reading this [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3739.88s)]
*  and like you see an explanation [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3741.7599999999998s)]
*  that makes a little bit more sense, [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3743.24s)]
*  and you're just like, oh, that shit sucks? [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3744.48s)]
*  No, I look into everything. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3746.88s)]
*  See, what I do is I research everything, [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3748.96s)]
*  and sometimes over time, [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3750.84s)]
*  some of my theories evolve. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3753.08s)]
*  Good. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3754.48s)]
*  And I think that's a true sign [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3755.3199999999997s)]
*  of someone who's really seeking real knowledge. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3756.52s)]
*  Yeah, but don't evolve them too born. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3758.36s)]
*  Versus somebody who, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3760.04s)]
*  versus somebody who's into dogma. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3761.6s)]
*  Because once I get so hard set into my own theories, [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3763.24s)]
*  and I'm not willing to take any new input, [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3767.12s)]
*  now I'm just a preacher at a church. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3770.04s)]
*  Facts. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3771.7599999999998s)]
*  Literally, I'm just preaching dogma at that point. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3772.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3775.24s)]
*  Today, it's church. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3776.44s)]
*  I just wanna let you know. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3778.4s)]
*  Okay. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3779.24s)]
*  This is church. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3780.08s)]
*  You can preach all you want. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3781.64s)]
*  So, well. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3783.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3784.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3785.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3786.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3787.4s)]
*  Barely getting loose. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3788.2400000000002s)]
*  We might need some tequila. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3789.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3790.7200000000003s)]
*  Reverend Carson. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3791.5600000000004s)]
*  Do you drink at all? [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3792.4s)]
*  I don't drink, no. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3793.2400000000002s)]
*  Okay, nothing. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3794.0800000000004s)]
*  I don't smoke either. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3794.92s)]
*  Nothing? [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3795.76s)]
*  Yeah, nothing. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3796.6000000000004s)]
*  Really? [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3797.44s)]
*  What about DMT? [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3798.28s)]
*  Just water. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3799.1200000000003s)]
*  Or mushrooms? [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3799.96s)]
*  I just do water. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3800.8s)]
*  Water and coffee. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3801.6400000000003s)]
*  I'm sure you've heard of the profound effects of psychedelics. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3802.48s)]
*  A lot of great effects. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3805.96s)]
*  A lot of people have helped a lot of people. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3806.8s)]
*  I have nothing against it. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3809.36s)]
*  I'm talking on the ancients. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3810.28s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3811.6800000000003s)]
*  I talk about it in my podcast. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3813.36s)]
*  It's real ancient stuff, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3814.6s)]
*  but it will rewire your brain. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3816.52s)]
*  And so once I read that, [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3819.84s)]
*  because I research everything before I do anything, [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3821.48s)]
*  I realized, well, [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3823.56s)]
*  I like the way my brain is structured right now. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3825.04s)]
*  So you don't wanna rewire. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3827.2s)]
*  If there's any slight risk [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3828.12s)]
*  that I could lose my memory system, [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3829.4s)]
*  it scares me. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3832.6s)]
*  Yeah, that's reasonable. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3833.44s)]
*  Because my memory system is really good. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3834.28s)]
*  Like my ability, my recall capability. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3835.6s)]
*  Yeah, your attention is on point. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3837.88s)]
*  So I'm like, what if I do this and I lose that? [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3839.7599999999998s)]
*  Not that I'm afraid to do it. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3843.04s)]
*  I don't wanna lose my foul cabinet. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3844.96s)]
*  That's really all it is. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3847.2799999999997s)]
*  Have you always been like that? [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3849.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm just curious. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3850.4399999999996s)]
*  Like since you were a child? [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3851.2799999999997s)]
*  Since I was a child, yeah. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3852.12s)]
*  I started reading at one. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3852.96s)]
*  I was reading at 10 months child books, [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3853.7999999999997s)]
*  but by one I was reading real books. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3855.3999999999996s)]
*  I read my first, as a toddler, [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3857.72s)]
*  I read my first novel, [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3859.0s)]
*  which was The Sea Wolf by Jack London. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3860.4399999999996s)]
*  Not that big of a novel, but I read it. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3864.24s)]
*  So anyway, the pyramids. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3866.7999999999997s)]
*  Now let's take a look at the structure. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3869.0s)]
*  How do you even understand the things in the book? [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3870.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3874.32s)]
*  I just, I always knew stuff. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3875.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3877.08s)]
*  I had a brother who was only one year younger than me. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3877.92s)]
*  And my sister was six years younger than me. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3880.56s)]
*  And I would look at them and I'd say, [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3883.7200000000003s)]
*  these are real kids. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3885.64s)]
*  They're like babies. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3886.48s)]
*  But nobody could see what I could see. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3887.8s)]
*  I told my mom. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3891.2000000000003s)]
*  Did you think that your siblings were stupid? [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3892.04s)]
*  No, I just thought that they were babies. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3895.12s)]
*  So you knew that you were operating as an adult. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3896.84s)]
*  Yeah, something was a little different. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3901.1200000000003s)]
*  Got it. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3901.96s)]
*  But you thought that the expectation for them was normal [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3902.8s)]
*  and you were different. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3905.48s)]
*  Yeah, cause I tried to talk to them about myself [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3906.48s)]
*  and they just couldn't, they couldn't even understand [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3908.32s)]
*  what I was trying to tell them. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3912.44s)]
*  So I gave up. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3913.76s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3915.32s)]
*  I've been walking around for decades [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3916.1600000000003s)]
*  with all this stuff in my head, [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3917.28s)]
*  just kind of like wandering through [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3918.44s)]
*  through the wastelands of life. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3920.1600000000003s)]
*  Who do you think read more, you or Cat Williams? [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3921.96s)]
*  Cat Williams read more. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3924.88s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3925.7200000000003s)]
*  You don't think you got cat? [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3926.5600000000004s)]
*  I'm not gonna compete with him. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3928.4s)]
*  You don't think you got cat? [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3929.2400000000002s)]
*  I read over a thousand scriptures, cylinders. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3931.08s)]
*  I have 1500 books in my house that I've read. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3933.04s)]
*  That's one, but I've read over a thousand scriptures, [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3934.68s)]
*  cylinder scrolls, papyruses, ancient texts, tablets, [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3936.7999999999997s)]
*  you name it from all around the world. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3940.96s)]
*  Take that cat. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3942.4s)]
*  But I'm not gonna take anything away from him. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3944.44s)]
*  Whatever he said he read, he read. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3946.48s)]
*  So yeah. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3948.68s)]
*  Okay, period. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3949.52s)]
*  Okay, period. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3950.36s)]
*  So let's look at first thing, the structure. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3951.18s)]
*  Okay, these blocks are all different. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3952.7599999999998s)]
*  They're not the same exact size. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3955.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3957.04s)]
*  They're all custom made and custom fit. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3957.88s)]
*  So the Lego theory would work. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3960.12s)]
*  If it was all. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3962.76s)]
*  If the blocks were all the same. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3963.7200000000003s)]
*  In other words, I know these blocks go for this particularly. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3966.0s)]
*  These blocks are gonna be the same size. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3968.28s)]
*  No matter what, I can stack them over here [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3969.6400000000003s)]
*  or intermingle them. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3971.44s)]
*  Every block is individually custom made [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3972.7200000000003s)]
*  to fit right where it is. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3976.12s)]
*  So that becomes very, very difficult. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3978.8s)]
*  It's like the great pyramid, over 2 million blocks of stone [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3980.6800000000003s)]
*  and nobody realized that they're all different. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3985.4s)]
*  So each individual stone is totally different [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3987.96s)]
*  from the other one. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3991.48s)]
*  Which means you can't make a cookie cutter [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3992.84s)]
*  and say, okay, we got these blocks ready. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3995.32s)]
*  Let's stack them up. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3997.6s)]
*  Didn't quite work that way because they're all different. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=3999.2400000000002s)]
*  Now you have to take into consideration also [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4002.32s)]
*  the subterranean part of the great pyramid. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4005.0s)]
*  The subterranean, like the subterranean shaft [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4008.28s)]
*  which cuts through solid stone and goes down 65 meters. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4010.44s)]
*  Then another 30 meters down beneath that, [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4013.44s)]
*  which I've been down there. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4015.28s)]
*  How in the world did they cut that through solid stones [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4017.0s)]
*  that were already stacked? [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4019.4s)]
*  Some type of a laser cutting tool. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4020.72s)]
*  And if you look at the mud ramp theory, [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4022.92s)]
*  the floating theory is a farce. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4025.52s)]
*  You can't float these stones. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4027.16s)]
*  The second thing we look at would be the mud ramp theory. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4028.6s)]
*  The floating theory really quick is the idea was [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4030.92s)]
*  that the Nile ran right up against, I think the pyramid. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4033.16s)]
*  So they were taking the stones from the Aswan Valley, [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4035.92s)]
*  I'm pretty sure. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4038.16s)]
*  Some of the granite from Aswan [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4039.0s)]
*  and then some of the stones from not too far away. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4040.12s)]
*  But the idea is that you could float them up the Nile [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4042.4s)]
*  so they weren't. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4044.72s)]
*  Because the original theory I think was [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4045.8s)]
*  that they were rolling them across the sand [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4047.32s)]
*  and people were like, how could you possibly do that? [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4049.52s)]
*  But the floating theory, I guess makes sense [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4051.7200000000003s)]
*  in terms of a human's capability to move a heavy object. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4054.88s)]
*  But you have to displace the mass. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4058.7200000000003s)]
*  What are you displacing mass with [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4061.5600000000004s)]
*  for that level of mass in water? [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4063.2400000000002s)]
*  Highly unlikely that they would be able to [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4065.88s)]
*  displace that much mass and keep them floating. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4067.92s)]
*  Otherwise they'd sink. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4069.8s)]
*  I mean, look at all the mafia movies. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4071.0s)]
*  They just throw you in. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4072.6400000000003s)]
*  And you don't come back up. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4073.84s)]
*  And you have a lot of air in your lungs too. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4076.36s)]
*  Yeah, what were they using? [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4079.08s)]
*  Fuck, there's like a video of this. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4080.36s)]
*  What were they using to keep them afloat? [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4082.2000000000003s)]
*  Oh, I forget, palm leaves or something. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4084.2400000000002s)]
*  It was something ridiculous. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4086.6000000000004s)]
*  It wasn't too bright. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4087.84s)]
*  It was on logs or something like that maybe? [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4089.28s)]
*  Anyway, go on. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4090.92s)]
*  Anyway, so you have that, [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4091.76s)]
*  but then also you have to take a look at the mud ramp theory, [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4092.84s)]
*  which is you need more mass than the Great Pyramid in mud [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4096.16s)]
*  to actually have the mud ramps. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4100.12s)]
*  So now you have to move more mass [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4102.08s)]
*  than the two billion blocks to make the ramp. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4104.56s)]
*  Again, it doesn't make any sense. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4106.84s)]
*  The ramp is how they were building the pyramid up [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4108.28s)]
*  in that way, so you need a ramp to bring the blocks up. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4112.24s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4115.32s)]
*  And then when you get on top, do they just slide down? [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4116.44s)]
*  Like I'm so confused about how you finish that final stone. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4118.48s)]
*  It's a bad theory. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4121.84s)]
*  It's a bad, bad theory. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4122.68s)]
*  I guess you could. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4124.32s)]
*  So once you start really analyzing the stones, [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4125.16s)]
*  the structures, the way that they're interlocked, [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4127.84s)]
*  you see there's an interlocking design system [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4130.4s)]
*  and each stone is custom made to be put in place, [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4133.36s)]
*  which means it needs to be created [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4136.32s)]
*  at the moment that it's needed. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4139.12s)]
*  How do you do that? [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4141.719999999999s)]
*  You're gonna get this stone up this mud ramp [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4143.2s)]
*  or float it up into this area [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4146.139999999999s)]
*  and then put it into a spot that it doesn't really fit? [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4148.0199999999995s)]
*  Oh, I made a mistake. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4150.04s)]
*  It doesn't go here. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4150.92s)]
*  Doesn't make any sense. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4152.16s)]
*  The blueprint for the Great Pyramid, for example, [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4154.4s)]
*  was so sound, they had foreknowledge [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4156.96s)]
*  of exactly how to build it and why. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4160.08s)]
*  And so you see that these stones were made and cut [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4162.36s)]
*  and put into place exactly precisely when needed. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4165.04s)]
*  It didn't take 20 years, in my opinion. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4168.76s)]
*  It probably took maybe less than a year [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4170.2s)]
*  to build that pyramid. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4171.6s)]
*  Now, what's the purpose of the Great Pyramid? [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4173.72s)]
*  Why? [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4175.84s)]
*  Why less than a year? [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4176.68s)]
*  Well, if you look at the, I took my... [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4177.5199999999995s)]
*  I've been there. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4181.16s)]
*  I've seen it. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4181.98s)]
*  Yeah, I took my Geiger counter [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4182.82s)]
*  and my compass and everything else. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4183.66s)]
*  And you start to realize that this is so high tech. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4187.12s)]
*  It's like throwing up a house in my neighborhood. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4192.32s)]
*  It takes them 18 months to throw a house up. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4194.04s)]
*  This is not one of those things [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4196.92s)]
*  where we're trying to figure it out as we go. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4198.259999999999s)]
*  This is something that has been done so many times. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4200.36s)]
*  It's common knowledge. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4202.92s)]
*  So this is advanced planning. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4204.36s)]
*  They had the logistics and the schematics all built out. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4205.799999999999s)]
*  You need to for how sophisticated it is. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4209.04s)]
*  I subscribe to them. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4211.0s)]
*  They're not throwing it all together. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4212.36s)]
*  Well, check this out. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4213.32s)]
*  The Great Pyramid, if you calculating [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4214.64s)]
*  by the size of the base and the size of the stones, [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4216.6s)]
*  you can calculate the time 365 days in a year. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4220.64s)]
*  You can calculate the distance from the earth to the moon. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4224.68s)]
*  You can calculate the distance from the earth to the sun. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4227.12s)]
*  You can calculate the speed of the earth around the sun, [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4229.6s)]
*  the speed of the earth on its axis, [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4232.72s)]
*  the speed of the sun around the Milky Way galaxy [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4235.6s)]
*  and the speed of the Milky Way galaxy [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4238.200000000001s)]
*  around the local cluster [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4239.68s)]
*  all from the Great Pyramid mathematics. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4241.320000000001s)]
*  Now you gotta tell me how in the world did that fit in [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4244.84s)]
*  with the rolling logs, the water or the mud ramp? [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4247.4s)]
*  We're talking about advanced technology, advanced beings [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4250.84s)]
*  that made that pyramid as a time capsule [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4254.38s)]
*  of incredible knowledge, a star map even is built into it [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4256.48s)]
*  to tell us who was here in ancient past [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4259.78s)]
*  and who did it and how. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4262.4s)]
*  When you take all the temples that are around the pyramid [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4263.88s)]
*  and the other two pyramids that are next to it [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4267.2s)]
*  and you look at it from the sky looking down [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4269.599999999999s)]
*  and you connect them, [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4271.8s)]
*  you get a inner planet system of our solar system. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4273.4800000000005s)]
*  You get the sun in the middle, [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4278.2s)]
*  you get Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4280.12s)]
*  So you get the interplanetary solar system [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4283.12s)]
*  from Giza looking straight down. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4284.96s)]
*  And what's incredible is when you take the NASA [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4287.6s)]
*  interplanetary solar map and you overlay it on that diagram [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4290.16s)]
*  it matches down to the millimeter. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4295.16s)]
*  Was NASA around back then? [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4299.2s)]
*  No. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4301.04s)]
*  I'm just asking for a friend. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4301.96s)]
*  So obviously they knew what the hell they were doing. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4303.5199999999995s)]
*  And also the distance from the sun to the earth [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4306.0s)]
*  and to all these other planets by the astronomical unit [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4308.92s)]
*  which is in astrophysics. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4311.5199999999995s)]
*  How'd they get that? [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4313.24s)]
*  The grand gallery leading up to the King's chamber, [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4314.1s)]
*  the longitude is the exact digits of the speed of light [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4317.0s)]
*  in meters per second. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4319.6s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4320.88s)]
*  Meters didn't exist back then. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4321.72s)]
*  That like stair tunnel that goes there? [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4323.24s)]
*  Really? [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4325.7s)]
*  Yeah, the location is the exact digits of the speed of light [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4326.54s)]
*  in meters per second. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4329.56s)]
*  But guess what I found? [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4331.04s)]
*  What's that? [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4332.4400000000005s)]
*  I found proto-Sumerian cuneiform in Mesoamerica on pottery [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4333.26s)]
*  and also tablets that show a proto-Sumerian metric system. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4339.400000000001s)]
*  And I didn't find it myself obviously [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4345.8s)]
*  but I found the record of it and documentation of it. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4347.52s)]
*  It's legitimate. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4349.96s)]
*  And so the metric system existed long before [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4351.56s)]
*  that French guy discovered it. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4354.84s)]
*  He only rediscovered what already existed. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4356.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4358.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4359.2s)]
*  So it's like, man, then you look at the pyramid, [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4360.04s)]
*  it was sitting on top of an aquifer. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4361.88s)]
*  The aquifer is dry now because the Nile is gone, [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4364.2s)]
*  the war happened and everything else. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4366.5599999999995s)]
*  But when you have running water underneath [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4368.44s)]
*  magnetized crystal granite, you get physiostatic electricity. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4370.48s)]
*  Those ions push up into the grand gallery. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4373.96s)]
*  Some of the water comes up [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4378.719999999999s)]
*  and goes down into the Queen's chamber. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4379.96s)]
*  I'll talk about that in a second. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4381.639999999999s)]
*  The energy from those ions moves up into the King's chamber. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4383.04s)]
*  It stepped up. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4386.2s)]
*  Well, before it had to have that little box there, [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4387.04s)]
*  the box was added by the way. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4389.72s)]
*  Before that box was there, [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4391.88s)]
*  it had the capability of creating fusion [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4392.92s)]
*  and sending electricity through apex. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4394.84s)]
*  When the pyramid was broken, the structure was broken, [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4396.76s)]
*  they added that box. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4399.32s)]
*  That box is the same exact dimensions [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4400.64s)]
*  as the Ark of the Covenant. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4403.0s)]
*  The Ark of the Covenant was there. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4404.64s)]
*  The box you're talking about is that like tomb-like structure? [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4405.48s)]
*  That rose granite box that's inside, yeah. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4408.2s)]
*  Yeah, how would they even get that in there? [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4410.48s)]
*  Yeah, they added it later on. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4412.24s)]
*  How did they get, I think they, a lot of the stuff, [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4414.32s)]
*  I think they teleporter or manifested. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4415.92s)]
*  But, well, look, listen to this, check this out. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4419.0s)]
*  Let me tell you. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4422.4400000000005s)]
*  Let me tell you where I get that from. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4423.28s)]
*  Let me take that, get it from. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4425.4400000000005s)]
*  Listen. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4427.04s)]
*  Listen to me. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4427.88s)]
*  In the animal tablets, listen to me. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4429.68s)]
*  Now I'm gonna give you some science now. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4432.12s)]
*  Okay. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4433.64s)]
*  In the animal tablets. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4434.4800000000005s)]
*  Give us some science. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4435.32s)]
*  Listen to me. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4436.64s)]
*  In the animal tablets, [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4438.28s)]
*  Thoth talks about manifesting solid matter. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4439.12s)]
*  He talks about it in a specific way, [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4442.64s)]
*  manifesting solid matter. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4444.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean, it is when you're in there, insane to get this to. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4446.68s)]
*  Well, let me tell you. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4448.72s)]
*  Let me tell you. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4449.56s)]
*  He manifests solid matter from photons [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4450.400000000001s)]
*  and cymatic frequencies. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4453.360000000001s)]
*  Cymatic frequencies. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4454.68s)]
*  What is that? [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4456.56s)]
*  Sound waves. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4457.400000000001s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4458.360000000001s)]
*  So we know that in string theory and quantum physics [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4459.52s)]
*  that the way that the universe is formed and shaped [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4462.0s)]
*  is all based on vibrating microscopic strings [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4464.68s)]
*  that are emanating matter into existence. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4467.4800000000005s)]
*  Through this frequency creates the illusion of reality. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4470.64s)]
*  He's talking about this 36,000 years ago. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4473.84s)]
*  Well, just five years ago, [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4476.88s)]
*  two scientists in a laboratory in the UK [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4479.360000000001s)]
*  used for the first time ever photons and cymanics [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4482.16s)]
*  to manifest solid matter in a laboratory, [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4485.400000000001s)]
*  duplicatable, became peer-reviewed science. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4487.52s)]
*  Peer-reviewed science. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4489.96s)]
*  Okay, so they've created. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4490.8s)]
*  So we've now rediscovered a way to create mass, [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4491.64s)]
*  matter from photons and sound frequencies. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4494.0s)]
*  And I'm imagining they're doing this [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4496.92s)]
*  on a microscopic level. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4499.12s)]
*  Yes, on a very small level. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4500.28s)]
*  But the idea is if it could be done on a very small level, [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4501.64s)]
*  then it could potentially be done on a very large level. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4504.320000000001s)]
*  Now you're talking about literally [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4506.64s)]
*  manifesting entire structures. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4508.240000000001s)]
*  Oh. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4510.64s)]
*  You send into the computer the blueprint you want. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4511.4800000000005s)]
*  So this is 3D printing. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4514.4400000000005s)]
*  And this thing prints out a whole building like this. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4515.52s)]
*  When I went to Angkor Wat, [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4519.280000000001s)]
*  before I get back to the pyramids, [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4521.04s)]
*  I took the people on a big tour of Angkor Wat [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4522.56s)]
*  my second time. What does Angkor Wat? [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4524.280000000001s)]
*  That's the largest temple complex in the world [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4525.4400000000005s)]
*  located in Cambodia. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4527.120000000001s)]
*  Oh wow, okay. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4528.84s)]
*  It's a pyramidal type structure. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4529.92s)]
*  It's got the three rises on it. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4532.200000000001s)]
*  And it looks like poured rock. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4534.68s)]
*  It's massive. It's a megalithic. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4536.04s)]
*  The X-Men mansion is based on this thing. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4537.96s)]
*  Can we bring that up, Mark? [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4541.08s)]
*  And what's it called? [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4542.400000000001s)]
*  Angkor Wat, A-N-G-K-O-R-W-A-T. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4543.240000000001s)]
*  Two words, Angkor, A-N-G-K-O-R, then Wat, W-A-T. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4546.92s)]
*  Now what's interesting about Angkor Wat [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4551.96s)]
*  is the legend of the indigenous people there. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4553.76s)]
*  Yeah, I've seen this. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4556.76s)]
*  It is that it was built in a day and a night. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4557.84s)]
*  But is this like biblical day and night? [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4562.2s)]
*  Like obviously. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4564.08s)]
*  No, no, it's day and night. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4564.92s)]
*  They said the gods built it in a day and a night. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4566.28s)]
*  But that's not only the only account of hearing that. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4569.4800000000005s)]
*  It's been said in many, many different cultures [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4571.68s)]
*  around the world that a lot of these structures [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4574.68s)]
*  were built at a very rapid pace. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4576.320000000001s)]
*  In other words, again, foreknowledge, [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4579.2s)]
*  understanding, construction techniques. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4580.68s)]
*  They have the whole thing ready to go. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4582.4800000000005s)]
*  They understood there's one in the middle there. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4584.0s)]
*  In the middle, down. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4586.92s)]
*  Right here. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4587.76s)]
*  To the right. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4588.6s)]
*  Right, yep, that's it. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4589.8s)]
*  Now look at that moat. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4591.12s)]
*  This moat, which goes around Angkor Wat, [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4592.8s)]
*  I forget how many hectares it is, [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4595.12s)]
*  but it's more mass of mud removed [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4597.04s)]
*  to create that moat around Angkor Wat [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4600.12s)]
*  than the pyramid itself. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4602.24s)]
*  Oh, so the moat isn't natural? [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4603.24s)]
*  No, it's manmade. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4604.68s)]
*  Why? [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4606.4400000000005s)]
*  It's more mass than the Great Pyramid by multitudes. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4607.28s)]
*  Now- [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4611.88s)]
*  Meaning they had to excavate. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4612.72s)]
*  Had to excavate. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4613.96s)]
*  And how did they get the water for it? [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4615.0s)]
*  Did they excavate up until a river or something? [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4617.4400000000005s)]
*  Good question. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4618.56s)]
*  There's mountains, there's a flow of water coming in, [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4619.64s)]
*  there's some water coming from underneath, [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4622.92s)]
*  and also they had to utilize that water for irrigation. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4625.0s)]
*  So you're talking about calculus, [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4628.240000000001s)]
*  you're talking about geology, [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4630.56s)]
*  you're talking about advanced mathematics, [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4632.320000000001s)]
*  you're talking about excavation techniques. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4634.4400000000005s)]
*  There it goes, look at this, look. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4635.84s)]
*  Excavation techniques. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4637.320000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's insane. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4638.360000000001s)]
*  You don't, as a civilization that long ago, [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4639.200000000001s)]
*  say, you know what, let's drain all of our resources [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4641.4800000000005s)]
*  to dig this hole in the ground. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4643.72s)]
*  So there's no way that that was already naturally forming. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4645.0s)]
*  No, they created it from scratch. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4647.68s)]
*  I mean, it's a perfect score. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4649.68s)]
*  That's pretty well- [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4650.52s)]
*  Yeah, they created it from scratch. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4651.36s)]
*  And what's interesting about it is this. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4652.2s)]
*  Holy shit. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4653.64s)]
*  You don't move more mass than the Great Pyramid [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4654.6s)]
*  on a hope and a wish that it's gonna work. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4657.8s)]
*  Think about that for a minute. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4661.76s)]
*  Do you drain your entire civilization's resources [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4663.4s)]
*  to dig out that much mass [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4666.84s)]
*  and hope it's gonna create irrigation and water flow [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4668.76s)]
*  and sustain its height and levels [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4672.32s)]
*  and everything else? [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4675.76s)]
*  I mean, this is more impressive. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4676.6s)]
*  Digging out that much- [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4677.4400000000005s)]
*  Foreknowledge. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4678.84s)]
*  Mud is way more impressive. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4679.76s)]
*  This is foreknowledge. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4682.12s)]
*  You don't do this, you don't start a project like this [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4682.96s)]
*  until you already know it's gonna work. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4684.8s)]
*  But like, how would you even, [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4685.96s)]
*  like I can understand the idea of moving big blocks, right? [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4687.32s)]
*  And even cutting big blocks. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4690.92s)]
*  But digging out a moat of that size with what? [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4693.04s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4699.4400000000005s)]
*  Shovels? [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4700.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4701.16s)]
*  You know, like a block is the size that it is, right? [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4702.36s)]
*  You can maybe carve it out of some sort of like, [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4706.639999999999s)]
*  limestone valley. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4709.28s)]
*  And then let's say you could move it [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4710.839999999999s)]
*  with ancient techniques that are, [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4712.679999999999s)]
*  seem pretty rudimentary to us now, [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4715.2s)]
*  but in reality they were effective. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4718.0s)]
*  Let's say that. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4719.36s)]
*  Moving big things is possible. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4720.2s)]
*  It's possible. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4721.4s)]
*  But to dig out that much, [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4722.24s)]
*  I mean, it would just be hundreds and hundreds [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4724.44s)]
*  of thousands of people with, [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4727.04s)]
*  shut like, a shovel can't even be that big [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4730.6s)]
*  at a certain point in time. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4733.24s)]
*  It's like, what was the 13 feet deep? [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4734.4400000000005s)]
*  13 feet deep, you know? [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4736.12s)]
*  Pretty wild. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4738.4800000000005s)]
*  When you do the math on the side. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4739.320000000001s)]
*  And then how do you maintain the walls? [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4740.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's all. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4741.400000000001s)]
*  Because wouldn't like, [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4742.24s)]
*  it's high thick. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4743.08s)]
*  But you see this happen, I think with rivers, [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4743.92s)]
*  like the reason why rivers have these bends in them, [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4746.88s)]
*  there's a mathematical formula [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4750.12s)]
*  that can predict the bends in a river. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4752.2s)]
*  Correct. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4753.96s)]
*  And the erosion patterns that happen on rivers [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4754.8s)]
*  cause the river water to sway, [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4758.32s)]
*  which further erodes, [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4760.2s)]
*  and then the water comes back in the other direction, [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4761.679999999999s)]
*  which further erodes. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4764.36s)]
*  So you can actually calculate the bends in a river. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4765.2s)]
*  The same thing, I mean, granted, water's not flowing here, [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4768.16s)]
*  but it would flow in. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4771.28s)]
*  You would have erosion of these walls, right? [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4772.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4775.4s)]
*  I mean, that seems pretty. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4776.24s)]
*  Logical. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4777.44s)]
*  That's incredible. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4779.2s)]
*  So are they reinforcing it in some way? [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4780.08s)]
*  It has to be. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4782.84s)]
*  I mean, I have not been able to dive down there [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4783.679999999999s)]
*  and take a look myself. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4786.04s)]
*  That's fucking crazy. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4786.88s)]
*  It has to be a water break of some type [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4788.08s)]
*  that keeps it from, and it's also a pool. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4790.2s)]
*  Is this water stale? [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4793.360000000001s)]
*  No, it's fresh, it's good water. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4795.0s)]
*  But flowing from where? [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4797.240000000001s)]
*  Like eventually a water would go stale. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4799.320000000001s)]
*  It rotates down from the mountains, it flows through, [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4801.6s)]
*  and then even they have these tubes [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4804.52s)]
*  that go out and irrigate fields nearby. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4807.280000000001s)]
*  So they also use it for irrigation. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4810.400000000001s)]
*  This is advanced knowledge. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4811.96s)]
*  And this is how many years ago? [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4813.56s)]
*  Thousands of years ago. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4815.6s)]
*  They try to say that this was built [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4817.0s)]
*  only about maybe 800 years ago [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4819.32s)]
*  by this king who lived to the age of, [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4822.52s)]
*  I think he only lived to the age of 45. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4825.0s)]
*  It would have been impossible for that work to be done [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4827.4s)]
*  with the rudimentary tools that they said he used [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4829.76s)]
*  in a timeframe that he was alive. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4832.08s)]
*  And you look at the glyphs, [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4834.56s)]
*  this thing is littered with hieroglyphs. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4835.64s)]
*  I mean, sophisticated hieroglyphs that are laser etched [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4837.36s)]
*  and every square inch is covered, [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4840.68s)]
*  which means we're talking about something, [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4842.76s)]
*  in my opinion, super ancient. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4844.68s)]
*  This thing could be 20, 30,000 years old. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4847.88s)]
*  I think the king who took the, put his name on it, [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4849.52s)]
*  did what everyone else does. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4852.36s)]
*  Wait, you find some hot shit. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4853.68s)]
*  Cleans it up, it's mine. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4855.12s)]
*  Refurbishes it a little bit. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4858.36s)]
*  This is mine, I built this. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4859.56s)]
*  No, you didn't build it. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4860.64s)]
*  Is there any cool stuff that's in the hieroglyphs or the? [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4861.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, there you go right there, the dinosaur. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4865.52s)]
*  The what? [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4867.28s)]
*  See that dinosaur, that stegosaurus? [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4868.12s)]
*  Right here? [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4869.64s)]
*  No, that's a brontosaurus. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4870.4800000000005s)]
*  On the down left, down left. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4871.32s)]
*  Brontosaurus, on the down left. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4872.36s)]
*  Oh, there's a stegosaurus. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4873.4s)]
*  Stegosaurus, yeah. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4874.24s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4875.08s)]
*  I took a picture right next to that thing. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4876.56s)]
*  There's several of them over there. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4878.16s)]
*  And so what it proves is. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4879.92s)]
*  Oh, no. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4882.04s)]
*  It proves that these people knew what the dinosaurs looked like [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4883.16s)]
*  with the meat on their bones, [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4885.76s)]
*  which is pretty interesting. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4888.0s)]
*  Oh, no. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4889.6s)]
*  So even if they found a skeleton, [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4890.44s)]
*  they might not see all the scales and stuff. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4891.5199999999995s)]
*  And the muscle structure and everything else. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4894.64s)]
*  Yeah, to me, it's the muscle structure [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4897.0s)]
*  that's more impressive than the actual. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4898.56s)]
*  Now, is it possible? [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4902.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4904.28s)]
*  That one's tricky. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4905.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4907.04s)]
*  Did stegosaurus exist in this part of the world? [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4907.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4912.2s)]
*  Like, can we look at Asia and see if there's. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4913.04s)]
*  I've never looked into it. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4916.12s)]
*  I imagine like the landmass that is China now extended [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4917.12s)]
*  into the Asian Pacific. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4923.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's all, you know. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4926.68s)]
*  So it would be possible that there would, [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4927.68s)]
*  these animals would be frequenting these locations [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4930.12s)]
*  millions of years ago. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4932.76s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4934.28s)]
*  Okay, what other cool things that just make no sense? [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4935.12s)]
*  This is where they filmed the Temple of Doom. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4938.5599999999995s)]
*  Got it. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4941.0s)]
*  Yeah, Temple of Doom was filmed there at Ta Prohm, [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4941.84s)]
*  which I went to Ta Prohm. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4944.84s)]
*  But these sites are all really majestic and super ancient. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4947.08s)]
*  But what about other like dinosaur images? [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4951.5599999999995s)]
*  Is there other imagery of anything else? [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4954.28s)]
*  Four more dinosaur images at the temple. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4956.0s)]
*  I don't know if you can. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4958.76s)]
*  What about the top left one, Mark? [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4959.599999999999s)]
*  Right here? [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4961.96s)]
*  Yeah, what is that? [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4962.8s)]
*  There's a long necked creature. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4963.64s)]
*  It could be a camel. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4965.4400000000005s)]
*  Looks like an elephant. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4966.4400000000005s)]
*  That's an elephant. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4967.280000000001s)]
*  That looks like an elephant. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4968.12s)]
*  Yeah, they have a lot of elephants in the. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4968.96s)]
*  Oh, okay, yeah, that makes sense. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4970.320000000001s)]
*  Look at these 3D glyphs though. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4971.52s)]
*  They're pretty elaborate. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4972.64s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4973.8s)]
*  And they're all over the place. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4974.64s)]
*  Imagine covering hundreds of miles with those glyphs [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4975.4800000000005s)]
*  nonstop from the top of the wall, [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4979.68s)]
*  from the bottom of the wall to the top of the wall. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4981.8s)]
*  Okay, let's assume for example, [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4983.12s)]
*  it did happen 800 years ago. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4984.400000000001s)]
*  What other majestic creations did this culture [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4986.4400000000005s)]
*  that was clearly so advanced for the time create? [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4990.360000000001s)]
*  It wouldn't be one thing, right? [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4992.76s)]
*  No. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4994.52s)]
*  It would be many, like you see in Egypt. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4995.360000000001s)]
*  There are many different pyramids. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4996.92s)]
*  There are many different structures. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4998.24s)]
*  So what else is? [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=4999.52s)]
*  There's about 40 incredible temples around that same area. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5001.400000000001s)]
*  Got it, so it's not just this one thing. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5004.320000000001s)]
*  No, it's not just that one thing. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5006.04s)]
*  Literally, I haven't even been to all the temples yet [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5008.0s)]
*  and I've been there twice. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5010.84s)]
*  It takes 38 hours to get there. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5012.16s)]
*  What? [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5014.12s)]
*  Yeah, it takes 38 hours to get there, man. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5014.96s)]
*  Why? It's hard to get there. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5016.2s)]
*  That's how far away it is. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5017.04s)]
*  You gotta fly from, well, I live in Florida, [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5018.360000000001s)]
*  so I gotta fly from Florida to Qatar usually, [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5021.12s)]
*  from Qatar to Bangkok, from Bangkok to Cambodia. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5024.5199999999995s)]
*  Wow. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5030.48s)]
*  It's hard to get there. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5031.32s)]
*  And what was this temple used for in your opinion? [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5032.16s)]
*  Well, you know, that's interesting. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5034.68s)]
*  There's a gigantic pool on the inside of this. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5035.96s)]
*  On the second story, it's a megalithic pool [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5039.16s)]
*  that has to weigh, I don't know how many tens [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5042.599999999999s)]
*  of thousands of tons and it's on the second floor. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5045.16s)]
*  There's another one on the third floor. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5049.16s)]
*  There's a famous picture of me getting blessed by a monk [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5051.96s)]
*  sitting in front of one of those pools. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5054.16s)]
*  The water's not in him. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5056.0199999999995s)]
*  There goes one right there. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5056.86s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5058.4s)]
*  I mean, what's supporting that structure? [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5060.54s)]
*  I mean, how did they know how to build this? [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5063.32s)]
*  And each one of those stones in the basin [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5065.5599999999995s)]
*  are super megalithic, like in Egypt, [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5067.48s)]
*  massive, like super massive. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5069.48s)]
*  If I were standing, you'd get some size comparison [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5071.4s)]
*  to how big those stones are. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5073.599999999999s)]
*  And they're just sitting there, you know? [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5075.5199999999995s)]
*  And there's no collapse. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5077.9s)]
*  After all these thousands of years, there's no collapse. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5079.82s)]
*  And why would there be collapse? [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5083.82s)]
*  Well, if you don't understand how to distribute weight loads, [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5085.379999999999s)]
*  if you don't understand calculus and mass ratios, [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5089.099999999999s)]
*  this would collapse. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5092.78s)]
*  But this is thousands of years [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5093.9s)]
*  and it's still sitting there perfect. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5095.099999999999s)]
*  I bet if you fill it with water, [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5096.42s)]
*  the water wouldn't even leak out of it. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5097.7s)]
*  And you're saying there's one on the second floor [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5100.0199999999995s)]
*  and another on the third floor [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5101.799999999999s)]
*  that actually has water in it? [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5103.7s)]
*  No, there's no water. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5104.98s)]
*  They're both empty, probably because they don't want [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5106.0199999999995s)]
*  the tourists to drown or fall there. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5107.62s)]
*  Does it rain, do you know? [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5109.58s)]
*  Um, it's a rainforest, yeah. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5110.94s)]
*  So it rains all the time. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5112.9s)]
*  So maybe the rainy season would fill it with water. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5113.74s)]
*  Yeah, well they have holes now. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5116.26s)]
*  There's little portholes they have. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5117.82s)]
*  I don't know if you can't see them from this angle. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5120.34s)]
*  No, on this side here. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5122.0199999999995s)]
*  And I think they're used for drainage. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5124.16s)]
*  But yeah, it's incredible, man. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5126.94s)]
*  Wow. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5128.46s)]
*  What an incredible place to visit. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5129.34s)]
*  All right, guys, I'm very excited to tell you [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5130.82s)]
*  about this next company that is sponsoring this podcast today [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5132.22s)]

*  that I need in my life now, [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5137.18s)]

*  It is that simple. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5145.5s)]
*  Gum and mints that actually help give you [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5146.58s)]
*  the energy you need and then help you sleep [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5148.4800000000005s)]
*  depending on which you choose, all right? [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5151.740000000001s)]
*  First we have the energy and focus. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5154.38s)]
*  It's got the B6, it's got natural caffeine, [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5156.22s)]
*  and the L-theanine or whatever the hell you pronounce it. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5158.66s)]
*  It doesn't matter to you. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5162.1s)]
*  What matters is it's gonna keep you up and focused, okay? [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5163.42s)]
*  It's been clinically proven and shown [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5165.92s)]
*  to improve short-term sustained attention [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5168.64s)]

*  They have two delicious flavors, cinnamon and peppermint, [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5172.4800000000005s)]
*  and it's the quickest, most portable way to get some energy. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5174.88s)]
*  If you don't have time to run and get a coffee, [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5177.32s)]
*  you know, you could just pop a piece of gum or a mint. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5179.56s)]
*  You just keep it moving. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5182.4800000000005s)]

*  all these different time zones, different situations, [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5201.2s)]
*  not going to bed, you don't even love the bed, [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5203.92s)]
*  you're gonna be sleeping in. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5206.08s)]
*  How do we make sure that we get a good night's sleep? [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5207.96s)]

*  All right guys, let's take a break for a second. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5277.56s)]
*  Mother's Day is coming up, we need to do [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5279.52s)]
*  something thoughtful, okay? [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5280.84s)]
*  This is actually a fantastic idea. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5284.0s)]
*  The Skylight Calendar is a smart touchscreen calendar [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5285.52s)]

*  It's a great, thoughtful gift, [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5292.0s)]

*  why I think it's really awesome. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5296.8s)]
*  You can program and load up whatever pictures [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5298.780000000001s)]
*  you want into the Skylight Frame, okay? [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5302.04s)]

*  all of your appointments and groceries [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5307.8s)]

*  You and your mom when you're kids, [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5317.54s)]
*  your mom taking care of your brother, your sister, [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5318.8s)]

*  And now you're giving your mom not just a new picture [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5323.76s)]
*  on let's say her birthday, let's say Mother's Day, [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5326.8s)]
*  but whenever you want, you're sending her that reminder [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5330.92s)]

*  Look at this, two birds with one stone. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5339.08s)]
*  Your mom feels good and thinks about you, [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5341.36s)]
*  and you don't have to do anything. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5343.24s)]

*  that your old ass mom probably doesn't even know how to use, [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5355.26s)]

*  They spell out how the universe looks mathematically. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5438.660000000001s)]
*  The universe itself is a sphere, [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5442.22s)]
*  and we're living in a fractal of that. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5443.46s)]
*  Oh yeah, I wanna get into that. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5445.3s)]
*  One last question about the pyramids. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5447.94s)]
*  What is the purpose of the pyramids of Giza? [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5449.74s)]
*  Oh yes. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5451.58s)]
*  Okay, yeah, so the Great Pyramid [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5452.42s)]
*  is a power generation system, or was. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5453.74s)]
*  When the energy shot out of the apex, [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5456.58s)]
*  the magnetized crystal granite obelisk [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5458.76s)]
*  would capture that ambient energy, [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5462.9s)]
*  and if you had something called a jet, [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5464.86s)]
*  you can connect that jet with a wire, [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5466.78s)]
*  which we have pictures of the hieroglyphs of them doing this [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5468.5599999999995s)]
*  to light bulbs and electroplating devices [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5470.66s)]
*  and everything else, and you can power tools. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5472.48s)]
*  So you had power tools, power lighting, [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5475.0s)]
*  and capability through ambient energy, [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5477.9400000000005s)]
*  the same technique that Nikola Tesla used [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5479.38s)]
*  to build the Wardenclyffe Tower that was eventually, [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5481.5s)]
*  he lost the funding from J.P. Morgan. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5484.46s)]
*  And then the Bent Pyramid is not bent [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5487.02s)]
*  because it was an accident, they got the angle wrong. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5490.26s)]
*  That's baloney. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5492.74s)]
*  The Bent Pyramid was told to me by one of my mentors, [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5493.9800000000005s)]
*  who was a homegrown Egyptologist that passed away [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5496.62s)]
*  a couple years ago, unfortunately, bless his soul. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5498.820000000001s)]
*  It's a diagnostics tool. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5501.42s)]
*  And so inside the Bent Pyramid, [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5503.42s)]
*  which I've climbed all the way to the apex from the inside, [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5505.38s)]
*  have you been to the inside going all the way to the top? [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5508.54s)]
*  I haven't visited the Bent Pyramid, [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5510.7s)]
*  I've only been to Giza. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5511.900000000001s)]
*  When you get into the top and you look over, [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5512.900000000001s)]
*  you get to see down to this other, [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5515.74s)]
*  I guess you wanna call it a room, [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5518.9800000000005s)]
*  and in that area, he said, if somebody was sick or injured, [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5520.9400000000005s)]
*  they would be brought into this one chamber, [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5524.14s)]
*  which I've climbed into, I took 140 people in groups. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5525.900000000001s)]
*  It would be, there's another area would be full of water, [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5529.76s)]
*  and then they would gong this stone, [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5531.9400000000005s)]
*  and it would create this resonance [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5533.900000000001s)]
*  that would vibrate throughout all the different other [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5535.14s)]
*  chambers, and the person at top, [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5537.14s)]
*  they call him the priest, he would look over, [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5539.14s)]
*  and it would see almost like an X-ray of the person's body. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5541.04s)]
*  I know it sounds fanciful, but that's what was said. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5543.9800000000005s)]
*  If you look at the Bent Pyramid and you look at the pyramid [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5547.46s)]
*  of the sun side by side, it's the same exact structure. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5550.5s)]
*  The Bent Pyramid and the pyramid of the sun. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5554.62s)]
*  Pyramid of the sun in Teotihuacan, Mexico. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5556.42s)]
*  God, I've gotta, gotta, gotta. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5559.34s)]
*  Very similar shape. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5560.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5562.9800000000005s)]
*  So the shape isn't an accident. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5563.820000000001s)]
*  It's not the exact same, but I hear what you're saying. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5565.38s)]
*  The angle, the change of the angle, [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5566.94s)]
*  the look, the feel of it, you kinda get the idea. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5568.74s)]
*  Now the argument for the one in Teotihuacan [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5572.34s)]
*  is they're gonna say that this would create [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5574.5s)]
*  the most structural integrity. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5576.54s)]
*  Whereas the Bent Pyramid, I think that they say [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5578.66s)]
*  that they were using like mud blocks, right? [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5580.5s)]
*  And didn't the... [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5584.0199999999995s)]
*  Those stones are limestone, and this thing is... [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5585.5s)]
*  The Bent Pyramid? [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5588.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5589.62s)]
*  My understanding is that it was kind of collapsing [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5590.46s)]
*  under its own weight or something like that. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5591.74s)]
*  No, no. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5592.66s)]
*  Doing a whole show on this. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5594.66s)]
*  I believe, yeah. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5595.94s)]
*  The Bent Pyramid, you see those areas on the corner [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5597.259999999999s)]
*  that are dark and all kinda chewed up? [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5599.66s)]
*  When you go up right on them, [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5602.099999999999s)]
*  you notice that they're actually burnt. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5603.5s)]
*  They're charred. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5605.54s)]
*  And then there's a debris field coming off of the corner [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5606.36s)]
*  down into where the sand is, and I have some of the samples [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5609.5s)]
*  that we had looked at, those samples of charred stone, [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5613.219999999999s)]
*  burnt stone. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5617.94s)]
*  And what's gonna burn and char the stone [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5619.54s)]
*  and create these explosions? [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5621.46s)]
*  There's another area on the other side [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5622.74s)]
*  where a huge piece of it's been blown off. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5624.3s)]
*  You can see that it's hit and it's blown out, [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5626.42s)]
*  not collapsing. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5630.0599999999995s)]
*  And so what would make that amount of debris fly [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5631.42s)]
*  that far away from the pyramid? [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5634.38s)]
*  If something collapses, it falls straight down. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5637.139999999999s)]
*  This stuff goes up and out. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5639.78s)]
*  And you can kinda calculate the trajectory. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5642.179999999999s)]
*  You go, oh man, something impacted this. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5644.0199999999995s)]
*  A projectile impacted this pyramid. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5646.38s)]
*  So it's another remnant of the ancient war, [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5650.06s)]
*  in my opinion, that same war that I told you about earlier. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5653.26s)]
*  But the pyramid is like that by design. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5656.38s)]
*  So you're saying that these pyramids were power systems? [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5659.46s)]
*  Not all of them. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5663.46s)]
*  This one was supposed to be, according to my source, [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5664.280000000001s)]
*  a diagnostics tool. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5668.34s)]
*  But the Great Pyramid of Giza was a power system? [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5669.780000000001s)]
*  Power plant, yes. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5674.780000000001s)]
*  I've heard this before. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5675.620000000001s)]
*  And there's been books written about this by engineers. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5676.4400000000005s)]
*  And how would it function as a power plant? [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5678.78s)]
*  Well, it functions well, like I said, [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5681.3s)]
*  running water underneath granite [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5683.02s)]
*  creates physio-static electricity. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5684.7s)]
*  In the area that you walked up, that grand gallery, [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5686.78s)]
*  there's these slots on the side. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5689.54s)]
*  We estimate, or we hypothesize, I'm sorry, [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5692.74s)]
*  that there were rods in those sections. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5695.38s)]
*  They call them resonating rods. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5698.78s)]
*  And that would step up the energy [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5700.62s)]
*  going into the king's chamber. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5701.94s)]
*  And then from there, there was some type of fusion [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5704.02s)]
*  that would happen. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5705.78s)]
*  So you can see that the stone box inside the king's chamber [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5706.62s)]
*  has a big chunk missing off of it. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5709.42s)]
*  And if you look across directly to the wall, [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5711.7s)]
*  20 feet away, you can see where that chunk that flew up [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5714.0599999999995s)]
*  impacted the wall and created the shape of that broken piece. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5716.86s)]
*  How can you break rose granite and send it that distance [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5719.96s)]
*  and crash into another piece of granite [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5724.58s)]
*  and have it break into that piece? [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5726.14s)]
*  So we know that there was an explosion in there. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5727.88s)]
*  Okay? Yeah. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5730.38s)]
*  So evidence of an explosion. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5731.28s)]
*  It's a power generator. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5732.66s)]
*  Now the queen, what I was talking about earlier, [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5733.5s)]
*  the queen's chamber, water would flow into that. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5735.5s)]
*  And Christopher Dunn, when I interviewed him the other day, [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5738.78s)]
*  after all these years of me talking about this, [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5740.82s)]
*  I had no idea he had the same hypothesis. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5742.58s)]
*  This guy is a real engineer. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5744.34s)]
*  The water would go down there and through electrolysis, [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5747.22s)]
*  they would extract hydrogen atoms from the water. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5750.42s)]
*  Okay. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5753.14s)]
*  So if you take a battery, like a nine volt battery, [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5753.98s)]
*  put it in a glass of water, you'll start seeing bubbles. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5756.3s)]
*  Okay. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5758.82s)]
*  That's the hydrogen coming out of the water. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5759.64s)]
*  Okay. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5761.54s)]
*  You're extracting, it's that easy to do. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5762.38s)]
*  It's not hard. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5763.78s)]
*  I'm trying to make the point, [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5764.6s)]
*  like it's not like real science, it's simple. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5765.4400000000005s)]
*  You just need to understand positive and negative volts. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5768.400000000001s)]
*  Anyway, so, but why hydrogen? [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5771.700000000001s)]
*  The shafts of the pyramid, those open shafts, [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5774.8s)]
*  they align with star systems. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5777.900000000001s)]
*  They align with Orion, Aldebaran, Sirius star system, right? [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5779.84s)]
*  All these different star systems on different alignments, [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5783.0s)]
*  on different perception of the equinoxes. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5785.04s)]
*  What communication method do we use right now, [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5788.5s)]
*  like at SETI and in modern technology astrophysics [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5791.620000000001s)]
*  to try to communicate with ET? [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5794.12s)]
*  We transmit information on the hydrogen frequency [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5796.0s)]
*  because it's the most abundant frequency in the universe. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5799.76s)]
*  So in my opinion, this is my own hypothesis now, [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5803.2s)]
*  see I always tell you the difference [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5805.64s)]
*  between text and my hypothesis. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5806.48s)]
*  On those alignments, we would transmit information [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5808.94s)]
*  to those star system updates [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5812.44s)]
*  on our breakaway civilization, to our other people. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5813.68s)]
*  So they were not using it as a power system to- [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5816.44s)]
*  They use it as both. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5819.48s)]
*  It's a multifunctional stone computer and a power generator. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5820.4s)]
*  So it's a power generator for Egypt, [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5823.2s)]
*  to whatever they were doing. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5827.28s)]
*  And then it's also a communication device [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5829.5599999999995s)]
*  for other galaxies. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5831.5599999999995s)]
*  Correct, that's my personal opinion. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5833.0s)]
*  Other star systems, not galaxies. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5834.28s)]
*  Sorry, other star systems. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5836.5599999999995s)]
*  Isn't a galaxy a star system? [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5838.24s)]
*  Well, our Milky Way galaxy has trillions [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5839.96s)]
*  of star systems inside of it. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5842.44s)]
*  Oh, got it. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5844.96s)]
*  And there's trillions of- [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5846.5199999999995s)]
*  Got it, the galaxy has the star systems, [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5847.36s)]
*  each star system, we are within one star system. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5849.24s)]
*  Got it, got it, got it. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5852.2s)]
*  What about the Ark of the Covenant related to this? [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5853.04s)]
*  Well, when the Great Pyramid, for some reason, [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5854.76s)]
*  stopped producing enough power, [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5857.12s)]
*  they took the Ark of the Covenant [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5858.64s)]
*  and they created that rose granite box [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5859.84s)]
*  inside the King's Chamber and they put it inside of there. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5862.2s)]
*  What is the Ark of the Covenant? [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5864.68s)]
*  It's a power generating technology. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5866.36s)]
*  How do we know this? [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5868.2s)]
*  Because- [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5869.44s)]
*  What do people think it is? [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5870.28s)]
*  I've heard the Ark of the Covenant. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5871.5199999999995s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5872.64s)]
*  I think it's this holy thing that existed [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5873.48s)]
*  that just protected the Hebrews [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5874.72s)]
*  and protected them from the Pharaoh. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5877.08s)]
*  It's a lot more than that. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5879.48s)]
*  When you begin to read even the biblical text, [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5880.36s)]
*  you discover it was technology. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5882.36s)]
*  The person that handled it had to have on rubber boots, [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5884.16s)]
*  right, it's electric. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5888.28s)]
*  You had to have on special rubber gloves, [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5890.12s)]
*  you had to have on these breastplates [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5891.92s)]
*  to help defract some of the radiation [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5894.0s)]
*  that was coming out of it. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5896.48s)]
*  And if you didn't have that stuff on [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5897.679999999999s)]
*  and you touched it, you die instantly. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5898.5199999999995s)]
*  People thought it was holy and magical. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5900.16s)]
*  No, it's just technology. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5901.5199999999995s)]
*  You're getting shocked to death. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5902.88s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5905.08s)]
*  Now, the descriptions of this thing, [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5905.96s)]
*  sending out lightning bolts and all this stuff [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5908.36s)]
*  and vibrations and buzzes, it's electrical. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5911.12s)]
*  So some scientists at a university in America [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5913.96s)]
*  reproduced it utilizing the same instructions [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5918.24s)]
*  in the biblical text. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5921.599999999999s)]
*  Reproduced what? [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5922.44s)]
*  The Ark of the Covenant. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5923.44s)]
*  And guess what? [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5925.0s)]
*  It generated so much power they had to shut it down. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5925.92s)]
*  And anyone can Google that, look up the experiment [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5928.36s)]
*  and watch the videos on YouTube of them doing it. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5930.04s)]
*  It's real. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5933.0s)]
*  It was technology. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5934.04s)]
*  And that's what was inside of the stone box. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5935.68s)]
*  How do I know? [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5938.12s)]
*  It's the same exact dimension as the Ark of the Covenant. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5939.24s)]
*  And that's what happened when Moses, [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5941.599999999999s)]
*  AKA probably Akhenaten, I think it was really the person, [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5943.5599999999995s)]
*  fled Egypt. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5947.48s)]
*  It wasn't slaves building the pyramids, by the way. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5950.12s)]
*  Take the slave thing out of your mind. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5952.44s)]
*  It was no slaves building pyramids. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5953.8s)]
*  Didn't happen. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5955.16s)]
*  People were building and working on the pyramids [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5956.24s)]
*  because they were honoring the gods. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5958.0s)]
*  There were no Hebrew slaves in Egypt building pyramids. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5959.599999999999s)]
*  Nowhere does it even say that. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5962.2s)]
*  There's records of the payroll [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5964.44s)]
*  and even the medical expenses to help people out [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5966.76s)]
*  who got injured or hurt at the job site, at the temples. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5969.400000000001s)]
*  And that stuff is in the museum. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5972.76s)]
*  It's all documented. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5973.92s)]
*  So it's not just me saying that. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5974.76s)]
*  But Akhenaten started bringing in the one God religion, [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5976.4400000000005s)]
*  the monotheistic religion. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5981.24s)]
*  He's the first one to bring that in. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5983.0s)]
*  We're gonna worship the great Amen, Amen-Ra. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5984.72s)]
*  He started telling his people to go around [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5989.6s)]
*  and deface all the other gods, [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5991.400000000001s)]
*  erase them from history, chisel them all away. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5992.76s)]
*  That's when you go to Egypt, [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5995.16s)]
*  you see all those chiseled faces away. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5996.0s)]
*  All the noses broken off and all that. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5997.84s)]
*  It's not because, I hate to say it, but it's a fact. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=5999.24s)]
*  It's not because white people didn't wanna know, [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6002.24s)]
*  let us know that black people were in Egypt. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6004.64s)]
*  That's not true. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6007.56s)]
*  I'm gonna tell you what it is. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6009.0s)]
*  It's not true. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6010.72s)]
*  I've been there long enough to know, [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6011.56s)]
*  and I know enough history to know [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6013.28s)]
*  when the white people actually arrived there, [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6014.44s)]
*  these things were broken before. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6016.84s)]
*  They even got there. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6018.68s)]
*  They even got there. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6019.52s)]
*  So there's enough noses that still exist, by the way, [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6020.84s)]
*  that are on display that tell you, [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6024.16s)]
*  well, wait a minute, if these are just as old [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6025.68s)]
*  and these still have noses, then these never got beat up. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6027.16s)]
*  But anyway, the point is, he then took these people [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6030.2s)]
*  and created his own following, his own cult following. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6034.32s)]
*  They all wanted to worship one God. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6037.08s)]
*  And Amen said, there'll be no other God but me [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6039.28s)]
*  because I'm a jealous God that made it into the Bible. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6041.36s)]
*  And he then decides to take his people, [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6044.64s)]
*  because now the politics are like, [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6048.88s)]
*  we gotta get this guy out of here. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6050.92s)]
*  He's destroying our history. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6051.8s)]
*  He says, okay, I'll leave. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6053.2s)]
*  I'm taking my people with me. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6054.12s)]
*  He goes into the Great Pyramid [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6055.5599999999995s)]
*  and takes the Ark of the Covenant with him [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6056.8s)]
*  and takes that out into the desert. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6059.16s)]
*  This is why he had to chase him down. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6060.68s)]
*  He just lifted up and take it out. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6062.8s)]
*  Knowing you have the boots on, [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6063.92s)]
*  I mean, it's clear instructions on how to do it. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6064.76s)]
*  Oh, I thought it was like enclosed. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6066.72s)]
*  No, no, it's not enclosed. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6068.24s)]
*  It's just like a lift up thing with two handles on each side. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6069.16s)]
*  They took it out of the King's Chamber. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6072.08s)]
*  The new Pharaoh said, man, that's our power source. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6074.12s)]
*  So it was justified to chase him. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6077.2s)]
*  Yeah, like if he takes that, we lose all, [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6078.84s)]
*  we're going back into the Stone Ages. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6081.12s)]
*  That's the power source. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6083.400000000001s)]
*  We gotta get this guy now. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6084.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6086.0s)]
*  That's what it was all about, the power source. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6086.84s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6089.24s)]
*  But he ended up getting away with it. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6090.08s)]
*  He got away with it. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6091.6s)]
*  With that one, there were a few more. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6093.16s)]
*  There were two more Ark of the Covenant, [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6094.360000000001s)]
*  but they didn't have one. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6096.52s)]
*  Who had them? [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6097.6s)]
*  Well, there was one in China and one in Mesoamerica. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6098.88s)]
*  What did they make with it in China? [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6102.2s)]
*  Nobody knows. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6104.16s)]
*  You know, they got three pyramids in China [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6105.56s)]
*  that match the same Orion alignment [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6106.96s)]
*  as the Great Pyramids and alignment [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6109.0s)]
*  that we have at Giza on the Giza Plateau. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6111.16s)]
*  Can you bring that up? [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6112.88s)]
*  Yeah, bring up the China Pyramids aligned with Orion. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6113.72s)]
*  So who were the group of people that built the pyramids? [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6115.84s)]
*  These were the Atlantean people. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6118.72s)]
*  They had humans working on the pyramids, [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6121.5599999999995s)]
*  because I mean, you know, if I own a construction company [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6123.5599999999995s)]
*  and then I have a master architect, [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6126.16s)]
*  underneath then I have a foreman, [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6128.72s)]
*  underneath them then I have the workers. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6129.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6132.76s)]
*  So yeah, so that's how it is. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6133.599999999999s)]
*  So the workers are doing work under the tutelage [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6134.5199999999995s)]
*  and utilizing tools in a way that we have taught them, [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6136.8s)]
*  but at the end of the day, [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6140.32s)]
*  it's the master blueprint coming from one master architect. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6143.28s)]
*  There you go, China's on the left right there. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6146.96s)]
*  The Xi'an Pyramids. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6149.679999999999s)]
*  They're called the what? [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6151.44s)]
*  The Xi'an, X-I-A-N. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6152.4s)]
*  You see those three? [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6154.719999999999s)]
*  They're perfectly aligned with Orion. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6155.5599999999995s)]
*  Next one is the Teotihuacan, [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6158.16s)]
*  perfectly aligned with Orion, [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6160.0s)]
*  and the third one obviously is the pyramid is Egypt, [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6161.28s)]
*  perfectly aligned with Orion as well. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6163.88s)]
*  So master architect. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6166.0s)]
*  Now, [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6168.08s)]
*  a traditional mainstream scientist would look at this [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6169.879999999999s)]
*  and go, of course we're gonna align these structures [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6174.4s)]
*  with the three brightest stars in the galaxy, right? [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6176.919999999999s)]
*  And if there was nothing to read back then, [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6181.32s)]
*  there was nothing to watch, [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6184.08s)]
*  there's no TikTok, there's no Instagram, [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6185.16s)]
*  the coolest thing going on is the night sky. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6187.48s)]
*  And when you look up in the night sky, [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6190.24s)]
*  you start making shit out, [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6191.639999999999s)]
*  that's right, this is a whale, [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6192.919999999999s)]
*  this is a giraffe, whatever it is. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6195.52s)]
*  Okay, so that's what the traditional mainstream [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6198.160000000001s)]
*  philosopher or scientist would say. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6200.080000000001s)]
*  Can we see the just pictures of the pyramids not aligned, [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6202.56s)]
*  just like face on? [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6205.8s)]
*  I never knew that there are these pyramids in China. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6206.92s)]
*  It's hard to get- [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6208.76s)]
*  Access to them? [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6210.080000000001s)]
*  It's hard to get access to the face on, [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6210.92s)]
*  because China doesn't want them out. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6212.64s)]
*  They don't even let people visit them. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6214.64s)]
*  There's one- What is that? [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6215.92s)]
*  They're keeping them sacred. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6217.96s)]
*  You see, there goes one there. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6220.240000000001s)]
*  They've got it nicely covered with some nice trees. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6221.56s)]
*  Yeah, did they plant these trees? [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6225.16s)]
*  It looks like they planted- [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6226.12s)]
*  They planted them, yeah. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6226.96s)]
*  They covered them with dirt [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6228.36s)]
*  and planted trees on top of them. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6229.24s)]
*  And why do they want to plant, [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6230.32s)]
*  why do they want to cover this? [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6232.44s)]
*  What benefit would that be? [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6233.76s)]
*  They just don't want people to know that- [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6235.0s)]
*  There's an advanced civilization. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6237.08s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6238.92s)]
*  The more cover up, more- [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6240.0s)]
*  The Chinese pyramids and the Pole Star. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6241.2s)]
*  Is that, that's not beneath the pyramids, is it? [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6245.36s)]
*  No, that's a different area right there. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6248.5599999999995s)]
*  He's looking at the- [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6250.12s)]
*  So the terracotta warriors? [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6250.96s)]
*  Yeah, the terracotta warriors. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6252.32s)]
*  Yeah, that's totally different. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6253.759999999999s)]
*  But yeah, wow. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6254.759999999999s)]
*  A lot of incredible stuff there in China. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6256.759999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6259.36s)]
*  Yeah, they got the pyramids too. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6260.32s)]
*  Now, the alignment is extremely hard to do. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6262.12s)]
*  So that alignment happens on a processional period. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6265.599999999999s)]
*  So you're talking about a massive span of time. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6269.5199999999995s)]
*  You're talking about, it has to align every, [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6271.599999999999s)]
*  well, depending on the procession, [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6276.0s)]
*  every 13, 14,000 years, right? [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6277.84s)]
*  So all of a sudden, you look at the younger Dryas era [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6280.12s)]
*  where we had a mass extinction level event [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6285.28s)]
*  happen right above Syria [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6287.32s)]
*  and it decimated that whole region and down even into Asia. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6289.08s)]
*  Not the perfect time to be building a pyramid complex. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6292.64s)]
*  So you gotta go back another processional period [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6295.5199999999995s)]
*  to get the right alignment, to make sure it works. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6297.44s)]
*  And you have to build it to that where it aligns [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6299.88s)]
*  with these stars show up right over the pyramids [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6301.72s)]
*  at a specific time. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6303.44s)]
*  So now we're going back 36,000 years, [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6305.0s)]
*  the same age as the Great Period, [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6307.08s)]
*  the same age as the Emerald tablets of Thoth. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6308.4s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6310.32s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6312.0s)]
*  Can you tell us about the, not Gobek-Goblek-Tetapi, [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6313.08s)]
*  but there's another ancient structure right near there [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6315.88s)]
*  that you had talked about. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6319.5599999999995s)]
*  Deron Kuyu? [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6320.639999999999s)]
*  I think so. Yeah. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6321.5599999999995s)]
*  Deron Kuyu is an amazing underground city. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6322.5599999999995s)]
*  There's a bunch of them. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6326.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's a bunch of them, correct. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6326.88s)]
*  And this one was discovered by a farmer. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6328.5599999999995s)]
*  And when they opened it up and went down there, [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6330.799999999999s)]
*  it can hold up to 30,000 people [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6333.08s)]
*  going down 12 stories deep into the ground. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6336.0s)]
*  To the water level. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6338.68s)]
*  Yes. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6339.72s)]
*  And even areas for worshiping and cattle. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6340.56s)]
*  Livestock, yeah. Livestock and all of that. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6343.56s)]
*  No sign of any collapse. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6345.52s)]
*  14,000 ventilation shafts leading to the highest levels [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6347.56s)]
*  to bring oxygen to the people at the deepest level. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6351.88s)]
*  And what is your hypothesis? [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6354.52s)]
*  That's advanced technology, [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6355.96s)]
*  because when you have a ventilation shaft this wide, [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6357.0s)]
*  an inch or two wide, [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6359.68s)]
*  going cutting through solid stone down 12 stories, [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6361.4s)]
*  what kind of tool can do that? [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6366.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's interesting. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6368.2s)]
*  How do you do that? [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6369.5199999999995s)]
*  Why would they build it though? [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6370.36s)]
*  Why would they want to live underground? [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6371.18s)]
*  Good question. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6372.36s)]
*  All the cultures around the world, [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6373.44s)]
*  all the indigenous cultures have the same story. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6375.32s)]
*  At some point there was a disaster, [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6377.5199999999995s)]
*  either it's not known if it was war or geological, [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6379.44s)]
*  it's not known. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6383.16s)]
*  So geological would be comets or something like that. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6384.08s)]
*  And war would obviously just be neighboring tribe. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6386.32s)]
*  Right. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6388.88s)]
*  So these people called the Ant people [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6389.8s)]
*  took them underground. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6392.76s)]
*  Lakota tribe, the Hopi tribe, the Aboriginals, [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6393.84s)]
*  the people of Egypt also. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6397.56s)]
*  And in the go to the Cairo museum, [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6400.2s)]
*  you see the Ant people depicted there. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6401.92s)]
*  They took them to underground chambers. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6403.56s)]
*  And then of course the people in Turkey, same story. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6405.68s)]
*  They were taken underground. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6407.92s)]
*  This structure was built to keep them alive, [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6409.84s)]
*  not by them, by the gods. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6411.96s)]
*  Pretty interesting. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6415.4800000000005s)]
*  And why would the gods just stop whatever was going on? [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6416.36s)]
*  Well, we're talking about some people with big egos. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6420.639999999999s)]
*  It was always, I'm the best, I'm better than you, [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6424.32s)]
*  I got the most resources. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6428.28s)]
*  At one point, how the war happened, [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6430.08s)]
*  when they came to this planet, [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6432.92s)]
*  they were forbidden to touch the WMDs, [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6434.44s)]
*  the weapons of mass destruction. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6438.36s)]
*  This is what's on the tablet, weapons of mass destruction. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6441.0s)]
*  They stole some from Nibiru and brought them here [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6444.08s)]
*  and hid them in a mountain. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6447.36s)]
*  But they were then said, [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6448.92s)]
*  they swore that they would never use them. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6449.76s)]
*  But then of course, some of the relatives [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6451.76s)]
*  discovered them years later [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6454.04s)]
*  and decided to go get those weapons and use them, [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6456.24s)]
*  which created the evil wind on earth, [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6459.0s)]
*  which started killing a lot of people. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6460.64s)]
*  And then that's when they said, [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6463.0s)]
*  well, Enki went to his father Anu and said, [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6464.64s)]
*  can you stop the evil wind? [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6466.68s)]
*  And he goes, no, I can't. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6468.5199999999995s)]
*  So get in your sky ship and forebow. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6469.68s)]
*  That means get the hell out of here. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6471.44s)]
*  Is there a part of you that's like, [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6474.8s)]
*  so much of this isn't proven? [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6477.76s)]
*  Is there a part of you that goes, [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6480.28s)]
*  man, one day I might, well, one day, [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6481.96s)]
*  we're all gonna pass [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6485.28s)]
*  and you might not know what really happened, [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6486.76s)]
*  what's really going on in the world? [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6489.36s)]
*  And does that frustrate you? [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6490.92s)]
*  Have you accepted that these things [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6492.44s)]
*  just can't be proven? [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6494.08s)]
*  I see it like this. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6497.32s)]
*  I'm planting seeds for trees that are gonna grow [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6498.76s)]
*  that I'll never sit in the shade of. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6501.16s)]
*  And you're okay with that? [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6503.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm okay with that. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6504.320000000001s)]
*  I've done my part. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6505.52s)]
*  And the grand scale of things in this incarnation, [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6506.4800000000005s)]
*  I feel like I've done my part. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6509.64s)]
*  Do you ever wish that you would get a sign [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6510.8s)]
*  from these advanced beings, [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6512.72s)]
*  from these cultures that exist [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6514.8s)]
*  in different galaxies or solar systems? [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6516.320000000001s)]
*  In 1977, when we moved to Miami and Opel Oco, [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6518.040000000001s)]
*  we lived next to the Opel Oco airport. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6521.080000000001s)]
*  I was outside in my backyard. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6523.4400000000005s)]
*  This is how I got into all this. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6524.64s)]
*  I was watching the planes go over my house in the backyard [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6525.92s)]
*  because it always intrigued me. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6528.64s)]
*  How can the plane be going so slow, [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6529.96s)]
*  but I know it's gotta be going fast to stay in the air? [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6532.24s)]
*  Then this day, this thing came across [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6534.92s)]
*  and cleared the horizon in seconds, not minutes. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6536.92s)]
*  And it was a glowing, not a full-size cigar, [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6539.76s)]
*  not really an egg, but kinda in between metal, [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6542.44s)]
*  glowing metal. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6545.16s)]
*  And it went across and then it stopped. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6546.28s)]
*  And it came back and hovered above me [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6548.08s)]
*  and was gone again. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6550.48s)]
*  I went running in the house and told my mom, [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6552.599999999999s)]
*  oh my God, I can't believe what I just saw. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6554.04s)]
*  It didn't have a wing, fuselage, none of that stuff. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6556.32s)]
*  I knew what an airplane looked like as a kid. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6559.0s)]
*  And I went to my library the next day [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6561.28s)]
*  at my elementary school, Rainbow Park Elementary [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6563.12s)]
*  in Opel Oco, which is still there. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6565.32s)]
*  And I told my teacher, I have to get the encyclopedia, [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6566.96s)]
*  the old Google. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6569.12s)]
*  And I went and got all the aerospace information [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6570.2s)]
*  and started researching swept wing, delta wing, [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6572.48s)]
*  intercontinental ballistic, ballistic, [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6574.92s)]
*  all the different types of submarines. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6577.16s)]
*  I looked for anything that I could see [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6578.48s)]
*  to what I saw in the sky and never found it. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6580.48s)]
*  But that's what led me down this whole rabbit hole, [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6582.76s)]
*  the discovery. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6584.48s)]
*  I became a kind of a quasi aerospace historian. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6585.32s)]
*  And that led me, eventually technology led me [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6587.5599999999995s)]
*  into ancient civilizations. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6589.44s)]
*  So you think you saw an alien spaceship? [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6592.08s)]
*  Yeah, because back then I don't believe we had the technology [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6593.599999999999s)]
*  to create a ARV, an alien production vehicle. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6595.92s)]
*  I think what I saw was probably a real UFO. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6598.88s)]
*  Wow, are you the first black guy to see a UFO? [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6602.12s)]
*  I'm not the first black guy. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6605.12s)]
*  I'm just one of the first, you know, [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6606.4s)]
*  I'm not one of the first [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6608.28s)]
*  because I know there was Benny and Barney Hill. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6609.24s)]
*  Barney Hill was a black guy who came out, [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6613.4s)]
*  I think it was in the 60s or 70s, [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6615.36s)]
*  about his abduction situation with him and his wife. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6618.4s)]
*  And him and his wife were abducted [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6622.24s)]
*  and they gave an account of what these beings showed them [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6623.759999999999s)]
*  as where they came from. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6626.96s)]
*  And nobody knew where the Zeta Reticulous Star System [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6628.5199999999995s)]
*  was at that time, didn't exist in our star maps. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6630.679999999999s)]
*  Later on, it came out, a person says, wait a minute. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6633.839999999999s)]
*  And they put it together and said, [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6637.08s)]
*  this is Zeta Reticulous, we found this star system now. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6639.599999999999s)]
*  Now we know where they're say they were from. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6642.839999999999s)]
*  Pretty interesting. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6645.16s)]
*  Wait, hold on. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6646.08s)]
*  So this couple described a star system [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6647.68s)]
*  that they could have no prior knowledge of. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6652.2s)]
*  Correct. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6654.8s)]
*  Meaning they couldn't have gone to school [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6655.64s)]
*  and learned about this or read about this anywhere. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6657.24s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6659.68s)]
*  Later on, we find this star system. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6660.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6663.52s)]
*  And then who connects the dots? [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6664.36s)]
*  An astrophysicist or astronomer connects the dots [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6666.56s)]
*  and says, wait a minute, this is Zeta Reticulous. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6669.4400000000005s)]
*  Okay, so you see this thing. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6673.52s)]
*  And again, we don't know. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6675.12s)]
*  It could be advanced technology that we have, [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6676.2s)]
*  that you saw. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6678.88s)]
*  Science is full of uncertainty, [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6681.08s)]
*  which I learned from Professor James Gates yesterday [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6682.8s)]
*  when I talked to him about supersymmetry and stuff [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6685.28s)]
*  in an interview I did with him just yesterday. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6689.0s)]
*  And that uncertainty is always there. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6691.24s)]
*  You can never say anything for 100% certainty. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6693.16s)]
*  And so because of that, [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6696.28s)]
*  there is always a possibility that it's something else. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6697.5199999999995s)]
*  I had dinner with Bob Lazar. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6700.5199999999995s)]
*  Okay. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6702.28s)]
*  And my takeaway from the dinner with Bob, [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6703.56s)]
*  Bob was going on Rogan, [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6707.6s)]
*  and Rogan asked me if I wanted to come to dinner. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6709.120000000001s)]
*  So we went to Fogo to Chow, as you do. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6711.6s)]
*  And Bob was there and Jeremy Korbel was there as well. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6715.360000000001s)]
*  And I believed, Bob believed what he saw. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6720.52s)]
*  Now that doesn't mean that it's not advanced technology [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6726.02s)]
*  that we have, that we've created. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6728.76s)]
*  But I do believe that he was working on something [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6730.56s)]
*  and he believed it was alien spacecraft. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6733.68s)]
*  So I believe that he was being honest. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6737.84s)]
*  I could tell you why I believe his story, [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6741.96s)]
*  or at least some of it, [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6744.320000000001s)]
*  is because he talked about element 115 [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6745.780000000001s)]
*  before we even discovered element 115. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6748.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6750.360000000001s)]
*  We're talking about 25 years span in between. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6751.200000000001s)]
*  That's why the star system thing is quite interesting to me. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6753.360000000001s)]
*  So if you are describing things [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6755.76s)]
*  that have not been discovered yet, [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6759.56s)]
*  and then they do become discovered. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6761.200000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6762.72s)]
*  It adds some credibility. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6763.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6764.4800000000005s)]
*  Okay, so with your situation, you believe you saw a UFO. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6765.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6767.92s)]
*  Do you think that the UFO people, [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6768.96s)]
*  the aliens or whoever they are, [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6771.200000000001s)]
*  do you think they choose the people that see them, [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6772.72s)]
*  or this is happenstance? [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6776.280000000001s)]
*  If you start researching these alien abduction experiences [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6778.1s)]
*  or these alien sighting experiences, [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6782.580000000001s)]
*  which there are now over 7 million of them [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6784.88s)]
*  documented and move on, [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6786.76s)]
*  you start to see a similarity between the stories [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6788.82s)]
*  and repetitiveness with some of the visitations [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6792.66s)]
*  or sightings or whatever you want to call them. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6796.9s)]
*  And so it's quite possible that they isolate [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6800.299999999999s)]
*  and interact with specific people at specific times. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6803.0199999999995s)]
*  I mean, to what agenda? [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6806.0599999999995s)]
*  At the end of the day, we're like ants. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6809.299999999999s)]
*  Did you have any communication at all? [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6810.9s)]
*  Did you feel like you, [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6812.58s)]
*  did you feel anything in the moment? [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6814.219999999999s)]
*  I felt nothing in that moment. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6815.9s)]
*  I had a second experience in 2010, [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6817.26s)]
*  which is well documented, I've talked about it. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6819.22s)]
*  It took years to come out about it [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6820.740000000001s)]
*  because I basically lost my whole family over this. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6821.780000000001s)]
*  No way. Yeah. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6824.860000000001s)]
*  You came out of the closet? [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6826.7s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6828.3s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6829.14s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6829.9800000000005s)]
*  No daddy. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6830.820000000001s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6831.66s)]
*  But yeah, I did. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6833.06s)]
*  Tell me, tell me, what happened? [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6833.900000000001s)]
*  So 2010, I came home, [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6835.26s)]
*  I was working on this big project called Fort Terranova, [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6838.1s)]
*  which I built. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6841.22s)]
*  And Fort Terranova, it was on the History Channel, [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6842.54s)]
*  Countdown to Apocalypse, [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6845.58s)]
*  the Notre Dame episode. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6847.62s)]
*  And anyway, so I was working on this project. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6849.18s)]
*  I come home, I'm looking at ESPN, [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6851.98s)]
*  and I'm looking at sports at about nine o'clock PM. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6854.139999999999s)]
*  All the lights turn dim, the TV turns off, [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6856.42s)]
*  and I thought my kids were playing a trick on me [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6858.7s)]
*  because they lived up in the room behind me [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6861.0199999999995s)]
*  up on the second floor. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6863.099999999999s)]
*  And I look up and there's nobody there. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6864.0599999999995s)]
*  When I turn around, [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6866.34s)]
*  there were these two beings right there. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6867.18s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6869.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6871.139999999999s)]
*  And whew. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6872.3s)]
*  Man. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6875.0199999999995s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6875.9s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6876.74s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6877.58s)]
*  Why do you have big briefs up here? [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6878.42s)]
*  No. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6879.78s)]
*  So they were right there. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6882.86s)]
*  I'm sitting in a chair about this high, [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6883.7s)]
*  so they were right here in my eyes. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6885.0199999999995s)]
*  And... [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6886.5s)]
*  Alex is freaking out right now. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6887.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6889.9s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6890.74s)]
*  Oh, hey, hey. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6891.58s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6892.42s)]
*  This is wild. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6893.259999999999s)]
*  Okay, okay, okay. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6895.099999999999s)]
*  All right, let me get my stuff together. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6895.94s)]
*  No, no, take your time. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6897.099999999999s)]
*  So they were there. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6898.86s)]
*  They had the big almond eyes like you see on TV. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6899.9s)]
*  I swear they did. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6902.0599999999995s)]
*  So you had two beings in front of you. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6902.9s)]
*  But they didn't look like they were real eyes. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6903.9s)]
*  They didn't look like coverings of some type. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6905.5s)]
*  And they didn't communicate with me [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6908.58s)]
*  through any kind of telepathy that I can tell. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6910.7s)]
*  But I felt like my brain was shaking in my skull [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6912.5s)]
*  to the point where it started hurting. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6915.5s)]
*  And I started screaming, [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6916.5s)]
*  but no sound was coming out of my throat. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6917.62s)]
*  I can feel the air coming out, [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6920.26s)]
*  but I couldn't hear it myself. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6921.82s)]
*  And you were awake during this period. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6922.98s)]
*  You weren't taking a nap or anything like that? [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6924.26s)]
*  I was awake. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6925.1s)]
*  I'm taking a nap. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6925.94s)]
*  No psychedelics. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6926.78s)]
*  Of course, yeah. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6927.62s)]
*  And my whole house, [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6928.46s)]
*  everyone was in my wife at the time. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6929.78s)]
*  My ex-wife was in the bedroom right behind the next wall. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6932.26s)]
*  My girls were in that side of the house. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6936.34s)]
*  I split four pan. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6937.18s)]
*  My boys were in that side of the house. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6938.02s)]
*  The house was full of people. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6938.86s)]
*  Nobody heard or saw anything. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6939.7s)]
*  I was screaming. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6940.9s)]
*  Few seconds later it stops and they turn around [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6942.38s)]
*  and they don't walk like a person. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6944.74s)]
*  They kind of dangle. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6947.06s)]
*  So they kind of dangled away [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6949.06s)]
*  and they went right through the wall. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6951.06s)]
*  And then the TV comes back. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6953.26s)]
*  The lights come back to normal color. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6955.82s)]
*  That's when I went running around the house. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6957.9800000000005s)]
*  And it was just traumatic for everybody. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6959.5s)]
*  And it was like the star that broke the camel's back. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6963.34s)]
*  There was other reasons why, [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6966.34s)]
*  but I ended up just destroying my one son, Giovanni. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6967.46s)]
*  He's told me I'm scared to even come around you. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6971.78s)]
*  And still to this day, [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6973.62s)]
*  he rarely ever calls me or comes around. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6974.46s)]
*  It's kind of like I lost my son. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6976.66s)]
*  I made no money off of this. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6978.22s)]
*  I got no exposure off of this. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6979.38s)]
*  That's why I kept it quiet for so long. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6981.22s)]
*  Lost my family, created a lot of dissension. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6983.62s)]
*  I remember we were on a highway one day [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6986.860000000001s)]
*  and my wife was driving at the time, my ex-wife, [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6988.34s)]
*  and she slammed on the brakes. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6990.78s)]
*  I was like, just get out of the car. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6992.9800000000005s)]
*  Because the kids were scared. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6995.1s)]
*  And I was like, I'm sticking to my story. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6996.820000000001s)]
*  I'm not changing my story [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6998.66s)]
*  because this really happened to me. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=6999.700000000001s)]
*  And they just didn't want to hear it. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7001.38s)]
*  But her parents were Jehovah's Witnesses. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7002.38s)]
*  So everything was of the devil. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7004.18s)]
*  And so it was a pretty traumatic experience. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7007.700000000001s)]
*  Took a long time to talk about. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7009.46s)]
*  The only reason why I came out with that information [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7011.1s)]
*  was because I started running into a lot of people [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7013.18s)]
*  at conferences that would come up to me [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7016.02s)]
*  and tell me that they were having these experiences [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7017.46s)]
*  and they were horrified to talk about them. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7019.62s)]
*  So I felt like if I would talk about it, [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7021.94s)]
*  I would give them strength for them [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7023.78s)]
*  to have expressed themselves and walk in their truth [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7024.9s)]
*  and believe in their experience that they had. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7027.339999999999s)]
*  Okay, so when you started telling this story just right now, [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7029.98s)]
*  I want to point something. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7033.46s)]
*  Listen, I'm skeptical about everything. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7037.82s)]
*  I just want to let you know. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7039.78s)]
*  I could believe there was one physical sensation [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7041.0199999999995s)]
*  that I saw in you that kind of freaked me out. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7045.58s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7048.82s)]
*  Crying, people can put that on. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7049.82s)]
*  True. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7051.78s)]
*  You started to perspire. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7053.54s)]
*  I know, I know. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7055.3s)]
*  That, to me, I don't know. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7056.139999999999s)]
*  I know that actors can induce crying. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7059.42s)]
*  I don't know if they can induce sweat. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7062.94s)]
*  So to me, the tears are less of an example. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7065.66s)]
*  I mean, like your old forehead just started to sweat. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7072.86s)]
*  So maybe that is a traumatic experience [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7075.7s)]
*  of the loss of your family [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7078.86s)]
*  and that is evoking that reaction. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7080.1s)]
*  But fuck, okay. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7082.820000000001s)]
*  Were the beings, did they have like clothes on? [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7085.620000000001s)]
*  Was there anything else discernible about them? [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7087.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they didn't really have on what looked like clothes [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7089.700000000001s)]
*  to me. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7092.660000000001s)]
*  They weren't really gray. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7093.780000000001s)]
*  They were almost like brownish, [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7095.26s)]
*  but they had very big eyes, [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7096.700000000001s)]
*  two little tiny dots for noses, slit for a mouth. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7099.9800000000005s)]
*  They never opened the mouth, they never opened. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7102.620000000001s)]
*  They never moved at all. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7104.38s)]
*  They didn't even shake. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7105.3s)]
*  There was no facial movements. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7106.14s)]
*  I couldn't discern if they were even real or not real [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7107.5s)]
*  in terms of like being something that was flesh. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7110.9800000000005s)]
*  But their hands were very long and dangly [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7114.42s)]
*  like you see on TV, I swear to you. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7116.14s)]
*  And I was just like completely shocked. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7117.620000000001s)]
*  Now there's two things happened to me after this situation. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7119.9800000000005s)]
*  The first thing was, of course, [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7122.42s)]
*  I scared the hell out of everybody. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7124.38s)]
*  The second thing was, [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7125.9800000000005s)]
*  I kept hearing this voice in my head over and over again, [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7127.700000000001s)]
*  worldwide telescope, worldwide telescope, [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7131.26s)]
*  worldwide telescope, over and over and over. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7133.42s)]
*  So finally the next day I got so tired of this, [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7136.1s)]
*  I couldn't stop this noise, [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7138.34s)]
*  this phrase. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7140.7s)]
*  What was the sound of the voice? [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7141.54s)]
*  What was the? [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7142.94s)]
*  It sounded like my voice. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7143.9s)]
*  So it's your own voice. My own voice. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7145.179999999999s)]
*  Echoing worldwide telescope, worldwide. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7146.78s)]
*  Over and over and over again. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7148.78s)]
*  So I go to my computer. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7149.82s)]
*  Back then, Google wasn't a big name yet. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7151.42s)]
*  It was excite.com. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7153.219999999999s)]
*  So I get on excite.com, I type in worldwide telescope, [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7154.179999999999s)]
*  but you can type it in on Google now. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7156.7s)]
*  First thing popped up was worldwidetelescope.org, [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7159.0199999999995s)]
*  and I almost fell out of my chair. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7163.099999999999s)]
*  Worldwidetelescope.org is a site where all the space probe [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7165.5s)]
*  data from all the missions in the space exists [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7169.3s)]
*  based on taxpayer and research data. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7172.54s)]
*  So you can download this. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7176.06s)]
*  Back then you had to download it. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7177.3s)]
*  You couldn't just web, you didn't have W, where'd it go? [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7178.46s)]
*  WWW4, whatever they call it now. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7182.46s)]
*  But now you can just run it from the app, from the browser. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7184.54s)]
*  But back then you had to install it. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7187.42s)]
*  You can still install it if you want. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7188.820000000001s)]
*  I go in there, I go in and I go, okay, what is this? [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7190.9400000000005s)]
*  And I see moon, Mars, all these other planets [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7194.62s)]
*  and so forth and star systems. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7199.5s)]
*  I click on Mars. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7200.98s)]
*  I click on Mars, then I see panoramas pop up. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7202.18s)]
*  I go on panoramas, I click on panoramas. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7204.82s)]
*  Then this thing I know, I see the names of panoramas. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7207.38s)]
*  So I click on Murk Myrtle Valley. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7210.22s)]
*  I go into Murk Myrtle Valley [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7212.14s)]
*  and I start seeing things that don't belong. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7214.38s)]
*  What's a panorama? [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7216.42s)]
*  It's like a- Just an image? [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7218.38s)]
*  A wide image, but it's not just a regular image. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7219.42s)]
*  It's an image that allows you to zoom in, zoom out, pan, [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7221.66s)]
*  and zoom in left and right from the rover's perspective. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7225.54s)]
*  So you're looking at images that have been taken [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7228.38s)]
*  from spacecraft. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7230.74s)]
*  From the Mars rovers. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7231.86s)]
*  The Mars rovers. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7232.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7233.54s)]
*  Spirit rover and opportunity rover. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7234.38s)]
*  But they're of Mars or they're of? [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7236.22s)]
*  They're of Mars on Mars. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7238.3s)]
*  Got it, okay. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7239.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7240.58s)]
*  Spirit rover is no longer operating [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7241.42s)]
*  because one of the last images it transmitted [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7243.34s)]
*  looked really strange [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7245.66s)]
*  and I think they just blew it up or something. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7246.5s)]
*  They never turned it back on after that one. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7248.34s)]
*  But these things that I saw on the surface [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7250.46s)]
*  of Panorama and also Murk Myrtle Valley, [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7252.5s)]
*  they didn't look like they belonged on Mars. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7256.54s)]
*  They looked like broken down structures [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7258.22s)]
*  from the Middle East. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7260.14s)]
*  And I was like, what the hell is this? [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7261.78s)]
*  And the more I looked, [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7263.58s)]
*  the more of these anomalies I kept seeing. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7264.42s)]
*  So it led me down a whole rabbit hole into anomaly hunting. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7267.06s)]
*  That anomaly hunting got me into researching [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7269.98s)]
*  these ancient civilizations. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7273.46s)]
*  That's how it happened. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7275.42s)]
*  That's literally how it happened. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7276.94s)]
*  So because of that experience, [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7278.78s)]
*  I became an expert ancient civilizations, literally. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7281.14s)]
*  That's how I got into it. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7284.820000000001s)]
*  And do you feel, is this an example of the? [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7285.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's the Spirit Rover right there on the upper left. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7289.860000000001s)]
*  And there's a lot of anomalies. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7292.9800000000005s)]
*  We've documented so many crazy anomalies over the years. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7294.740000000001s)]
*  And I can send you some if you wanna pop them in there, [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7297.26s)]
*  just some crazy stuff that may CNN and may CNBC, Fox News. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7299.660000000001s)]
*  A lot of our stuff has been featured in the news. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7303.700000000001s)]
*  We've downloaded over 1 million of these panoramas [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7305.18s)]
*  from the space agencies. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7307.740000000001s)]
*  And we've now documented over 60,000 anomalies. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7309.42s)]
*  Things that don't belong there. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7313.3s)]
*  Everything from pyramids to unks. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7315.42s)]
*  Yeah, what is the craziest image that you have documented? [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7317.54s)]
*  The craziest image I would have to say [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7322.06s)]
*  would be this object that looks like, [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7324.02s)]
*  I gotta say looks like, [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7326.58s)]
*  cause we're not there, looks like an airplane. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7327.9s)]
*  Another one would be this statue [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7331.18s)]
*  on the side of Victoria Crater. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7332.9800000000005s)]
*  And I can pull these up and give them to you. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7335.14s)]
*  Another one would be these unks. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7337.5s)]
*  We found several unks laying around in the sand. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7338.94s)]
*  What's an unk? [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7340.78s)]
*  The Egyptian unk. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7341.82s)]
*  The cross with the loop on top. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7343.58s)]
*  Oh. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7345.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, what are those doing up there? [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7345.86s)]
*  And, and some, [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7347.86s)]
*  I'm just saying. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7349.78s)]
*  It's a plant. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7352.86s)]
*  What's that doing there? [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7353.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7354.54s)]
*  That's a good question. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7355.379999999999s)]
*  Crazy. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7360.219999999999s)]
*  So, okay, okay, okay. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7361.139999999999s)]
*  I don't want to lean too much into this, [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7362.98s)]
*  but I would be remiss if I did not ask you. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7366.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7368.38s)]
*  It must be, I would imagine [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7370.34s)]
*  if I was someone in your shoes [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7372.900000000001s)]
*  and I was, had now. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7375.46s)]
*  That's Victoria Crater by the way. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7378.46s)]
*  Man, get the fuck out of here. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7380.34s)]
*  No, that's real. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7381.54s)]
*  You can pull it up. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7382.38s)]
*  Anybody can pull these up. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7383.22s)]
*  That's what I love about these. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7384.06s)]
*  I always give the source links up. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7385.46s)]
*  Anyone can pull them up. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7386.86s)]
*  Any person. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7388.22s)]
*  Now obviously that's been colorized [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7389.06s)]
*  to make it more visible. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7390.26s)]
*  To make it pop out, yeah. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7391.46s)]
*  There it goes, uncolorized. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7392.54s)]
*  But even uncolorized, [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7393.7s)]
*  it's still just a little bit crazy. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7394.74s)]
*  That's fair. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7396.58s)]
*  There's even more on that crater, [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7397.42s)]
*  but it's to the left, [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7399.22s)]
*  which that's not a good, [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7400.34s)]
*  it's not a wide panoramic shot, [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7401.82s)]
*  but there's more, a lot more there. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7403.26s)]
*  Okay, so again, I would be remiss not to ask this. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7405.86s)]
*  You have a sighting with a UFO, [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7409.5s)]
*  then you have an interaction with beings, [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7411.3s)]
*  and then you have a message to go look up these images. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7415.58s)]
*  I would imagine someone in your shoes, [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7419.82s)]
*  it would be very difficult to not follow [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7422.66s)]
*  this, I don't even wanna say line of thinking, [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7426.42s)]
*  but follow this, [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7429.7s)]
*  this, they've almost like, they've almost like [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7430.86s)]
*  edged you in a direction. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7433.82s)]
*  It would be very difficult to not run down that hallway. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7435.22s)]
*  So I would imagine it would be hard [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7440.22s)]
*  for a person in your shoes, [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7443.74s)]
*  after having these experiences, [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7444.86s)]
*  to not think, hey, they want me to go look into this stuff. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7446.26s)]
*  Is that kind of what you feel? [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7451.900000000001s)]
*  That's a fact. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7454.02s)]
*  What I've done is to try to combat [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7455.0s)]
*  the nudging that's happened. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7459.88s)]
*  I always keep digging into the science. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7462.4800000000005s)]
*  So I've talked to geologists, I've talked to scientists, [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7464.68s)]
*  I've talked to engineers, I've talked to homegrown guides, [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7466.72s)]
*  archeologists, indigenous people from all around the world. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7469.2s)]
*  I keep digging and trying to debunk my own theories. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7471.8s)]
*  Got it, okay. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7476.400000000001s)]
*  And the deeper I dig to debunk, the less I debunk. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7477.24s)]
*  Because you've heard these stories, [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7480.4800000000005s)]
*  listen, and I'm not trying, [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7481.6s)]
*  we're not here to discredit you. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7482.64s)]
*  I literally wanna do this podcast [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7483.72s)]
*  because I was just like, take us fucking deep, [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7485.360000000001s)]
*  this is gonna be so much fun. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7486.92s)]
*  I don't care about the science or the fact, [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7488.4800000000005s)]
*  I wanna just hear the craziest shit that you gotta say. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7490.72s)]
*  I did not know you were gonna talk [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7493.64s)]
*  about fucking meeting aliens, that's kinda gross. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7494.64s)]
*  Okay, but I can also imagine that if that happened to me, [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7496.52s)]
*  I would go down this rabbit hole [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7501.64s)]
*  and I would just see how deep it would go. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7503.400000000001s)]
*  And I would also maybe even feel [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7505.4800000000005s)]
*  like it was my purpose to do this thing, right? [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7507.52s)]
*  They've chosen me and what have they chosen me to do? [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7510.0s)]
*  So if you do feel that way, [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7514.04s)]
*  one, why do you think they've chosen you? [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7516.32s)]
*  And two, what do you think that your purpose is? [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7518.2s)]
*  Yeah, I always consider that, like why me? [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7521.92s)]
*  Why did this happen to me? [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7524.24s)]
*  The only thing I could think of is that [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7526.72s)]
*  I have a high retention for information. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7528.0s)]
*  My recall ability is incredible [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7530.2s)]
*  in a lot of the stuff that I talk about, [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7532.76s)]
*  especially when I'm passionate about it. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7534.68s)]
*  Probably everyone does, they just maybe don't realize it, [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7536.44s)]
*  but maybe they saw my ability to consume [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7538.92s)]
*  a lot of information and my ability to travel the world. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7542.84s)]
*  I've been around the world 38 times now. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7545.68s)]
*  Last year, I spent nine months in hotels. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7548.12s)]
*  Not many people can do that and still make a living [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7551.24s)]
*  and do what they do. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7553.84s)]
*  So maybe they have a way of understanding like, [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7555.2s)]
*  hey, this guy has the skills, the tools, [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7557.8s)]
*  and the capacity to really grasp this. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7560.56s)]
*  And why is it important that you grasp it? [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7564.28s)]
*  Why is it important to them that you share this? [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7566.32s)]
*  That's what I'm trying to understand. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7569.5199999999995s)]
*  What are they trying to get to? [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7570.719999999999s)]
*  This is what my hypothesis that I came up with. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7571.84s)]
*  Human beings are an abandoned seed colony on this planet. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7575.24s)]
*  And we have had some influence due to people violating [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7578.84s)]
*  what I would call a prime directive. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7582.12s)]
*  We've been engaged in a way [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7584.4s)]
*  that we weren't supposed to be engaged. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7585.5599999999995s)]
*  And we've been given technologies [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7587.04s)]
*  that have sped us up far past where we should be right now, [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7589.679999999999s)]
*  including here this AI thing is coming, right? [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7594.24s)]
*  And that's no oversight, no nothing. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7596.639999999999s)]
*  And it's just being unleashed on us. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7598.639999999999s)]
*  Again, more advancement in the blink of an eye [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7600.32s)]
*  that we're not ready for, spiritually or consciously. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7602.679999999999s)]
*  And it put us in a predicament. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7605.44s)]
*  And I believe that there are people out there [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7607.12s)]
*  that are watching us, I do mean people, [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7608.879999999999s)]
*  that are watching us and observing us to see [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7611.4s)]
*  when we're gonna go from being babies [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7614.719999999999s)]
*  that are learning how to crawl, to learning how to walk, [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7616.799999999999s)]
*  to learning how to run, to being adolescents, [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7620.08s)]
*  to even then becoming, consciously in the spirit, [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7622.12s)]
*  to becoming full grown adults. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7624.76s)]
*  I think that mankind is a baby learning how to crawl. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7626.4s)]
*  And every now and then when a baby learns how to crawl, [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7630.72s)]
*  it plops down on his stomach, right? [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7632.96s)]
*  Cause it has to get the strength. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7634.5199999999995s)]
*  We plopped down on our stomach a few times. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7636.28s)]
*  Those will be some of the hiccups [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7638.16s)]
*  in our civilization right now. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7639.4s)]
*  Eventually we will grab onto the edge of a table [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7641.8s)]
*  and pull ourselves up and start taking steps. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7643.8s)]
*  What are the hiccups? [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7645.64s)]
*  Hiccups, racism, slavery, inquisitions, [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7646.92s)]
*  religion. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7652.4s)]
*  Atomic bombs maybe? [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7653.24s)]
*  Atomic bombs, technologies that we're not ready for. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7654.32s)]
*  All these things are the hiccups, right? [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7657.88s)]
*  Police brutality, my dad was killed by police. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7661.32s)]
*  And so all these things, you look at it [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7664.2s)]
*  and from a perspective of right now, [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7667.0s)]
*  it looks like things are getting worse, [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7670.04s)]
*  but it's actually the greatest time to be alive. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7671.88s)]
*  There's no bubonic plague, there's no black plague, [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7674.76s)]
*  there's no Spanish flu. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7676.64s)]
*  Those things almost wiped out human beings. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7677.72s)]
*  There's no papal inquisitions, [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7679.8s)]
*  there's no American Holocaust, which nobody talks about. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7681.4s)]
*  111 million indigenous natives of the Americas [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7683.759999999999s)]
*  slaughtered in 70 years. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7686.16s)]
*  Nobody talks about that, but that happened. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7688.2s)]
*  And so that's not happening. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7690.759999999999s)]
*  I can go outside, you can go outside. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7691.96s)]
*  We don't see dead bodies laid all over the street right now. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7693.599999999999s)]
*  Now are there things going on like in Israel and Iran [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7697.04s)]
*  and all these other things? [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7699.28s)]
*  Yes, but overall, on a mass consensus, [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7700.12s)]
*  it's the greatest time to be alive. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7703.879999999999s)]
*  And so we're at the stage now where we have an opportunity [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7705.839999999999s)]
*  to grab onto the edge of the table [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7709.5599999999995s)]
*  and pull ourselves up and begin to take those first steps. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7710.88s)]
*  But after we take that step, what's gonna happen? [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7714.08s)]
*  We're gonna fall and we're gonna cry. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7716.6s)]
*  But the challenge is when we pull ourselves back up, [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7719.4400000000005s)]
*  how long will it take for us to get a good walking gait? [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7723.2s)]
*  What is the definition of walking? [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7726.6s)]
*  Controlled falls. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7728.28s)]
*  We have to learn how to control our fall. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7730.04s)]
*  That's how you achieve a golden age. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7731.96s)]
*  And I think that they're waiting at some point for us to see, [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7733.92s)]
*  for us to realize when we can stand up [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7738.44s)]
*  and we can start taking those steps in the right direction. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7741.08s)]
*  And then they give us some good shit again or? [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7743.48s)]
*  It's quite possible. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7745.32s)]
*  That gives us the ability to get open communication. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7746.24s)]
*  So like, okay, we trust you now. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7749.799999999999s)]
*  Or we have to get to a certain level consciously [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7751.12s)]
*  before other technologies can be revealed. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7752.959999999999s)]
*  I mean, I don't know, I'm just guessing at this point, [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7755.44s)]
*  but I think they're waiting to see how long will [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7757.0s)]
*  eight billion people allow 100 families to control them? [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7759.639999999999s)]
*  Eight billion people. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7764.68s)]
*  Are being controlled by 100 families. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7766.360000000001s)]
*  Who are these families? [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7768.400000000001s)]
*  These are the elite oligarchs that control the planet. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7769.72s)]
*  They literally run us. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7772.96s)]

*  Where we can go, where we can't go. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7777.8s)]
*  Don't cross over that invisible line because if you do, [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7779.200000000001s)]
*  you're illegal and all this other kind of crazy stuff. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7781.92s)]
*  They're running us. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7784.280000000001s)]
*  And we are, governments are put in place [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7785.200000000001s)]
*  to work for the people, but they got it flipped [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7787.92s)]
*  and they got us working for them. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7790.0s)]
*  And telling us what they're gonna do to us [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7791.64s)]
*  if we don't listen to them, [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7793.599999999999s)]
*  that's the opposite of what it's supposed to be. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7795.0s)]
*  So at some point- [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7797.0s)]
*  So isn't this what they learned from the- [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7797.839999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, learned it. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7799.799999999999s)]
*  Anunnaki or something? [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7800.639999999999s)]
*  They learned it and they learned it real well. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7801.48s)]
*  That's what the Anunnaki, at least that's what you're saying [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7803.4s)]
*  that they did for the human race, right? [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7805.2s)]
*  But the problem, the reason why the world it is today, [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7806.679999999999s)]
*  why we have this boot on our neck is because of us. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7809.16s)]
*  We're the problem. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7813.08s)]
*  The eight billion are the problem. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7814.16s)]
*  Not them. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7815.5599999999995s)]
*  Because we haven't elevated our consciousness [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7816.4s)]
*  to the level that- [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7817.679999999999s)]
*  They're sharks. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7819.36s)]
*  A shark smells blood, a shark attacks. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7820.32s)]
*  A shark is gonna be a shark. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7822.6s)]
*  How come we as eight billion people haven't stopped falling [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7824.320000000001s)]
*  for these divide and conquer tactics [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7828.400000000001s)]
*  and stop fighting each other over the scraps [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7830.72s)]
*  and realize who the real enemy is? [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7834.200000000001s)]
*  While we're fighting each other, [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7837.280000000001s)]
*  they're just cutting up the pie and laughing at us. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7838.92s)]
*  Left wing, right wing, all the same bird, right? [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7841.84s)]
*  There's no such thing as a Democrat or Republican. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7844.92s)]
*  The only thing that does exist, like I say, [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7847.6s)]
*  is a group of elite oligarchs [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7849.64s)]
*  that torture men, women, and children worldwide. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7851.12s)]
*  That exists. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7853.5199999999995s)]
*  Democrat, Republican, doesn't exist. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7854.76s)]
*  Now how can we be so sure that those people [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7857.04s)]
*  are not working with the beings that you saw? [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7861.24s)]
*  And maybe they're doing the bidding of those beings. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7863.96s)]
*  We can't be. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7866.08s)]
*  Those beings might not be benevolent. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7866.92s)]
*  They may not be. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7868.76s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7869.96s)]
*  All I could tell you is what my hypothesis is. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7870.8s)]
*  And I feel that when mankind realizes [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7873.2s)]
*  that we're all bent over with a big table on our back, [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7876.16s)]
*  a playing board, when we stand up, [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7879.68s)]
*  the table falls off of our backs and the game is over. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7882.08s)]
*  And standing up means unity, loving one another, [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7886.200000000001s)]
*  treating you and everyone else like brother and sister, [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7889.52s)]
*  understanding that we are all just different aspects [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7893.280000000001s)]
*  of one another and realizing that everything is conscious. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7895.72s)]
*  And then we get to the next level. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7901.12s)]
*  Until then, it's gonna be this whole, [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7903.16s)]
*  I'm better than you and you're better than me. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7906.08s)]
*  You see the rap civil war going on [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7907.8s)]
*  and all these crazy things going on. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7910.64s)]
*  I mean, we have to get above and beyond that [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7912.08s)]
*  to the next level. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7915.0s)]
*  And then humanity will really take huge strides. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7916.4400000000005s)]
*  Do you wish that that experience never happened to you? [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7919.64s)]
*  I used to in the beginning, [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7923.12s)]
*  but now I see that it put me on the path where I am. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7924.52s)]
*  I'm extremely happy now. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7927.0s)]
*  I'm married again. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7929.8s)]
*  I've got a fresh start. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7931.64s)]
*  I'm very happy I found somebody on the same frequency as me [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7933.72s)]
*  that works side by side with me [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7937.92s)]
*  and understands and travels with me. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7939.679999999999s)]
*  One of the hardest thing to do is travel with somebody [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7941.88s)]
*  and be gone for nine months in like deserts and stuff. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7943.799999999999s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7947.04s)]
*  So I found somebody that really gets it. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7947.88s)]
*  And so I'm really in a really good place right now. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7950.16s)]
*  And the business is being built utilizing my passion. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7952.639999999999s)]
*  I walked away from my call center business, [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7956.719999999999s)]
*  even though it was very successful. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7958.5599999999995s)]
*  I walked away from it. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7959.799999999999s)]
*  I gave my share to the other partners [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7961.2s)]
*  and just jumped off the cliff and said, [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7962.839999999999s)]
*  I'm just going into the knowledge thing. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7965.12s)]
*  That's all I'm gonna do. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7966.72s)]
*  And didn't really have a plan or anything in the beginning. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7968.08s)]
*  But, and then I waited seven years to monetize it, [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7970.76s)]
*  but everything is going as planned. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7973.16s)]
*  So I think everything happens in divine time. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7975.320000000001s)]
*  And I think I'm right where I'm supposed to be. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7977.2s)]
*  Do you wish you did anything different [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7978.68s)]
*  when you saw the aliens? [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7981.400000000001s)]
*  You wish you said anything? [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7982.72s)]
*  I couldn't. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7984.76s)]
*  I couldn't say anything. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7985.6s)]
*  But I'm sure you think back to that moment. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7986.84s)]
*  Do you wish you tried to communicate telepathically? [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7988.84s)]
*  Do you think you fucked it up? [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7991.92s)]
*  Do you like, damn, this was my one moment. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7993.2s)]
*  I just screamed. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7994.88s)]
*  I don't think so. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7996.32s)]
*  I think whatever that shaking was, [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7997.16s)]
*  it did something to me. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=7999.44s)]
*  Maybe they were just trying to put something in my head. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8000.28s)]
*  I mean, I have no idea. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8001.88s)]
*  Are you familiar with Alastair Crowley's depiction of lamb? [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8003.04s)]
*  No. Have you heard of this? [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8006.32s)]
*  Alastair Crowley's depiction of a lamb? [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8007.36s)]
*  Of the entity that he was talking to. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8008.96s)]
*  Oh, the entity. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8011.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8012.36s)]
*  Was that similar to what you saw? [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8013.92s)]
*  Can you bring it up? [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8015.16s)]
*  It's, that's horrifying. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8016.639999999999s)]
*  More like a clown. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8018.08s)]
*  Like it's just like that big overhead, right? [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8019.44s)]
*  When it kind of goes out like this. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8022.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8024.0s)]
*  No, it wasn't like that. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8024.84s)]
*  It was more like the, [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8025.66s)]
*  almost like the ones you see in the movies, [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8027.74s)]
*  which means it told me right away [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8029.26s)]
*  that these movie directors [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8031.18s)]
*  or whoever is writing these movies, [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8032.26s)]
*  they know what these people look like. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8033.66s)]
*  So not like that. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8035.3s)]
*  You see how it's big? [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8036.3s)]
*  He said it's more like a big out like that [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8037.139999999999s)]
*  with a big brow in the front. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8039.78s)]
*  It didn't look like that, no. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8041.26s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that he didn't see that. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8042.98s)]
*  I mean, there's so many different people [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8045.58s)]
*  that exist in the universe. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8047.62s)]
*  Do you feel like we're in end times right now? [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8050.82s)]
*  Like, would you make anything of like end time revelations [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8052.86s)]
*  or like biblical revelations of us being in the final days? [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8056.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I looked into all of that. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8059.98s)]
*  And I, you know, I personally feel [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8061.339999999999s)]
*  that we're in the beginning of times. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8063.299999999999s)]
*  I think we're going into a new age. [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8065.58s)]
*  We're heading into the age of Aquarius pretty soon. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8066.94s)]
*  And we're in the age of discovery, revelation and growth. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8069.94s)]
*  And I don't believe in end times doctrine. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8074.0599999999995s)]
*  I think that the end times doctrine [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8076.299999999999s)]
*  has been preached over and over again [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8077.98s)]
*  to keep mankind believing that he's stuck [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8079.74s)]
*  and there's a cap over his head. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8082.38s)]
*  I really truly believe that right now is, like I said before, [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8084.34s)]
*  one of the greatest times to be alive. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8087.22s)]
*  And I believe that we're in the beginning. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8089.22s)]
*  So people say, it's coming to an end. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8091.26s)]
*  It's go, no, we're coming to the beginning. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8092.54s)]
*  The beginning, like the Mayans said, [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8094.82s)]
*  we've gone through four worlds [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8096.46s)]
*  and we're heading into the fifth. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8097.74s)]
*  They weren't talking about destruction. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8099.5s)]
*  They're talking about a fifth world in consciousness. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8100.82s)]
*  And I think that we're at the precipice now [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8103.82s)]
*  of going into the next level. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8105.58s)]
*  And there's a fork in the road coming. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8107.58s)]
*  Do we go down this side or do we go down this way? [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8109.22s)]
*  And so hopefully we're nudging, [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8112.5s)]
*  we meaning this podcast and many other people [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8114.66s)]
*  are nudging people in the right direction [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8116.62s)]
*  to get them to wake up, question their reality, [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8119.02s)]
*  question themselves, ask questions, do better research, [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8121.02s)]
*  stay away from the foolishness [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8124.820000000001s)]
*  and try to elevate themselves. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8126.42s)]
*  Do you think Christ will return? [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8128.46s)]
*  I don't think the Christ will return [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8130.58s)]
*  in the sense that people believe a being [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8132.26s)]
*  is just gonna come back riding on a cloud. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8134.26s)]
*  I believe that the return of Christ [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8137.06s)]
*  is the Christ consciousness. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8139.26s)]
*  I believe Christ said that the Christ will return [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8141.34s)]
*  the Christ consciousness in each and every one of us. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8143.9400000000005s)]
*  Each and every one of us has the crystallized consciousness [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8147.14s)]
*  and you can achieve that through growth, [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8149.860000000001s)]
*  through personal growth. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8151.580000000001s)]
*  And I believe that the return is when everyone [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8153.06s)]
*  obtains the same level of frequency of love, peace, [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8156.740000000001s)]
*  and respect, dignity, and elevation. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8160.820000000001s)]
*  We all become adept initiates, we all rise [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8163.5s)]
*  and we all return at the same time. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8166.3s)]
*  It takes a certain number of people [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8168.46s)]
*  to achieve a certain level, like that monkey effect [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8169.820000000001s)]
*  where a certain amount of people get that frequency, [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8174.3s)]
*  the mass expands around the planet. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8177.26s)]
*  And I think that the Christ is a consciousness [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8179.02s)]
*  that's gonna return to the planet, [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8181.02s)]
*  not a person coming from the clouds. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8182.9400000000005s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8187.14s)]
*  Fascinating. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8187.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8188.820000000001s)]
*  That's a lot. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8189.66s)]
*  I think so. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8190.5s)]
*  Billy, this is some wild shit, man. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8191.34s)]
*  I understand you don't wanna change or fuck [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8195.3s)]
*  what your minds make up, but I really think [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8197.14s)]
*  you should dive into like, I was good, [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8201.98s)]
*  and some of that stuff. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8204.02s)]
*  Only because, so I had a past life regression. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8205.02s)]
*  And there was a moment where it's like, [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8209.38s)]
*  I couldn't see my grandmother, but for some reason, [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8212.78s)]
*  I just knew my grandmother was there. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8215.62s)]
*  And it was kinda how you explained that scenario, [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8217.58s)]
*  where it's like, our mouths aren't moving, [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8219.9s)]
*  we're not communicating, but at the same time, [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8222.54s)]
*  there's some level of communication. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8224.78s)]
*  And I was like, oh, that was like eerily similar to. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8226.300000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8230.060000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so I was like, you might wanna jump into that, [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8230.900000000001s)]
*  you've explored everything else. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8232.820000000002s)]
*  That's one realm that you haven't touched yet. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8234.86s)]
*  Yeah, I'll back up my memory first into a DNA hard drive, [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8236.660000000002s)]
*  because they have those now. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8240.220000000001s)]
*  And then I'll, just in case, I'll have a backup. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8241.140000000001s)]
*  So that is the concern for you, [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8243.54s)]
*  is that if you do these hallucinogenic drugs, [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8245.5s)]
*  that you could some way alter your brain chemistry, [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8248.820000000002s)]
*  and then you would lose all of the productivity [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8251.34s)]
*  that you've had. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8255.38s)]
*  Because I know right now, myself and my wife, [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8256.38s)]
*  we know three people that are gone. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8258.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8260.779999999999s)]
*  Gone, out there like, they're gone. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8261.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8264.699999999999s)]
*  I don't know if you can get them back. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8265.539999999999s)]
*  And so, it's like. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8266.619999999999s)]
*  From psychedelics? [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8269.22s)]
*  Yeah, now my wife has done psychedelics. [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8270.179999999998s)]
*  She did mushrooms once or twice, [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8271.5s)]
*  and it worked out great for her. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8273.42s)]
*  And she knows a few people that have done it as well. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8276.34s)]
*  Worked out phenomenal, I think it's a great tool. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8277.98s)]
*  I'm just like, whew, let me get my memory. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8280.62s)]
*  The risk is too high. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8282.58s)]
*  Let me get my brain backed up. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8283.54s)]
*  Thoth would back up his entire consciousness [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8285.300000000001s)]
*  and transfer it from one body to another [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8287.660000000002s)]
*  inside these rejuvenation chambers [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8290.380000000001s)]
*  that he talks about, the halls of a mentee. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8291.980000000001s)]
*  Which is now, the 2045 project in Russia [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8294.660000000002s)]
*  is working on the same thing. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8297.86s)]
*  They've already transferred a monkey's mind into a computer. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8299.380000000001s)]
*  And now they're doing human mind into a robot, [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8302.86s)]
*  and then by 2045, a human mind into an actual avatar. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8305.62s)]
*  And so, let me get that back up. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8310.259999999998s)]
*  I think we're working on that as well. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8312.22s)]
*  Yeah, the avatar project. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8313.619999999999s)]
*  I think the CEO of like Sirius XM or something like that, [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8314.619999999999s)]
*  I think it downloaded his wife's consciousness or something [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8318.3s)]
*  onto some form of AIs [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8322.019999999999s)]
*  so we could interact with them. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8323.699999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of tech out there. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8325.099999999999s)]
*  I mean, the avatar project has been doing it for years [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8326.06s)]
*  with DARPA. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8328.82s)]
*  What's DARPA? [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8329.82s)]
*  DARPA, that's the black budget program [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8330.82s)]
*  for the American military. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8333.66s)]
*  They have to take all your trillions of dollars, [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8335.42s)]
*  you don't know what they're doing with it. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8336.82s)]
*  So, they have been working on the avatar project. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8338.5s)]
*  They actually have it live already [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8340.74s)]
*  where a field robot in a bunker somewhere [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8341.78s)]
*  controls a robot. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8344.34s)]
*  A field soldier in a bunker controls a field robot [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8345.66s)]
*  thousands of miles away. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8350.22s)]
*  Consciousness link. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8351.74s)]
*  Can feel, can move, can see. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8353.58s)]
*  Holy shit. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8355.54s)]
*  But it's not really there. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8356.380000000001s)]
*  So if the robot gets blown up, [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8357.42s)]
*  the soldier's still alive. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8359.66s)]
*  I mean, yeah, that's better. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8361.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8363.06s)]
*  Oh, yay, yay. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8365.1s)]

*  Yeah, no. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8368.380000000001s)]
*  Because you don't have to be concerned [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8369.220000000001s)]
*  with the casualties of war [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8370.34s)]

*  Yeah, they just put the AI in a real fighter jet [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8373.660000000002s)]
*  and had it fight in a dog fight. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8376.62s)]
*  Well, that's what drones are essentially, right? [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8378.660000000002s)]
*  So that's got Skynet is online. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8381.140000000001s)]
*  Skynet's online. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8384.980000000001s)]

*  that people should be looking into [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8391.78s)]
*  or that are concerning you right now globally? [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8392.86s)]
*  Well, I know everyone was thinking that the, [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8394.94s)]
*  I don't know, is it going on YouTube? [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8397.060000000001s)]
*  I gotta watch my words then. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8399.060000000001s)]
*  The trails of the sky. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8401.300000000001s)]
*  Chemtrails. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8403.42s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, yeah. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8404.26s)]
*  People were thinking that those were big conspiracies, [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8405.18s)]
*  but I think that what happened in Dubai recently [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8408.300000000001s)]
*  just proved that it's not. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8409.980000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's just weather. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8411.5s)]
*  They're just seeding the clouds. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8412.86s)]

*  They're seeding the clouds, they're making weather. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8415.460000000001s)]
*  Those trails that they spent, [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8416.86s)]
*  they paid $3,000 per flight to drop that stuff in the sky, [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8418.460000000001s)]
*  sodium iodide and other chemicals, [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8422.300000000001s)]
*  and look what it created, a disaster. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8425.18s)]
*  And the reason why this planet is cooling off so much [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8427.140000000001s)]
*  is because of these trails. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8429.460000000001s)]
*  Oh, really? [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8430.7s)]
*  Yeah, that's why it's cold in California. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8431.54s)]
*  You can't even go to LA without a jacket anymore. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8433.18s)]
*  It's chilly, for me it's chilly in Florida [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8435.460000000001s)]
*  when it drops into like 79, 80. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8437.5s)]
*  And I'm freezing up here. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8439.62s)]
*  When I got off the plane, I was dead almost. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8441.26s)]
*  But 54 degrees, I was like, what? [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8444.060000000001s)]
*  But this cooling effect is happening [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8446.5s)]
*  because of these particulates [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8448.18s)]
*  that they're dropping in the sky, and they're real. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8449.220000000001s)]
*  And now you can actually go online [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8452.78s)]
*  and Google geoengineering contract. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8454.26s)]
*  And if you have a plane and a company, [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8456.74s)]
*  you can apply for a private contract [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8458.86s)]
*  to drop this stuff in the sky for the government. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8463.300000000001s)]
*  Why do you think the government's teasing [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8468.1s)]
*  all these UFO whistleblowers now? [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8469.26s)]
*  And why do you think all those projects [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8471.42s)]
*  are happening right now? [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8472.58s)]
*  Well, they're trying to get ahead of the game. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8473.74s)]
*  So the UFO thing has come to a full head, they're real. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8476.060000000001s)]
*  But also we have some as well, UAPs, right? [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8480.1s)]
*  But they know what they are, we made them. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8483.26s)]
*  And so now what they're saying is, [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8486.460000000001s)]
*  where can we get more money? [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8487.94s)]
*  There just isn't enough money in wars anymore [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8489.9s)]
*  because we killed everybody. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8491.82s)]
*  We already took over every country. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8492.86s)]
*  There's nowhere else to go. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8494.58s)]
*  I think one of the only central banks [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8496.140000000001s)]
*  that are untouched is Iran. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8497.66s)]
*  And there's no real money over there, [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8499.86s)]
*  so they're just not gonna touch it. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8501.02s)]
*  But what they said was, wow, we can still take money [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8502.5s)]
*  if there's a war, a pending war from space. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8504.94s)]
*  So we have the Space Force. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8508.38s)]
*  Now we're gonna get one of these UAPs potentially [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8510.5s)]
*  to do what we had happening in the Gulf of Tonkin incident [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8515.42s)]
*  that started the Vietnam War. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8518.22s)]
*  It's gonna attack one of our ships. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8519.82s)]
*  And now everybody's gonna be pissed off. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8522.22s)]
*  Get them. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8524.339999999998s)]
*  Now we're gonna send trillions of dollars [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8525.259999999998s)]
*  without questioning into this space war [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8527.019999999999s)]
*  that they created to fund projects that they own, [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8530.82s)]
*  that they sit on the board of directors of, [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8534.5s)]
*  that they're taking underground seed money from, [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8535.9s)]
*  and building these multi-billion dollar weapons [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8539.02s)]
*  that will never see the light of day, [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8541.94s)]
*  and siphoning money from the sweat of our backs. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8544.06s)]
*  So it's just a phony war to prop the economy. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8547.82s)]
*  It's a moneymaker. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8551.7s)]
*  All these companies, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8555.58s)]
*  they're gonna do what they always do. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8558.66s)]
*  They'll tell the government, [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8559.94s)]
*  oh, we'll put a bid in for this brand new fighter jet. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8560.78s)]
*  And they'll take $15 billion down payment. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8563.380000000001s)]
*  They'll work on it for 15 years and say, [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8568.86s)]
*  oh, it didn't work. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8569.74s)]
*  We need another $5 billion [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8570.58s)]
*  to see if we can fix these couple things on it. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8571.58s)]
*  Maybe we can get it to fly. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8573.380000000001s)]
*  They give them another $5 billion, never works. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8574.9s)]
*  You're talking about the F-35? [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8577.34s)]
*  There's as many of them. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8579.220000000001s)]
*  That's just one of many. [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8580.060000000001s)]
*  They'll scratch that and do another one. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8581.060000000001s)]
*  But meanwhile, they've made billions of dollars [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8582.74s)]
*  off of nothing. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8585.140000000001s)]
*  And they do it over and over and over again. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8586.5s)]
*  And that's the technique they use. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8589.26s)]
*  Now, hey, we'll just take a couple trillion [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8590.5s)]
*  and we'll put it into the space force [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8593.26s)]
*  because we need space weapons. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8595.060000000001s)]
*  Do you think we went to the moon? [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8597.18s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8598.54s)]
*  I believe we went to the moon, but we lied about it. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8599.42s)]
*  And what I mean by that is yes, we went to the moon. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8602.220000000001s)]
*  But when you analyze several things, the footage, [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8604.9s)]
*  you see a mix of real footage [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8608.34s)]
*  and you see a mix of artificial footage. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8609.82s)]
*  That's my thinking too. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8611.9s)]
*  Now, why is that? [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8613.66s)]
*  I had to dig into this deeper. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8615.02s)]
*  They discovered on the moon [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8616.98s)]
*  that there were artificial structures. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8618.5s)]
*  There's evidence of war on the moon. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8620.78s)]
*  There's debris laying all over the place. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8623.220000000001s)]
*  The moon mission was a reconnaissance mission. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8627.1s)]
*  And the race to the moon between us and Russia [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8629.5s)]
*  was who's gonna get their hands [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8632.18s)]
*  on that ancient technology first [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8633.539999999999s)]
*  and bring it back and reverse engineer it. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8636.46s)]
*  That's what the whole moon mission was all about. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8639.22s)]
*  And that's why they show you this barren landscape, [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8641.1s)]
*  fake video. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8643.859999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile, it's all about getting the technology [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8645.1s)]
*  that's laying around. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8647.74s)]
*  China sent a rover up there and it got stuck in the debris [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8648.779999999999s)]
*  and it transmitted an image back before they can delete it. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8653.06s)]
*  And that went worldwide. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8656.38s)]
*  It was global. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8657.38s)]
*  That was like five years ago. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8658.22s)]
*  Yeah, China, China rover stuck in the debris on the moon. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8660.019999999999s)]
*  I went and researched the Clementine mission. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8663.58s)]
*  It was a military former top secret mission [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8666.46s)]
*  that became declassified. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8669.5s)]
*  And as soon as I saw the name Clementine, [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8671.179999999998s)]
*  I knew what it meant. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8672.98s)]
*  It never came back. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8673.82s)]
*  Oh my darling Clementine, you were lost and gone forever. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8675.14s)]
*  I said, come on. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8678.42s)]
*  I knew this thing didn't come back [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8679.259999999998s)]
*  and it never came back. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8680.099999999999s)]
*  When it got, it was a low lunar orbit mission [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8681.46s)]
*  to go around the moon in a low lunar orbit. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8683.619999999999s)]
*  And it got to the backside, [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8685.78s)]
*  what they call the dark side of the moon. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8687.1s)]
*  It crashed into something. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8688.86s)]
*  But on its way there, it transmitted gigs of images back, [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8690.820000000002s)]
*  which was made publicly available. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8695.18s)]
*  And those images have a lot of anomalies in them, [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8697.42s)]
*  things that shouldn't be there. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8700.220000000001s)]
*  So we know for a fact that there's something going on [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8702.02s)]
*  with the moon for real. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8704.380000000001s)]
*  And we got the FOIA, the Freedom of Information Act [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8705.460000000001s)]
*  on the black box audio from Apollo 11 [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8708.74s)]
*  and anyone can download it now. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8712.26s)]
*  And guess what it says? [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8713.7s)]
*  It was one of the documentaries I'm in. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8714.54s)]
*  The astronaut is looking, what's his name? [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8717.94s)]
*  Neil Armstrong, he's looking down. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8720.300000000001s)]
*  He says, look at those concave structures down there. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8723.460000000001s)]
*  I bet the people down there never get out. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8727.62s)]
*  That's on the black box audio from Apollo 11. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8730.380000000001s)]
*  He wasn't joking. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8733.660000000002s)]
*  And so what people, what is he talking about? [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8735.300000000001s)]
*  And why would he say that form of a dome, [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8738.060000000001s)]
*  that form of a structure will make a dome, not a crater? [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8740.740000000002s)]
*  So he's using code to say there's a dome down there [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8744.14s)]
*  and there's people inside of it. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8746.58s)]
*  When they got, Apollo 10, [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8748.18s)]
*  when they got to the backside of the moon, the dark side, [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8749.66s)]
*  coms, you're out of reach of coms now [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8752.34s)]
*  because the moon is blocking you from earth. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8753.74s)]
*  Well, something hacked into their coms [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8757.019999999999s)]
*  and started playing this weird music in their coms [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8759.18s)]
*  from that side of the moon, [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8761.9s)]
*  this weird whistling musical notes sound thing. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8763.18s)]
*  And they all freaked out. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8765.699999999999s)]
*  And that's on the black box FOIA as well. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8766.619999999999s)]
*  Wait, really? [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8768.74s)]
*  Yeah. Oh yeah. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8769.58s)]
*  There's a recording from the dark side of the moon. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8770.82s)]
*  That's right. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8773.14s)]
*  And they were like, [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8774.82s)]
*  do you hear that? [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8775.66s)]
*  Do you hear that? [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8776.5s)]
*  Yeah, I hear it too. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8777.34s)]
*  I hear it. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8778.18s)]
*  I hear it. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8779.02s)]
*  What is that? [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8779.84s)]
*  What is that? [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8780.68s)]
*  They were freaking out like crazy. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8781.52s)]
*  They got their coms got hacked [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8783.82s)]
*  on the dark side of the moon. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8785.46s)]
*  Couldn't we see the debris with like telescopes, [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8786.58s)]
*  like hobby telescopes? [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8788.619999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8790.34s)]
*  If you have a Celestron 130, [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8791.18s)]
*  which is what I do, a Celestron 130, [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8792.82s)]
*  you can see stuff on the moon. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8794.9s)]
*  If you know where to look, [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8796.42s)]
*  which basins to look into, [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8797.26s)]
*  you can see stuff out there. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8799.02s)]
*  And so what happened to the moon? [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8800.619999999999s)]
*  You can see stuff out there. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8802.42s)]
*  Now, is it crystal clear what you're looking at? [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8804.1s)]
*  No, because of the earth's atmosphere [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8805.86s)]
*  and the haze sometimes, [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8807.460000000001s)]
*  or the cloud cover, [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8808.5s)]
*  or some of the atmosphere kind of catches wavy look. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8809.5s)]
*  But there's a lot of images pre-Photoshop [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8813.58s)]
*  that you can get right on nasa.gov [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8817.1s)]
*  that clearly will show you objects are there, [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8819.82s)]
*  things that don't belong. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8823.5s)]
*  And I think that, like I said before, [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8825.62s)]
*  the moon missions were reconnaissance missions. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8827.62s)]
*  And did we get some stuff? [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8829.82s)]
*  Oh, we got some stuff. [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8831.14s)]
*  What's one object that was found that didn't belong? [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8832.82s)]
*  They didn't, they don't tell you. [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8834.619999999999s)]
*  Oh, they're not gonna tell you. [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8836.18s)]
*  But what they did do, [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8837.34s)]
*  they put, there's two things they did. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8838.66s)]
*  One is they put an array of receiving dishes [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8840.699999999999s)]
*  and sending dishes on the moon. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8844.9s)]
*  And they transmit almost daily from earth there via laser. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8847.1s)]
*  What data are they sending? [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8850.3s)]
*  Who are they talking to? [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8851.619999999999s)]
*  Why are they sending data back and forth to the moon daily? [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8852.779999999999s)]
*  The next thing is the USGS.gov did a radar scan [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8855.74s)]
*  of the moon using the Arecibo dish, [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8861.14s)]
*  which now is broken. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8863.78s)]
*  Unfortunately, we got a lot of good data from that dish. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8865.38s)]
*  But the Arecibo dish, before it broke, [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8867.58s)]
*  it took ground penetrating radar scans of the moon. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8869.82s)]
*  And with those images from USGS.gov, [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8873.699999999999s)]
*  you can clearly see 30 meters beneath the moon surface. [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8876.42s)]
*  And you see what looked like beams, [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8879.14s)]
*  structures beneath the surface of the moon. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8880.98s)]
*  Could that be why all those craters are the same depth [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8885.18s)]
*  and they don't really go much deeper? [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8887.58s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8889.22s)]
*  Why it rang like a bell when they dropped the capsule on it? [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8891.06s)]
*  It's possible. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8896.3s)]
*  And in the ancient text, [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8898.539999999999s)]
*  and Lil talks to his son about going on a trip to the moon [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8900.619999999999s)]
*  and they go away for a long, long time. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8904.98s)]
*  And they had to wear their eagle's mask [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8907.619999999999s)]
*  because the atmosphere was thin. [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8909.5s)]
*  That's in the Sumerian tablets. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8912.06s)]
*  How did they know that? [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8913.9s)]
*  And so it's pretty crazy stuff. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8916.099999999999s)]
*  In one battle, one of the families loses the battle [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8917.5s)]
*  and they're banished to live on the moon [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8920.539999999999s)]
*  in the ancient text. [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8923.419999999998s)]
*  Any truth to it? [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8924.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8925.419999999998s)]
*  That's just what it says. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8926.24s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8928.74s)]
*  Okay, last thing I'm curious about. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8929.939999999999s)]
*  What's going on in the ocean? [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8931.66s)]
*  Oh man, the ocean is like the most unexplored place [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8933.619999999999s)]
*  in the universe for us, at least as humans. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8937.3s)]
*  There's a lot of things going on underneath the ocean. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8939.66s)]
*  These, if you ever fly across the Atlantic [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8942.74s)]
*  to like Qatar or something like that or Dubai, [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8947.94s)]
*  if you can take Qatar Airways, [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8952.14s)]
*  they have that screen that shows you the scan of the ocean [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8955.54s)]
*  as you're flying over it. [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8958.94s)]
*  Just look at that for a few hours. [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8960.48s)]
*  You'll start seeing things. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8963.06s)]
*  You'll start seeing what looks like remnants of structures [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8965.26s)]
*  underneath the water, which is pretty crazy [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8968.56s)]
*  because it's like a scan. [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8971.98s)]
*  So you're seeing what's down there, [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8973.02s)]
*  even if it's dark outside, [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8974.22s)]
*  you can still see what's down there. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8975.46s)]
*  And some of those things look like remnants [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8977.4s)]
*  of ancient structures that have been destroyed [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8979.3s)]
*  or flooded over or whatever. [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8982.14s)]
*  But underneath the ocean, [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8985.06s)]
*  it's one of the greatest places to hide [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8987.18s)]
*  if you're an advanced civilization [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8989.42s)]
*  because nobody's doing any real research down there. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8990.66s)]
*  And matter of fact, when I saw that UFO when I was a kid, [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8993.859999999999s)]
*  I told two of my friends what I saw and we talked about it. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=8996.66s)]
*  And they were saying, maybe it came from the ocean. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9001.1s)]
*  I was like, yeah, maybe it's from the ocean. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9003.78s)]
*  Now you gotta remember in 1977, [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9005.7s)]
*  we didn't have UFOs on TV. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9007.98s)]
*  We didn't have all these crazy cartoons talking about space. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9009.62s)]
*  The spaciest thing we had was the Jetsons. [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9014.7s)]
*  That was it. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9018.74s)]
*  And that was more like fantasy to us. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9019.86s)]
*  We had the Flintstones and Tom and Jerry, Mickey Mouse, [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9021.7s)]
*  things like that. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9026.18s)]
*  The Thundercats, which was pretty amazing [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9027.82s)]
*  because they were from the Pleiades. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9029.52s)]
*  But yeah, they were. [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9031.52s)]
*  Yeah, they were Lerans and Syrians [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9033.68s)]
*  from the Pleiadian star system, the Thundercats. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9035.800000000001s)]
*  I learned that later on going back to research it. [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9039.16s)]
*  So pretty crazy, but we weren't getting programmed [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9042.12s)]
*  about aliens and UFOs. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9045.44s)]
*  So we just had to think about where these things could be [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9047.32s)]
*  or where they came from. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9050.16s)]
*  And we thought maybe the ocean. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9051.16s)]
*  But I think that under the ocean, [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9053.0s)]
*  you'll find a lot of bases there, [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9054.2s)]
*  whether it be alien or ours, I'm not sure. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9056.18s)]
*  But I think that we will find the best place to hide [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9058.08s)]
*  on this planet is the ocean. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9060.92s)]
*  What about Antarctica? [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9062.36s)]
*  Antarctica is crazy. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9063.88s)]
*  First of all, Antarctica wasn't in that location. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9064.96s)]
*  It was in a more hospitable location. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9068.12s)]
*  Why, how do we know this? [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9070.16s)]
*  The animals are coming up out of the melting ice. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9071.76s)]
*  And so they take them to do autopsies on them [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9075.12s)]
*  and they have undigested food in their throats [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9077.72s)]
*  and their stomachs. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9079.84s)]
*  So what does that tell you? [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9081.039999999999s)]
*  They were flash frozen. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9082.5s)]
*  So now we're talking about tectonic plate slippage. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9084.44s)]
*  We're talking about a huge continent slipping [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9087.48s)]
*  and moving into a different position, [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9091.52s)]
*  probably within hours, not even days, [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9093.92s)]
*  and creating a global flood. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9097.64s)]
*  And when that water washes across that land [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9099.32s)]
*  with that cold air and that wind, [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9102.76s)]
*  everything is frozen very rapidly. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9104.72s)]
*  So this is why those animals have undigested food [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9106.88s)]
*  because they were frozen extremely fast. [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9109.88s)]
*  And the Antarctica was in a more hospitable location. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9113.08s)]
*  Now there's a giant hole down there, about 30 meters wide. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9118.06s)]
*  This hole is visible from Google Earth. [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9121.82s)]
*  And when you look at that hole, that 30 meter wide opening, [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9124.82s)]
*  you see all the bases from the biggest countries [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9127.7s)]
*  around earth are there in this research area. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9130.78s)]
*  And they're all working in collaboration, no war zone. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9133.5s)]
*  And so no war zone. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9137.300000000001s)]
*  There's one other area down there though, [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9138.9s)]
*  one other research base that makes you scratch your head, [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9140.62s)]
*  the Rockefeller Foundation is there. [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9143.300000000001s)]
*  So they have a research base down there as well. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9145.9s)]
*  I think it's right next to Germany. [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9148.18s)]
*  And so we have a guy on our TV network named Brad Olson. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9150.5s)]
*  He went down there and he got on land [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9155.14s)]
*  and allowed to get off the boat and come on land. [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9157.82s)]
*  And it's on a TV series called The Secrets of Antarctica [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9161.859999999999s)]
*  that we have on our TV network. [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9165.94s)]
*  But yeah, it's crazy. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9167.619999999999s)]
*  Now Buzz Aldrin went down there. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9169.66s)]
*  This is when the presidents and all the famous people [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9172.46s)]
*  were going down there at one point. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9174.3s)]
*  And he saw all the leaders of the world [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9176.18s)]
*  were going down there. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9177.02s)]
*  He got invited to go down there. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9177.86s)]
*  He hopped on Twitter and said, [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9179.18s)]
*  the people that they're meeting with were facing the most, [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9181.5s)]
*  he said, we're facing the most ultimate evil. [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9184.140000000001s)]
*  We're facing the ultimate evil. [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9185.94s)]
*  And then the tweet got deleted about four or five hours later, [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9188.460000000001s)]
*  but everybody had screenshotted it. [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9190.86s)]
*  That's too late. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9192.380000000001s)]
*  And once you get it on Twitter, you know how that is. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9193.220000000001s)]
*  And then they flew him out of there [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9195.820000000002s)]
*  and said he was getting sick. [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9197.300000000001s)]
*  He was coming down with some kind of cold or something. [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9198.26s)]
*  He wasn't sick. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9200.54s)]
*  Whoever they were meeting in that hole, [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9201.980000000001s)]
*  he didn't like what he saw. [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9203.94s)]
*  Now to add to that, [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9206.380000000001s)]
*  I went to do some training for remote viewing [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9207.740000000002s)]
*  with Major Ed Dames. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9211.900000000001s)]
*  He's on, you can look him up on Wikipedia. [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9213.42s)]
*  He was the head at one point [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9216.1s)]
*  of the CIA remote viewing program, right? [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9216.94s)]
*  Project Stargate. [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9221.02s)]
*  And so I was trained by him for two days, [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9222.54s)]
*  total of about probably 16 hours, [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9225.62s)]
*  one year, the next year, about another 10 hours. [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9227.300000000001s)]
*  But when our conversations after class, [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9229.78s)]
*  he told me that there's people that live there, [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9232.58s)]
*  not from Earth, that can come and go as they please. [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9236.58s)]
*  And there's nothing we can do to stop them. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9240.42s)]
*  That's what Major Ed Dames told me. [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9243.02s)]
*  Were you able to remote view? [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9246.66s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I was. [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9248.14s)]
*  The reason why I did the remote viewing [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9249.5s)]
*  is because I actually took a test that was sent to me. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9250.74s)]
*  Wait, what is remote viewing? [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9252.86s)]
*  That's when you send your mind outside of space and time [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9254.18s)]
*  to look for a target anywhere. [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9256.9s)]
*  So let's say you have a target for me. [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9259.1s)]
*  Explain that again. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9261.1s)]
*  There's like Stranger Things. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9262.300000000001s)]
*  Stranger Things is like an example of remote viewing. [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9263.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's a whole process you have to go through. [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9265.980000000001s)]
*  It took it to take hours. [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9268.300000000001s)]
*  But let's say you have a, [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9269.7s)]
*  let's say you're my director and you've got a target [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9271.220000000001s)]
*  that you want me to bring back intel on. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9274.5s)]
*  The military, the CIA used this in real time. [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9276.980000000001s)]
*  So you will, let's say it's a target, [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9279.74s)]
*  let's say it's a file inside of a cabinet [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9282.300000000001s)]
*  inside of a desk in Russia. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9284.060000000001s)]
*  You will attribute consciously a random number [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9286.220000000001s)]
*  that's on this random number generator [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9289.82s)]
*  to that file. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9292.5s)]
*  You'll get the number and you will sync it [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9293.34s)]
*  by thinking about this number is attached to this file [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9296.539999999999s)]
*  that we need to see what's in it. [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9298.94s)]
*  You will then give me, the remote viewer, the number. [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9301.1s)]
*  That's it. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9304.78s)]
*  That's all I get. [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9305.619999999999s)]
*  And from that, there's a process you go through. [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9307.22s)]
*  The first thing is you get to control your breathing. [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9310.02s)]
*  And the second thing is you have to create something [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9313.58s)]
*  called an idiom, which is a scribble on a piece of paper. [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9315.34s)]
*  From there, you go into this whole process [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9318.539999999999s)]
*  step by step by step of drawing [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9320.42s)]
*  what the target's bringing you. [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9323.9s)]
*  So you never physically go there, you send your mind there. [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9325.9s)]
*  And the US military and even the Russian government [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9328.78s)]
*  have used this for decades. [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9331.62s)]
*  The same technique. [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9333.66s)]
*  The lady I had the past life regression, [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9334.62s)]
*  she told me about that. [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9336.5s)]
*  She's like, certain colleagues of hers get used by the CIA [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9337.34s)]
*  to find assets and they do it telepathically. [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9341.58s)]
*  They do it, they do it all the time. [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9344.62s)]
*  I'm so confused. [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9346.82s)]
*  How? [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9347.66s)]
*  This is nuts. [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9348.98s)]
*  I'll tell you what, I have a whole four hour class [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9350.7s)]
*  I taught on this. [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9353.66s)]
*  I will send you a link to watch it for free. [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9354.74s)]
*  I'll send you the whole link, you guys can download it, [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9357.34s)]
*  watch it and check it out. [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9359.060000000001s)]
*  It's a four hour class and you can then duplicate [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9360.380000000001s)]
*  the processes that I teach in that show, in that workshop. [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9362.86s)]
*  You can duplicate it for yourself. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2UNMoAK7A&t=9366.060000000001s)]
