# Dax Shepard's Date with McConaughey, Best Fight Stories, & How to be a Man
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [September 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU)
*  We met, you were with McConaughey. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=0.0s)]
*  Were you as excited to meet him as I was? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2.0s)]
*  I don't really know him, but I was in Austin, and then you and I are DMing. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4.0s)]
*  And then lo and behold, you're performing while I'm in Austin. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=8.0s)]
*  So then I hit you up and I'm like, I want to come see your show. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=11.0s)]
*  You're like, great, how many tickets? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=13.0s)]
*  I'm like, bro, I think it's just me. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=15.0s)]
*  You're like, I was so embarrassed. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=16.0s)]
*  Then I don't know why, I was like, I'm gonna fucking ask Matthew McConaughey. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=18.0s)]
*  He lives in Austin, and I invite him to your show. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=22.0s)]
*  He doesn't know what I'm inviting him to. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=25.0s)]
*  It was basically a blind date with McConaughey. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=26.0s)]
*  And then he was like, where are you staying? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=29.0s)]
*  You're at Four Seasons, I'll be there at 7 o'clock, pick you up. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=31.0s)]
*  I'll be in the White Lincoln Navigator, look for me. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=33.0s)]
*  So I'm like, now he's picking me up. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=35.0s)]
*  I come down into the lobby of the Four Seasons and I walk out, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=37.0s)]
*  and sure enough, there's a White Lincoln Navigator. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=41.0s)]
*  And he's outside, playing against Kyle. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=43.0s)]
*  He's talking about who's coming through here. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=45.0s)]
*  Okay, we go sorority with McConaughey, we got the moms here. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=47.0s)]
*  He's holding the cord. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=50.0s)]
*  Totally living up to my dream of what he is. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=52.0s)]
*  We get in the car, we're on the way there. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=54.0s)]
*  He goes, I'm excited to go here, you know. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=56.0s)]
*  He goes, I'm on the Serena we're going to. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=58.0s)]
*  I'm bad. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=60.0s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm not as bad. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=61.0s)]
*  We get there, now we're just watching stand-up. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=63.0s)]
*  We can't really talk. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=65.0s)]
*  So now we're just sitting next to each other. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=66.0s)]
*  We don't really know each other. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=68.0s)]
*  But he goes, you probably want to say hi to your buddy. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=69.0s)]
*  Should we go backstage? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=71.0s)]
*  You just start interviewing him. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=72.0s)]
*  What are your political aspirations? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=73.0s)]
*  So we're leaving there, and I'm like, that was a lot of fun. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=75.0s)]
*  Also, we didn't really connect. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=80.0s)]
*  There was no magic moment. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=83.0s)]
*  It's a little bittersweet. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=84.0s)]
*  We're leaving. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=85.0s)]
*  We're walking in the car, and all of a sudden he goes. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=86.0s)]
*  You do this really well. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=90.0s)]
*  You're a great interviewer. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=91.0s)]
*  But this is something specifically I think you do really well. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=92.0s)]
*  Is you make the guests so comfortable when you ask the hard questions. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=94.0s)]
*  And the question was, what does it feel like when your movie bombs? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=99.0s)]
*  But the way you set it up was there's no, he wasn't defensive. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=103.0s)]
*  It was like genuine curiosity. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=109.0s)]
*  It wasn't like, I got you. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=110.0s)]
*  Well, I also can come from the place of, I've had a ton of stinkers. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=112.0s)]
*  I've had some hot bombs. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=115.0s)]
*  I didn't want to bring it up. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=117.0s)]
*  Or maybe that's what I did. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=119.0s)]
*  Dax me. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=122.0s)]
*  How are we going to bring that up? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=126.0s)]
*  Let's start with your bombs. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=127.0s)]
*  It's a very, very unique experience to travel around the country, go on talk shows, tell everybody about this movie. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=130.0s)]
*  Like basically tell the world, hey, I've put my heart into this thing. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=140.0s)]
*  And then Friday, you know, if that was a complete waste of time and then it's very public. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=144.0s)]
*  Like the people I've like interviewed that I've related most to as people have run for public office and then they lose the election. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=149.0s)]
*  And they walk around their city and everyone's like, oh, hey, we should go on your way. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=156.0s)]
*  You just you feel like you're wearing a sign that says I lost everywhere you go. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=162.0s)]
*  And by the way, no one gives a fuck. No one. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=167.0s)]
*  No, no. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=169.0s)]
*  Move on. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=170.0s)]
*  People see if Americans see I have a very specific example of how delusional I was. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=171.0s)]
*  I went on Conan O'Brien and I had to go on Monday after the movie always opened. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=178.0s)]
*  Pro tip. Don't ever schedule that because you don't know how it's going to go. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=183.0s)]
*  The whole weekend, I'm like, oh, my God, I'm never going to work again. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=189.0s)]
*  And then I'm like, and I go on Monday and act like this. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=192.0s)]
*  Everything's great for chips, which I had written and directed. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=195.0s)]
*  I went on to Conan and I had a shirt printed up that said number one comedy in America, which it was because there was no other companies out. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=199.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=209.0s)]
*  And so this was going to be my whole bit. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=210.0s)]
*  And I'm like, leading Conan into saying like, so number one movie comedy in America. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=212.0s)]
*  But it wasn't number one. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=218.0s)]
*  Was it? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=219.0s)]
*  And I'm like, no, no. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=220.0s)]
*  There was a couple there was a couple. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=221.0s)]
*  There was four or five others before. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=222.0s)]
*  You know, but I'm involved in this bit. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=224.0s)]
*  Involved in this bit. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=227.0s)]
*  And I'm like feeling the reaction of the audience and they're not getting it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=228.0s)]
*  And all of a sudden I realized like, oh, they don't know it bombed. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=233.0s)]
*  They just saw posters and commercials. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=237.0s)]
*  And so now you just look like you're bragging. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=240.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=242.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=243.0s)]
*  They think I'm seriously celebrating this accomplishment. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=244.0s)]
*  So I had to turn at one point and I go, gang, the movie didn't do so hot. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=248.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=253.0s)]
*  I had to perform and I had to let the audience in on what bit I was doing. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=254.0s)]
*  Did you feel them stop hating you at that moment? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=257.0s)]
*  It wasn't even that they ever hated me. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=260.0s)]
*  They were just confused because they of course didn't know it bombed. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=263.0s)]
*  And once I told them it bombed, then they loved it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=267.0s)]
*  Like, why am I wearing this shirt? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=269.0s)]
*  It was a big hit. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=270.0s)]
*  But I left that going like, oh, yeah, no, ain't no one's thinking about you. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=271.0s)]
*  They're not thinking about your movie. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=276.0s)]
*  They're not reading the trades. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=277.0s)]
*  They don't know when you ate shit. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=278.0s)]
*  And I was, you know, I have to look up very often. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=280.0s)]
*  If a movie did well, because I'm just I'll be curious and I have no clue. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=283.0s)]
*  It'd be movies that were popular. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=286.0s)]
*  But did I actually make money? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=288.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=289.0s)]
*  Well, and also there are movies that we are all certain are were huge hits and they absolutely weren't like Shawshank Redemption. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=290.0s)]
*  We all have seen Shawshank Redemption. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=297.0s)]
*  That movie made eight million dollars. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=299.0s)]
*  Idiocracy. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=301.0s)]
*  Idiocracy. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=302.0s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=303.0s)]
*  Not even millions. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=304.0s)]
*  What is that effect? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=306.0s)]
*  It's called where you. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=307.0s)]
*  Dunning Krueger. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=308.0s)]
*  Wait, is that what it is? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=309.0s)]
*  No, that's where dumb people talk the most. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=310.0s)]
*  I want to know about this effect. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=331.0s)]
*  What was the effect? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=332.0s)]
*  Strizing. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=333.0s)]
*  Oh, the Mandela effect. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=334.0s)]
*  Mandela effect. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=335.0s)]
*  Point is, we all remember Idiocracy and we know about it now to be this incredible film. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=336.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=341.0s)]
*  And there's predicting the future. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=342.0s)]
*  And every time anything happens in an election, they're like, I see, I see. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=343.0s)]
*  Look, they pointed out. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=346.0s)]
*  And then at the time, you were actually part of this. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=347.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=349.0s)]
*  Not to harp on movies that didn't do. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=350.0s)]
*  Oh, I'm happy to. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=352.0s)]
*  But this this Mike Judge brilliant film that you're part of, it didn't do well. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=353.0s)]
*  But I think we remember it as this sensational success. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=359.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=362.0s)]
*  In fact, it only came out in, I want to say, like 600 theaters. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=363.0s)]
*  And that was because I think contractually, Mike Judge, he was guaranteed they had to [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=368.0s)]
*  release it in some amount of theaters. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=373.0s)]
*  But even when they released it, if you called like Fandango back then, it sometimes it was [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=376.0s)]
*  listed as Untitled Mike Judge Project, which no one's ever tried to buy a ticket to Untitled [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=380.0s)]
*  Mike Judge Project. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=385.0s)]
*  Yeah, it wasn't even labeled correctly. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=386.0s)]
*  Mike Judge is Beavis and Butthead. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=388.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=390.0s)]
*  And even probably with similar trajectory, Office Space. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=391.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=396.0s)]
*  Which that movie again, we all have seen multiple times and it made 10 million bucks. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=397.0s)]
*  Shawshank Bombed? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=402.0s)]
*  Yeah, one of the greatest movies in history. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=403.0s)]
*  That's the one that throws me off. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=405.0s)]
*  The other ones I remember hearing about from word of mouth and being like, oh, that movie's [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=406.0s)]
*  good. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=409.0s)]
*  But Shawshank, I grew up, I was like eight when it came out and I couldn't believe that [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=410.0s)]
*  didn't that wasn't a hit. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=413.0s)]
*  Swingers. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=415.0s)]
*  Swingers I knew also because. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=416.0s)]
*  I'm older than you guys, so I'm going to hit the wall on some of these. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=418.0s)]
*  No, Swingers. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=422.0s)]
*  Sharky's Machine, right? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=423.0s)]
*  You guys remember Sharky? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=424.0s)]
*  I apparently Fight Club bombed at the box office. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=425.0s)]
*  No. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=428.0s)]
*  Wow, that blows my mind. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=429.0s)]
*  This is from IndieWire.com. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=430.0s)]
*  Yeah, see, I used to be an encyclopedia about this because I am so obsessed with money. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=431.0s)]
*  It wasn't a bomb, but considering it was Pitt and Edward Norton and Fincher, I don't [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=438.0s)]
*  think it hit 100 million. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=443.0s)]
*  So I think it like what they thought it was going to be. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=444.0s)]
*  Underperform. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=446.0s)]
*  It opened at 11 million, tapping out at 37 million at the US box office. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=447.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a bummer. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=450.0s)]
*  Fox spent 65 million on the film. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=451.0s)]
*  Sounds like a bomb. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=453.0s)]
*  It happens. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=454.0s)]
*  Do you think movies are done? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=455.0s)]
*  In the theater? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=456.0s)]
*  I had thought. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=457.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, by the way, a movie out now. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=458.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=459.0s)]
*  I think it. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=460.0s)]
*  It's not the Fast Weavers. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=461.0s)]
*  No, I'm quite bullish on. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=462.0s)]
*  I would have thought that until I saw Maverick. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=463.0s)]
*  And then something interesting happened with Chip. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=474.0s)]
*  So you all saw Maverick, Top Gun 2. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=477.0s)]
*  I saw it three times at IMAX and I was like, oh, that's right. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=480.0s)]
*  We love this. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=485.0s)]
*  We love having fun. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=486.0s)]
*  We love action. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=488.0s)]
*  The stuff that maybe shouldn't work, works so great. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=489.0s)]
*  Like she leaves the door open. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=492.0s)]
*  It's open. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=494.0s)]
*  You're like, get in there, Maverick. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=495.0s)]
*  That movie was reminded us so much of how fun. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=498.0s)]
*  She was naughty when she did that, didn't she? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=502.0s)]
*  That girl was like, leave this door open. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=504.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=507.0s)]
*  That movie was so fun and I think reminded everyone of how fun it is to go to a movie [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=508.0s)]
*  that's fantastic that weirdly, Chip's like a month or two after that, my best friend [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=514.0s)]
*  was one of the producers and he called me and he's like, you got to go on Netflix. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=521.0s)]
*  Chip somehow is in the top 10 of movies streaming right now. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=524.0s)]
*  I'm like, that's so weird. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=528.0s)]
*  Why is that happening? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=529.0s)]
*  And then it just slowly climbed for like a month all the way up to two. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=530.0s)]
*  He just kept calling me every day like, you're not going to believe it. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=535.0s)]
*  We're at three. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=538.0s)]
*  Now mind you, this is five years after the movie came out. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=539.0s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=542.0s)]
*  And my only explanation is like, you saw Maverick. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=543.0s)]
*  You're like, that's right. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=546.0s)]
*  I like the fucking party. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=547.0s)]
*  I want some action. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=548.0s)]
*  I want comedy. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=549.0s)]
*  And then all of a sudden that's what that movie was. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=550.0s)]
*  It was sitting right there. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=553.0s)]
*  So it had a little second life and I think kind of driven by Maverick. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=554.0s)]
*  So I knew your success on the pod. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=559.0s)]
*  I imagine people are going back and seeing all the things you're in as they get more [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=561.0s)]
*  invested in your life. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=565.0s)]
*  I wonder. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=566.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=567.0s)]
*  I don't know if that has an impact. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=568.0s)]
*  I don't know if you wrote that movie, directed that movie. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=569.0s)]
*  Like that's a, if there's a Dax movie I want to watch that Dax drove, that's the one. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=572.0s)]
*  Well, I do think if you do listen to the podcast and you watch that movie and go, oh, it's [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=576.0s)]
*  all in there. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=581.0s)]
*  Same. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=582.0s)]
*  I made another movie called hit and run with my wife. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=583.0s)]
*  Car chase. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=585.0s)]
*  This isn't going to work out. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=586.0s)]
*  Are you left handed or right handed? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=587.0s)]
*  Are you left handed or right handed? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=588.0s)]
*  I'm right handed. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=589.0s)]
*  Are you left handed? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=590.0s)]
*  I'm left. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=591.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=592.0s)]
*  We were, if we were eating dinner. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=593.0s)]
*  Do you want a switch? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=594.0s)]
*  No, but just this is going to be a thing. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=595.0s)]
*  Okay, whatever. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=596.0s)]
*  Also, what a boat you have. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=597.0s)]
*  What size is that? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=598.0s)]
*  Keep talking. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=599.0s)]
*  Is that a 13? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=600.0s)]
*  He's really good. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=601.0s)]
*  Is that a 13? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=602.0s)]
*  I'm so buttered up. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=603.0s)]
*  I know he's going to destroy me. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=604.0s)]
*  Drop the hammer. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=605.0s)]
*  How many inches is your penis? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=606.0s)]
*  Okay, you win. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=607.0s)]
*  All right, go. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=608.0s)]
*  I can't remember what I was saying. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=609.0s)]
*  Oh, just, yes. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=612.0s)]
*  You did hit and run with your wife or something. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=613.0s)]
*  Yes, I did. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=616.0s)]
*  Yes, I did. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=617.0s)]
*  And both, both just hit and run. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=618.0s)]
*  Have a lot of like emotional chat in them. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=621.0s)]
*  There's a lot of like, there's addiction, there's like vulnerability, all this shit [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=626.0s)]
*  that I think people that listen to the podcast like is in these action comedies. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=630.0s)]
*  So I think it is fun if you started maybe in the podcast and did find your way to those [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=635.0s)]
*  movies. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=639.0s)]
*  But I don't know, because it's a different genre and medium. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=640.0s)]
*  I don't know if it transfers. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=645.0s)]
*  You would, you could answer that as good as anyone. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=646.0s)]
*  I think IP works still. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=649.0s)]
*  Chips is IP. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=652.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=653.0s)]
*  Maverick is IP. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=654.0s)]
*  But Chips was not the IP we thought it was. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=655.0s)]
*  That's the big mistake we. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=658.0s)]
*  Meaning there's still some nostalgia baked in. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=659.0s)]
*  There's a curiosity. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=661.0s)]
*  We thought so. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=662.0s)]
*  And no. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=663.0s)]
*  Well, if I learned a single lesson from that movie, it was while we're recruiting, because [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=664.0s)]
*  before you ever released the movie of all these test screenings and they just hand out [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=668.0s)]
*  flyers at malls like come see this movie, here's the title, you don't know anything [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=673.0s)]
*  about it and people show up and they watch it. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=676.0s)]
*  And you have a rate, you know how many flyers you handed out versus how many said yes. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=678.0s)]
*  And so for Hit and Run, the number was, we had a much higher conversion rate. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=684.0s)]
*  Chips we have in a very low conversion rate. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=688.0s)]
*  And then when they would ask people, people were like, it's a movie about, it's about [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=690.0s)]
*  potato chips. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=694.0s)]
*  Like it was very literal to them. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=695.0s)]
*  It was like, I'm not going to see a movie about chips. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=697.0s)]
*  Your test market had no clue what the. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=700.0s)]
*  We had found out like 90 plus percent of the people had no idea about the TV show chips. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=701.0s)]
*  At that point, we should have just changed the movie title to like California Highway [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=707.0s)]
*  Patrol. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=711.0s)]
*  You would at least know it was a cop movie. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=712.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=713.0s)]
*  So yeah, that IP in our case. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=714.0s)]
*  Didn't work. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=717.0s)]
*  It wasn't as strong. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=718.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=719.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=720.0s)]
*  But I think that can work now, especially with if you're doing like the major box office [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=721.0s)]
*  thing. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=723.0s)]
*  I think people go off for Batman, go for Superman, maybe they'll go out for like Ghostbusters. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=724.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=727.0s)]
*  But the new movie that you don't really know anything about, but it could be an amazing [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=728.0s)]
*  story. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=733.0s)]
*  I think that those will probably be more successful streaming where like the barrier to entry [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=734.0s)]
*  is exactly buried. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=738.0s)]
*  Entry is a term I was going to use. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=739.0s)]
*  That's probably why chips takes off on Netflix. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=740.0s)]
*  Somebody just text their friend. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=741.0s)]

*  Baby sitter, put on clothes. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=745.0s)]
*  Or even if like if you're in the motorsports world, which my Instagram is is mostly cars [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=746.0s)]
*  and motorcycles is my algorithm. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=756.0s)]

*  Now it's just like different recaps on World War Two that I never considered. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=771.0s)]
*  Is that what your feed is? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=778.0s)]
*  My Twitter feed. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=780.0s)]
*  I didn't see it this way. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=781.0s)]
*  Thanks Tucker Carlson. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=784.0s)]
*  That's a scary thing. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=787.0s)]
*  So there are lines from those movies chips, right? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=791.0s)]
*  Like I fail everything in the police academy, but I'm great on a motorcycle. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=794.0s)]
*  And she says, well, you can ride a motorcycle. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=799.0s)]
*  And I say, yes, ma'am, like a motherfucker. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=801.0s)]
*  And if you're into motorcycles, that became like a thing. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=803.0s)]
*  So yeah, maybe someone saw that clip and then they went and checked out the movie. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=805.0s)]
*  I guess it can happen a lot of ways. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=809.0s)]
*  I agree. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=811.0s)]

*  Let's get back to the show. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=923.0s)]
*  And look what it took you to get back into the movie theater, Maverick, where you had [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=925.0s)]
*  to be in the top crews in the jet. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=929.0s)]
*  And yeah, the remake or not the remake, but the what's it called? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=932.0s)]
*  The sequel to one of the most fun movies ever. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=936.0s)]
*  Although, have any of you gone back to watch the original post Maverick? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=939.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=943.0s)]
*  Okay, because my 11 year old, I took her, we saw it twice together. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=944.0s)]
*  And so I was like, well, shit, now we got to go back to the original. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=947.0s)]
*  And when we're watching the original, I was like, it's very good. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=950.0s)]
*  It's not as good as I remember. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=952.0s)]
*  Maverick is much better. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=954.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=956.0s)]
*  I know that might be sacrilegious to people, but I think if you go back and you watch it, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=957.0s)]
*  you're like, yeah, it's really good. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=961.0s)]

*  Exactly. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=982.0s)]

*  We could not, some made it out for sure, but they were rounding up any intellectuals, any [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1052.0s)]
*  business people. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1057.0s)]
*  What were they teaching? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1058.0s)]
*  Presumably laissez-faire, Adam Marx capitalism. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1060.0s)]
*  Gotta go. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1065.0s)]
*  Gotta go. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1066.0s)]
*  Yeah, can't. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1067.0s)]
*  There's no room for Pol Pot and them. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1068.0s)]
*  Sounds like some Robert Barron bullshit to me. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1071.0s)]
*  Stalin, you could get behind maybe Stalin. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1073.0s)]
*  We wouldn't want that one. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1075.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1076.0s)]
*  I'm just adding some things to the Nazi Germany. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1077.0s)]
*  What was Joseph doing? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1080.0s)]
*  What was he up to? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1081.0s)]
*  You know, famine. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1082.0s)]
*  Well, they say that he killed, that he has killed, he killed the most amount of people [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1083.0s)]
*  of anyone to ever live on planet Earth. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1088.0s)]
*  No, that's Leopold. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1090.0s)]
*  Hit me with that data. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1092.0s)]
*  Congo, 25 million people. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1094.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1096.0s)]
*  That was the most? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1097.0s)]
*  Stalin's estimates are between like 20 and 60 million. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1098.0s)]
*  That he personally killed or died under his watch, because I know that 25 million. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1101.0s)]
*  Famine. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1105.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1106.0s)]
*  Which he caused. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1107.0s)]
*  He also sent an insane amount of people out to Siberia. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1108.0s)]
*  He created the Gulag system. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1112.0s)]
*  He is, he was. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1114.0s)]
*  He's a bad guy. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1115.0s)]
*  Yeah, he kind of flies under the radar. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1116.0s)]
*  Really lets you know, Hitler wasn't that bad. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1118.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1119.0s)]
*  You think about it. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1120.0s)]
*  Take away. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1121.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1122.0s)]
*  I think my Twitter is the rebrand for Hitler on Twitter right now. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1123.0s)]
*  I gotta stay off Twitter. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1126.0s)]
*  This isn't bad, but thank you for proposing. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1128.0s)]
*  Stalin's also too handsome when he's young. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1129.0s)]
*  He had a nice jaw, right? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1131.0s)]
*  This is a prop. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1132.0s)]
*  Let's see it. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1133.0s)]
*  Oh, no, that motherfucker can get it. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1134.0s)]
*  He created Telegram. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1136.0s)]
*  I didn't know he ever looked that good, by the way. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1137.0s)]
*  It's unreal. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1141.0s)]
*  He got the Palestinian flag on. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1142.0s)]
*  I mean, this guy, there's no way you created this. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1144.0s)]
*  He's like a Timothy Chalamet of the 1930s. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1146.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1149.0s)]
*  One of the greatest murderers ever to live. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1150.0s)]
*  Yeah, gorgeous. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1152.0s)]
*  Well, some of these murders are very attractive, like Ted Bundy. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1153.0s)]
*  Yeah, Ted Bundy was kind of a piece. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1155.0s)]
*  I didn't see it with Ted Bundy, to be honest with you. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1157.0s)]
*  I see it with Stalin. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1159.0s)]
*  I see it with Stalin. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1160.0s)]
*  I see it with Stalin. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1162.0s)]
*  I get it. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1163.0s)]
*  He wasn't your type. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1164.0s)]
*  Ted Bundy got my lane. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1165.0s)]
*  Who was good in history? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1167.0s)]
*  Can we go over that? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1168.0s)]
*  I could be Wude. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1169.0s)]
*  Who was good? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1170.0s)]
*  Dax? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1171.0s)]
*  Oh, we've had a lot of good folks. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1172.0s)]
*  Give me top three good. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1175.0s)]
*  Just leaders or leaders? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1178.0s)]
*  Scientists? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1181.0s)]
*  Leaders. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1182.0s)]
*  No, they have to be leaders because leaders are going to make the decisions. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1183.0s)]
*  Teddy Roosevelt. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1186.0s)]
*  Teddy. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1187.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1188.0s)]
*  Took the bullet. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1189.0s)]
*  Teddy. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1190.0s)]
*  Sickly boy. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1191.0s)]
*  Got strong on a ranch. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1192.0s)]
*  Came back and reinvented himself. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1195.0s)]
*  Finished the Panama Canal. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1197.0s)]
*  It was impossible to do. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1199.0s)]
*  Kind of few people died in that one, right? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1200.0s)]
*  Thousands of people died. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1203.0s)]
*  Compared to Stalin, it doesn't seem that bad. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1204.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1207.0s)]
*  The Panamanians. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1208.0s)]
*  Everyone took a run at that and everyone quit. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1209.0s)]
*  And then Teddy's like, we're finishing this thing. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1211.0s)]
*  I don't know how many Americans have died of yellow fever. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1213.0s)]
*  Oh, was it Americans that died or the Panamanians? [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1215.0s)]
*  Well, first there was, I happened to have read The Path Between Two Seas, the McCullough [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1218.0s)]
*  book about this. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1223.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1225.0s)]
*  First was the guy who had dug the Suez Canal. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1226.0s)]
*  He was everyone's favorite. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1228.0s)]
*  He linked the East and Europe. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1230.0s)]
*  So he's the best digger in the world. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1233.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1235.0s)]
*  And I'm like, we're going to send him over there. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1236.0s)]
*  That is tense, dude. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1237.0s)]
*  Don't use that term again. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1238.0s)]
*  Digger. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1239.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1240.0s)]
*  What happened? [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1241.0s)]
*  He's good at digging. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1242.0s)]
*  He's good. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1243.0s)]
*  Oh, gosh. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1244.0s)]
*  What are you doing right now? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1245.0s)]
*  I'm getting terrified. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1246.0s)]
*  This is, I inoculate myself to your canceling. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1247.0s)]
*  I wasn't a part of that conversation. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1250.0s)]
*  I was spraying Nicorette. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1254.0s)]
*  What did you say? [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1255.0s)]
*  He was sex. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1256.0s)]
*  Nicorette. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1257.0s)]
*  Sex. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1258.0s)]
*  Calm down. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1259.0s)]
*  Calm down. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1260.0s)]
*  I was like, this guy is about sobriety. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1261.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1266.0s)]
*  I think the news was French. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1267.0s)]
*  Anyways, there was like a corporation that was formed in Europe, tons of investors. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1269.0s)]
*  They send the guy over. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1274.0s)]
*  Everyone drops dead of yellow fever and typhoid fever and all this. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1275.6s)]
*  They can't do it. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1279.0s)]
*  The Atlantic and the Pacific are at two different heights. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1280.5s)]
*  They got to go through all this land in South America. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1282.48s)]
*  It's a disaster. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1284.84s)]
*  People die. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1285.84s)]
*  They pull out. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1286.84s)]
*  It gets resurrected by someone else. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1287.84s)]
*  Then ultimately Teddy Roosevelt was like, we're going to finish this thing and accomplish [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1289.14s)]
*  that. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1294.8600000000001s)]
*  It's like the most harrowing project maybe we've done. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1295.8600000000001s)]
*  So him, I would do two more, but I think I'm taking up too much time. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1298.74s)]
*  Martin Luther King Jr.? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1301.3400000000001s)]
*  No, who else? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1302.3400000000001s)]
*  Martin Luther King. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1303.3400000000001s)]
*  We like that a lot. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1304.3400000000001s)]
*  Jr. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1305.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but he's not in power. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1306.3400000000001s)]
*  I'm talking about like you're in positions of power. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1307.3400000000001s)]
*  Like actual politicians. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1309.5s)]
*  We're got Lincoln. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1310.5s)]
*  You like Lincoln? [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1311.5s)]
*  Of course I like Lincoln. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1312.5s)]
*  You know one that doesn't get a lot of credit, and this comes from having read a book about [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1313.5s)]
*  him too, is Ulysses S. Grant. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1316.26s)]
*  I heard this. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1318.14s)]
*  I heard his name kind of did him in disservice. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1319.14s)]
*  Well, he was an interesting dude because he was at the same time an absolute idiot and [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1322.3400000000001s)]
*  a genius. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1327.74s)]
*  So like he had fallen for every get rich quick scheme. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1328.74s)]
*  He was like a terrible businessman. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1332.66s)]
*  He had been great in maybe the Mexican American war or something, and then just had come home [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1334.42s)]
*  and lost a bunch of money and he was kind of a loser. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1340.26s)]
*  And then he gets called back up to do this and he has a great genius for military operations. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1342.5200000000002s)]
*  But I think that the thing we all we think of Abraham Lincoln, of course, as we should, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1348.6200000000001s)]
*  but really reformation was like the period that was so untenable. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1353.46s)]
*  So few people could have kept the country together post Civil War. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1357.8600000000001s)]
*  And he just did an impossible job of doing that. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1361.8200000000002s)]
*  And yeah, he probably doesn't get enough credit. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1364.3s)]
*  But then he left the White House and he again became insolvent and owed people money and [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1365.94s)]
*  he was supported by benefactors. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1369.78s)]
*  And yeah. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1371.8200000000002s)]
*  Well, is there no system for like presidents? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1373.22s)]
*  Like a public speaking service? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1377.1s)]
*  No, no, like, you know how they for NFL players, they give you a little something when you're [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1378.4199999999998s)]
*  when you're retired. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1382.1799999999998s)]
*  Oh, like the opposite of a signing bonus? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1383.1799999999998s)]
*  Is there no pension for presidents back then? [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1385.8999999999999s)]
*  I don't know if there was back then because the Civil War was the first time, you know, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1388.22s)]
*  the North started printing money. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1394.3799999999999s)]
*  We had a first central bank. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1396.26s)]
*  Like all this is new. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1397.58s)]
*  So I doubt there was a I don't even know that they paid presidents. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1398.8999999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure they didn't have security, which is insane. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1402.5400000000002s)]
*  What do you mean? They didn't have the secret service didn't come about until late in the [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1408.3000000000002s)]
*  game. We had a ton of presidents were shot for really. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1411.7s)]
*  We should get some get some guys over there. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1414.9s)]
*  Bros with guns around this person. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1416.5800000000002s)]
*  Interesting. Yeah. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1419.94s)]
*  Nineteen fifty eight federal law that provides lifetime benefits to former presidents way [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1420.98s)]
*  past Grant. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1425.66s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1427.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Fifty eight. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1428.18s)]
*  But he was like people did love him, though, so he was he was taken care of by a bunch [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1429.3799999999999s)]
*  of people. But he was embarrassed and humiliated regularly. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1433.82s)]
*  Yeah. Most powerful man in the land. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1438.78s)]
*  And now you're. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1440.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, God. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1441.1399999999999s)]
*  But if you want a guy to stand up on a boat while you're shooting at people and they're [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1443.1799999999998s)]
*  shooting at you and he's not going to sit down, he's going to keep yelling orders. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1447.06s)]
*  Grant's your guy. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1450.3s)]
*  Really? Oh, yeah. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1451.34s)]
*  What are the stories about Grant that he just every time he miraculously avoided getting [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1452.3s)]
*  shot when everyone else on the boat shot around him, he was always at the front lines. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1456.82s)]
*  He was not and fearless at that time. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1461.7s)]
*  Wait a minute. At that time, if you were the the head military commander, it was your [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1464.34s)]
*  responsibility to be at the front of the boat. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1467.62s)]
*  You know, most of them weren't. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1469.22s)]
*  But his his unique gift was like he was a guy who led by example and he convinced the [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1471.02s)]
*  guys around him. He did not have the best strategy, but he had the kind of relentless [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1476.4199999999998s)]
*  I'll go first to follow me. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1480.5s)]
*  He was he was an infectious leader. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1482.82s)]
*  He was the real dude. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1485.66s)]
*  OK. Yeah. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1486.8600000000001s)]
*  And then what about Sherman? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1487.8600000000001s)]
*  I wish I knew more about Sherman. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1489.38s)]
*  What he invaded Africa with tanks. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1490.9s)]
*  Well, I know that's part of war. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1493.1000000000001s)]
*  Oh, to come to Sherman. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1495.5800000000002s)]
*  This is during the Civil War as well. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1497.9s)]
*  Oh, I'm thinking of the Sherman tank. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1499.26s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1501.42s)]
*  Is that named after him? [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1503.0600000000002s)]
*  I don't know. Anyway, I've exceeded my historical knowledge. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1504.5400000000002s)]
*  Oh, the Civil War. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1509.5400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1510.3000000000002s)]
*  Are you a history guy? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1510.78s)]
*  Accidentally, I have this all works backwards from I'm an insomniac. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1512.8999999999999s)]
*  And over the many years of trying to figure out how to fall asleep, what I figured out [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1517.1799999999998s)]
*  as a book on tape for me is ideal. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1520.82s)]
*  But the book has to be boring enough. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1522.6999999999998s)]
*  Like I tried Keith Richards autobiography. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1525.3799999999999s)]
*  And you were up to it. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1527.5s)]
*  Oh, my God. Yeah. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1528.5s)]
*  I was like, oh, I will stay over the next six days until this is done. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1529.2199999999998s)]
*  So for me, these like dense historical books are perfect because I'm pretty interested [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1533.9399999999998s)]
*  in it. But then they lose me. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1538.9399999999998s)]
*  The fucking path between two seas, you guys, it's a thousand pages of damn or of construction [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1540.46s)]
*  and, you know, pylons and the bridge. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1546.7s)]
*  This the Brooklyn Bridge books. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1551.14s)]
*  Same thing, McCullough. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1552.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. You know, you're there's chapters and chapters about them being. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1553.7s)]
*  Oh, he got into that Carlin history podcast. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1557.3000000000002s)]
*  I forget what it's called. Oh, my God. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1559.7s)]
*  Yes. Hardcore, hardcore history. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1561.3000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I've heard him talk about that. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1563.38s)]
*  That motherfucker goes deep. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1564.54s)]
*  He'll do nine, ten hours, anything. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1565.98s)]
*  But your retention is pretty impressive. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1569.42s)]
*  Well, thank you. I credit dyslexia for that. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1572.3400000000001s)]
*  How so? Because when I was a kid, I didn't learn to read to like fifth grade. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1576.1000000000001s)]
*  I was in a learning disabled room with the other guy or the other gang. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1579.8600000000001s)]
*  And how am I going to be delicate about it? [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1583.46s)]
*  And then, well, there's I was I was one of a few people not wearing a helmet. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1586.3400000000001s)]
*  And it was very confusing to me because I was like on the playground. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1590.38s)]
*  I seem kind of smart. I'm chatting with dudes and I'm holding my own. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1595.3000000000002s)]
*  But I get in this classroom. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1599.18s)]
*  They're writing on the chalkboard and I'm like, I don't know what's going on. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1600.9s)]
*  And I had five years of that. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1604.54s)]
*  So the only thing I picked up was what I heard the teachers say. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1607.42s)]
*  Like if I was going to remember anything, it was going to have to come orally. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1612.14s)]
*  And so I think I do have a pretty high retention for things I hear. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1617.38s)]
*  I've noticed this quality in great interviewers and successful podcasters. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1622.02s)]
*  Rogan also is has incredible retention. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1627.7800000000002s)]
*  He does read something once or hear something once locked in forever. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1630.7800000000002s)]
*  And I imagine if you're talking to hundreds of people and you need to call on [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1634.5s)]
*  random pieces of information from your life or things you've read or books, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1638.3400000000001s)]
*  the more that you can actually call on, the more advantageous [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1642.46s)]
*  it's going to be in those situations. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1645.38s)]
*  Did you have any learning disability growing up? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1646.5s)]
*  Probably. Probably. Yeah. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1648.8600000000001s)]
*  You didn't do so hot in school or how did you do? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1650.7s)]
*  Oh, my God, I learned this about you today that you went to UCSB. Yeah. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1653.0600000000002s)]
*  That seems totally out of the realm of what I would have guessed. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1656.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. What did you guess? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1659.9s)]
*  Well, I would have thought an East Coast. You're very New York. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1661.66s)]
*  Yeah, I grew up here, born and raised here. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1664.22s)]
*  Yeah. Parents owned a dance studio. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1665.78s)]
*  Mom was a ballroom dancer. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1668.38s)]
*  But three time U.S. ballroom dancer. Was she hot? Yeah. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1669.98s)]
*  Did your buddies? [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1673.1000000000001s)]
*  Like a Scottish 11. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1674.0600000000002s)]
*  OK, so I know. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1676.26s)]
*  I know we don't need to say it, but I know what it means. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1677.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I don't need to offend anyone. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1680.38s)]
*  But I feel you. Yeah. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1682.8600000000001s)]
*  I'm from Michigan, so I got to do a lot of transference, too. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1684.5s)]
*  I'm trying to explain dudes at home what I'm looking at in California. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1689.02s)]
*  They don't understand. Yeah. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1692.74s)]
*  I got to exceed the 10. Yeah. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1693.38s)]
*  I got to go above 10. The roads are paved with gold. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1695.26s)]
*  Yeah. It's hard to explain. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1697.26s)]
*  What were we talking about? Oh, your mom. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1698.7s)]
*  She was hot, though. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1699.98s)]
*  Did your buddies? Beautiful. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1701.22s)]
*  Did my boys want to smash? No, she was older. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1703.14s)]
*  My mom was like when I was born, maybe like 35. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1705.14s)]
*  Now, some of them still do, actually. Yeah. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1707.18s)]
*  OK, because I imagine she's in crazy shape. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1708.94s)]
*  You still want to? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1711.7s)]
*  No, he was trying to get after it. 100%. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1713.02s)]
*  Yeah, he's a milkman. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1714.86s)]
*  And my mom had the milk. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1716.02s)]
*  Does that mean she was endowed? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1718.22s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1720.1s)]
*  Well, every mammal has milk, but I'm wondering, did she have big breasts? [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1721.58s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1725.22s)]
*  OK. Dogs. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1727.1399999999999s)]
*  My mom did. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1728.82s)]
*  My mom does still. Still. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1729.94s)]
*  And did you hate I hated going out with my own? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1732.82s)]
*  Smell of them. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1741.06s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1742.06s)]
*  I'm proud to say I don't know what they smell like. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1743.7s)]
*  But I did hate when I was like around nine, ten, and I'd go out with my mom [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1745.74s)]
*  and she'd wear like a tank top and random dudes. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1751.1399999999999s)]
*  I'd see some other side of random dudes like they're super helpful. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1753.8999999999999s)]
*  And now they're chatting with my mom. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1757.22s)]
*  And I remember hating that, like, oh, God, look at this fucking bozo. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1758.4199999999998s)]
*  Now he's going to come over and say something. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1761.78s)]
*  Did you have that going out with him? [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1763.6599999999999s)]
*  I had a lot of women flirt with my dad, I think. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1765.02s)]
*  Oh, really? Is he a stud? [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1767.78s)]
*  He's just really charismatic and like nice. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1768.86s)]
*  Charming guy. Charming. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1771.22s)]
*  But he's a what? Charming guy. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1772.46s)]
*  Oh, OK. Very charming. Charming guy. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1774.22s)]
*  Tall gentleman. Yeah. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1776.14s)]
*  Like maybe six foot, six, one. OK. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1777.5s)]
*  But like you're the most interesting person that he's ever spoken to. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1779.7s)]
*  Yeah. Like immediately. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1782.38s)]
*  That's what whatever you're doing. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1783.98s)]
*  It is he's authentically curious about it. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1785.38s)]
*  And you are the most interesting. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1788.0600000000002s)]
*  But you no doubt didn't mind that women were talking to your dad. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1789.5400000000002s)]
*  That's fine. If you're a young boy. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1794.8600000000001s)]
*  It's just couldn't help it. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1797.0200000000002s)]
*  I know what they're going to do. They're powerless. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1798.5s)]
*  What's his name? Larry. Larry. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1800.5s)]
*  Great name for him. Larry Schultz. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1802.38s)]
*  Separated at the point you started noticing this. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1804.34s)]
*  And if so, do you think that's why? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1806.1s)]
*  Yeah, I was on my probably second stepdad by this point. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1807.3s)]
*  Your mom must have been hot. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1811.26s)]
*  Yes, he's attractive. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1814.42s)]
*  To get to three. To get to three. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1815.98s)]
*  Oh, she didn't stop there. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1818.34s)]
*  I know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1819.82s)]
*  Before then, there's a dude currently trying to marry her, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1820.98s)]
*  which is good for her because she's 72. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1823.38s)]
*  Yeah. How did? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1826.18s)]
*  What's her appeal? No. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1828.1s)]
*  What do you think? She's so good. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1831.5s)]
*  How do you how does she so good? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1832.98s)]
*  Well, she's a very cool woman. She's a fucking gangster. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1834.46s)]
*  She like left my dad was a single mom, had all these terrible husbands, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1837.58s)]
*  built a business that was successful, built her own house. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1842.3s)]
*  She's like attractive and she's smart and she's a phenom, especially, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1846.9s)]
*  you know, she was three months pregnant at her senior prom with my brother. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1853.14s)]
*  Wow. You know, at 18 in the 70s. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1858.02s)]
*  And so the expectations for her versus what she went and did, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1861.82s)]
*  she's like a very impressive human being. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1865.06s)]
*  So I get why guys have fallen in love with her. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1867.3s)]
*  But I also think she suffered from something I see endlessly [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1870.6599999999999s)]
*  with like the very famous women I interview, which is like fucking good luck. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1874.3799999999999s)]
*  I feel terrible for him. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1879.06s)]
*  There's dudes are attracted to this shiny, incredible thing. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1880.74s)]
*  And then the second they're with that incredible, shiny thing, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1883.9399999999998s)]
*  they're threatened by it and they want to destroy it. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1887.1399999999999s)]
*  And so like whereas a dude gets famous and rich and his his his options [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1889.82s)]
*  just go like this for women, it just goes like this. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1894.3799999999999s)]
*  Like, you know, I hope you find a dude that's confident enough [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1897.4599999999998s)]
*  to let you be shiny and be the breadwinner and not be an asshole and try to destroy you. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1900.6999999999998s)]
*  And I think my mother on her own level suffered from that. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1905.06s)]
*  I think I was really like, oh, my God, this woman is a fucking baller. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1907.3799999999999s)]
*  Men sell for this so much in career success. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1909.86s)]
*  It's like I think of a woman was with a guy that was considered more beautiful than her. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1912.4199999999998s)]
*  It would really fuck with her because their self-worth is often put in looks. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1916.02s)]
*  You know what I mean? Well, I think it just kind of operates like that. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1919.5s)]
*  Like if my wife was making tons more money than me, I would feel threatened [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1922.34s)]
*  because I buy into that traditional model of what a man is. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1925.8999999999999s)]
*  I had that for sure. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1928.22s)]
*  So my wife for many years made a lot more money than me. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1929.74s)]
*  And I think I grew up with a very powerful woman. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1935.22s)]
*  Now, but now it's like everything's fine. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1938.54s)]
*  Everything's fine now. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1941.1s)]
*  The breadwinner over here. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1942.9399999999998s)]
*  I'll tell you what happened, though. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1946.0600000000002s)]
*  I do think of myself like I was raised by a single woman. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1948.02s)]
*  Do you forward her the articles? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1951.3000000000002s)]
*  I will tell you the real on this. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1954.38s)]
*  I'll tell you the real on this. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1956.3000000000002s)]
*  He's like, no, she sees it. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1958.22s)]
*  I'm totally fine with her being powerful. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1960.1000000000001s)]
*  I have no I have no envy of her. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1962.8600000000001s)]
*  She's much more famous than me. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1965.5s)]
*  All that stuff is doesn't bother me one bit. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1966.8200000000002s)]
*  But yeah, knowing she made more money than me, still, I would be like, yeah, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1970.6200000000001s)]
*  and I'm supposed to be making like I was very stuck in that. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1974.22s)]
*  Like, oh, my God, I'm supposed to be making more money. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1977.18s)]
*  This is embarrassing. Like, I feel embarrassed by it. Of course. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1979.3s)]
*  I just couldn't shake where I like the water I grew up in. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1983.42s)]
*  I'm like, what other people will think of you or what she will think of you? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1987.22s)]
*  Not her. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1990.46s)]
*  Yeah, what other people will think what I think I'm supposed to be. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1991.74s)]
*  Like that was I that was still one I had. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1997.1s)]
*  I couldn't shake. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=1999.66s)]
*  What happened, though, is we had kids. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2001.14s)]
*  And at some point, luckily, I was like, oh, right. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2003.62s)]
*  This is for all of us. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2007.3s)]
*  Like, fuck you. Go make as much as you can, because this is for these little girls now. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2009.6599999999999s)]
*  It's not even about me. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2014.34s)]
*  And I got over it before I started making a bunch of money. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2015.78s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a break for a second. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2020.6599999999999s)]
*  We got some big games coming up this week. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2022.26s)]
*  Obviously, we have Vikings versus Texans, Eagles versus Saints. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2024.1399999999999s)]
*  But most importantly, we have the Cowboys and the Giants. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2027.1s)]
*  Now, I know Akash likes to pretend like he no longer cares about the Cowboys [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2031.1s)]
*  because they've broken his heart for so many years, even though he got a bunch [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2034.3s)]
*  of fucking championships early in his life. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2038.5s)]
*  How many does he need to get? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2040.3s)]
*  He's spoiled. If you really ask me, the point is Akash right now [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2041.5s)]
*  still cares about those Cowboys. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2047.1799999999998s)]
*  He doesn't want to admit it, but he still deeply cares. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2048.58s)]
*  And when the Giants jam it down their throats, it is going to make him suffer, [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2050.54s)]
*  which I'm sure Alex, myself and any other native New Yorker, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2056.9s)]
*  that supports the Giants is going to be very, very, very excited about. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2061.06s)]
*  Ah, Andrew doesn't know I also recorded ads. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2064.34s)]
*  Hey, Andrew, I don't give a fuck if the Cowboys lose. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2066.5s)]
*  I didn't even know what time they played last week, to be honest with you. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2068.98s)]
*  They could suck my whole dick. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2072.1s)]
*  I still don't have a sports team. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2073.7400000000002s)]
*  I'm going to be honest, I'll probably root for the Cowboys [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2075.42s)]
*  if I happen to catch a game, but I ain't really looking for them anyway. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2077.38s)]
*  Regardless of who you're rooting for, I hope it's the Giants. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2080.5s)]

*  Do you think you had stronger views of what a man is supposed to be [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2099.7s)]
*  because you again, like you didn't have your dad in your life. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2102.7s)]
*  And that's like, oh, this is what a man should be. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2106.2999999999997s)]
*  Oh, I'm the most cliche. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2108.7s)]
*  Like, here was the playbook to be a man where I grew up is like jump shit, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2110.62s)]
*  drink too much, do too many drugs, try to fuck a lot. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2114.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, fight. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2117.2599999999998s)]
*  And I was like, yes, I'll do all of them. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2118.86s)]
*  Like somebody tell me I'm a man. Yeah. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2120.5s)]
*  So, yes, I think I was really susceptible to like whatever [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2122.7799999999997s)]
*  the dudes around me were doing. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2126.18s)]
*  I was going to show them I'm doing this shit. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2127.74s)]
*  I can do all this. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2131.42s)]
*  What's the next thing we do to prove we're a man? [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2132.34s)]
*  So, yeah, I think, you know, because you didn't feel masculine or because [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2135.86s)]
*  because I didn't have a dad at home going like, Tiger, you were great today. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2140.66s)]
*  You're on. You're in route to me. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2144.98s)]
*  You know, I'm proud of you and you're [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2146.66s)]
*  I know it's modeling of another man. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2148.8199999999997s)]
*  It's a lack of modeling. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2150.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I got a couple of stepdads in the mix where it's like, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2152.18s)]
*  I certainly wasn't going to try to be what they were all about. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2155.2599999999998s)]
*  I had an older brother. He was five years older than me. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2158.98s)]
*  He was helpful. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2161.2599999999998s)]
*  I did virtually anything he did. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2162.46s)]
*  He saved my life in sixth grade. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2165.06s)]
*  He's like, listen, you're getting enough. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2166.66s)]
*  You're shaving your sides. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2168.2599999999998s)]
*  You're going to get bangs. You're wearing skater clothes. Go. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2169.66s)]
*  Gave me a full makeover. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2173.5s)]
*  And it worked. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2176.34s)]
*  Yeah. Then I got to junior high and I was like, OK, I got this. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2177.26s)]
*  This is working now. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2180.22s)]
*  So I had him. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2182.38s)]
*  But yeah, I was just really quick to do anything that I thought was [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2183.42s)]
*  what you were supposed to do to be a man. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2187.94s)]
*  What was the dumbest one you did? [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2190.1s)]
*  Oh, my. Look at my hands. I'm like missing knuckles. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2191.9s)]
*  I got fucking metal in my, you know, you were fighting. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2194.38s)]
*  I'm an addict. Yeah. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2197.42s)]
*  Fighting and full blown addict, you know, crashing motorcycles, you know. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2198.38s)]
*  What's your best win in a fight? [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2204.3s)]
*  Was there was there a there is a there is a best. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2206.78s)]
*  This is the worst when guys tell fight stories, but I'm going to do it. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2212.78s)]
*  My wife's like, this is so unattractive. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2216.5400000000004s)]
*  I know. But I'll just say the one that I like the most, which is [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2218.82s)]
*  I, after high school, lived in downtown Detroit with three dudes. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2223.42s)]
*  And then I had moved to California. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2226.98s)]
*  And in my absence, I kept hearing about this dude, Reggie, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2229.5800000000004s)]
*  who was hanging around the apartment building a lot. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2233.78s)]
*  And they were hanging out with Reggie and everything was cool. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2236.0600000000004s)]
*  And they had watched Reggie knock a few dudes out along the way. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2238.5800000000004s)]
*  So the legend was kind of brewing about Reggie. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2242.46s)]
*  Well, then Reggie stole EFACE bike from upstairs. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2245.6200000000003s)]
*  That was like strike number one. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2248.5400000000004s)]
*  Then Reggie stole my friend Aaron's wallet out of the apartment. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2250.02s)]
*  He started stealing a lot of shit. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2253.9s)]
*  So I came home for Christmas. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2255.9s)]
*  And so all my friends are gathered at this old apartment [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2257.7000000000003s)]
*  and fucking Reggie walks through the door. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2260.7400000000002s)]
*  And I'm like, it's I got to tell this dude he can't be here anymore. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2262.98s)]
*  And none of the other guys are going to tell him. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2266.98s)]
*  And it's funny because it was a roundtable just like this. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2268.94s)]
*  I'm sitting on the couch. He walks through the door. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2271.14s)]
*  I step over this roundtable and I walk up and I go, Reggie, you can't be in here. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2273.02s)]
*  He goes, I can't be in here. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2277.7799999999997s)]
*  I go, no, man, you got to go. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2279.18s)]
*  And as I'm saying, you got to go. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2280.2999999999997s)]
*  He fucking caught me. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2282.2999999999997s)]
*  I've never been hit by someone faster. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2284.66s)]
*  I just I was chatting. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2287.14s)]
*  And then I had gone over this exact coffee table. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2288.66s)]
*  Landed with one arm down. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2293.06s)]
*  And I looked over and my then girlfriend staring at me. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2295.18s)]
*  She just watched this guy knock me over a table. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2298.74s)]
*  And in my mind, I'm like, I want to go to bed right now. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2301.54s)]
*  I don't want to deal with any of this. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2304.58s)]
*  And I'm like, everyone's watching. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2306.42s)]
*  We're going. And I got up and went over the fucking table. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2308.18s)]
*  And then I got him in a headlock and it was hockey punches for 45 seconds. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2311.46s)]
*  And then everyone had to pull me off. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2315.7s)]
*  And I just smoked Reggie. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2317.14s)]
*  And it was a real moment for me when my girlfriend was staring at me. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2318.7s)]
*  I'm going to play this and my best friends over here. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2322.66s)]
*  And I think that I only like that one because I did not want to go back at Reggie. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2325.58s)]
*  Did Reggie ever want some revenge? [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2329.7s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. He got it. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2332.1s)]
*  What is even crazier, the element of the story that's even crazier is that all happens. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2333.7s)]
*  He gets thrown out. Now, my best friend since I was 11, still my best friend. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2337.7799999999997s)]
*  We are fucking. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2341.46s)]
*  He's the love of my life. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2343.7799999999997s)]
*  Like, we are as close as two people to two daughters and a wife. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2344.7s)]
*  He was first, though. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2348.5s)]
*  He kind of lost his shit after that. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2350.46s)]
*  Mind you, we're all hammered. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2354.18s)]
*  And he was like, I can't fucking believe I let Reggie do that. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2356.14s)]
*  And he came unglued. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2359.74s)]
*  And then Reggie was hanging out downstairs like an hour later. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2361.2999999999997s)]
*  And then Aaron went downstairs. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2364.06s)]
*  And then there was a round two with Reggie and Aaron that I had to break up. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2365.22s)]
*  And it got a little scary. Oh, really? [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2368.66s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Because he was fighting from a broken heart at that point. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2370.2999999999997s)]
*  He had he had somehow let me down. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2374.3s)]
*  It was a dangerous place to be. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2376.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. The other side of Aaron and that sitch. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2378.5s)]
*  You know, that's one that's maybe the only one. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2381.0600000000004s)]
*  He still has that thing. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2383.0200000000004s)]
*  I heard at the end of a pod, you know, you'll do the little recap. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2385.78s)]
*  He got into some kind of plan. I was being a dickhead, I think. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2388.34s)]
*  And then what did you say to him? [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2390.98s)]
*  He said, tell the story, because it was I thought it was awesome that you were there. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2393.78s)]
*  And then he said, I'm going to go to the bathroom. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2398.2200000000003s)]
*  He said, tell the story, because it was I thought it was awesome [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2400.58s)]
*  that you're kind of like Hollywood elite. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2403.54s)]
*  So for you to say this to a guy on a plane pre TRT, as far as I know, was pretty crazy. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2406.2200000000003s)]
*  It wasn't free if you're talking about the thing that just happened. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2412.26s)]
*  It was a couple of years ago. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2415.3s)]
*  You call the guy a fucking pussy is basically. Oh, yeah. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2417.14s)]
*  He said, you're not going to say what he said in the airplane. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2420.54s)]
*  He said something like, you're not going to do anything about it [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2424.7s)]
*  because you're a fucking pussy. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2426.98s)]
*  And then I think Monica, your cohost, has been in this situation a few times. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2428.38s)]
*  My wife has been in this situation a few times. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2432.54s)]
*  It's definitely a side of myself. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2434.42s)]
*  I really have tried to and have for the most part gotten in back in the clock [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2435.78s)]
*  and the cage, the closet. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2440.02s)]
*  My trigger is bullies. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2444.1800000000003s)]
*  Can't stand if I'm witnessing someone bullying someone else. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2445.86s)]
*  I just got to get in the mix. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2450.1800000000003s)]
*  And I don't know if I'm remembering that one, but this just happened. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2452.42s)]
*  This was more potentially queer suicide, which is Amazon, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2455.82s)]
*  who owns Wondery, whom I do New Deal is with. Yeah. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2460.1000000000004s)]
*  They had asked me, would you come? [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2463.6200000000003s)]
*  Well, Amazon asked me, would you come down to South by and do the panel for [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2464.94s)]
*  Roadhouse? Yep. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2470.1000000000004s)]
*  And so I was like, yes, if I can interview Connor, which he's hard to get to. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2471.5800000000004s)]
*  Huge. Yep. So I kind of broke this whole thing. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2476.1800000000003s)]
*  We do the panel. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2480.1000000000004s)]
*  That's its own very interesting experience, because Connors [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2481.2200000000003s)]
*  pretty hammered on stage. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2484.34s)]
*  And I'm in that position of like, I want to make jokes for the audience [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2485.86s)]
*  and I don't want to get fucking killed real time by Conor McGregor. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2488.98s)]
*  Talk about the high wire act of like kind of doing comedy [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2493.78s)]
*  and kind of there's an assassin next to you. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2496.94s)]
*  I'm like, Janine, I'm going to ask you this question. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2499.7000000000003s)]
*  Connor's going to answer, though, as we know. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2501.6200000000003s)]
*  And I'm like, is that too much? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2503.82s)]
*  Check it in. Yeah. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2505.6200000000003s)]
*  Any management. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2506.78s)]
*  I had done that panel and then we're flying out. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2507.94s)]
*  Monica and I are in first class and the guy in front of us [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2510.5800000000004s)]
*  it starts with his bags in front of his feet. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2514.22s)]
*  Everyone fucking knows you can't have your bag in front of your feet [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2517.7799999999997s)]
*  in the front row. There's no seat to tie. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2520.54s)]
*  And I'm like, this guy's acting like, you know, in the flight attendant is like, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2522.58s)]
*  Sir, can you put your bag up? [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2526.3399999999997s)]
*  And he's like, I thought I might be able to get that past you. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2527.2999999999997s)]
*  And she's like, OK, could you put your bag up? [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2530.58s)]
*  And he's like, OK, you're going to make me put my bag up. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2532.8599999999997s)]
*  And I'm just one row behind. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2534.7s)]
*  I'm like, oh, my God, I hate this guy. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2535.8999999999996s)]
*  So he finally puts his bag up. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2537.58s)]
*  Then she's would you like lunch? [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2539.4599999999996s)]
*  What are the options makes her read him the options. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2541.8999999999996s)]
*  And he goes, OK, a thigh. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2545.7799999999997s)]
*  So the chicken is a thigh. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2548.3799999999997s)]
*  Is that dark meat? [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2550.7s)]
*  And I'm like, how long have you been eating chicken that you don't [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2551.8999999999996s)]
*  fucking know that a thigh is dark meat? [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2554.74s)]
*  Everyone knows he's making her now say what dark meat. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2556.8999999999996s)]
*  So now I'm just like, I can't stand this guy. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2560.4599999999996s)]
*  Not even sounds that crazy. Am I wrong? [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2563.02s)]
*  The bag thing is a problem. Yeah. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2565.66s)]
*  And you got to hear how he was talking to her. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2567.2599999999998s)]
*  It's pretty normal. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2569.58s)]
*  Sure. But then he goes, OK, we have we have a chicken thigh. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2571.06s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, you have a chicken thigh. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2574.86s)]
*  Yeah. Is that white meat or dark meat? [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2576.94s)]
*  It's a little. Give your fucking or do you want chicken or pasta? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2578.98s)]
*  Yeah. Let her do the rest of it. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2582.5s)]
*  Yeah. And then I get up to go to the bathroom [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2584.54s)]
*  and he is just at his seat and I stand up. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2590.94s)]
*  Clearly, I need to go past him to get to the bathroom. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2594.42s)]
*  And now he's just not getting over. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2597.46s)]
*  Right. So now at some point, I'm like, yeah, I'm just going to walk right through him. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2600.46s)]
*  So I just kind of walk right through him and I bump him with my shoulder. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2603.7000000000003s)]
*  He now knows that I don't like him. I think that's clear. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2607.58s)]
*  Yeah. I come back from the bathroom. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2610.02s)]
*  And now when I sit down, he is turned and he's staring at me through [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2612.46s)]
*  the little divide between the two. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2618.1800000000003s)]
*  And he's looking at me smiling and I just stare at him like that. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2620.54s)]
*  Just staring, staring, staring. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2623.54s)]
*  And he goes. You were great in that panel last night. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2626.34s)]
*  And I went, oh, oh, fuck, this guy's like high up at Amazon. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2631.82s)]
*  Why would he have been at this screening? [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2638.2200000000003s)]
*  Oh, my God, I'm fucked. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2641.9s)]
*  And then and then Monica's like, I mean, like, oh, my God, this guy's probably [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2643.1000000000004s)]
*  like probably high up at Amazon. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2646.6600000000003s)]
*  And so now I'm a little panicked because I've been a real dick to him. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2649.34s)]
*  And then he turns around and he opens his computer. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2653.7000000000003s)]
*  And by luck, when he opened his computer, I could see his name, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2656.34s)]
*  like on the lock screen, it said his full name. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2659.34s)]
*  I quickly wrote it on my phone. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2661.54s)]
*  And then I looked it up. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2663.78s)]
*  Thank God he was just a lawyer. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2665.1400000000003s)]
*  He was a lawyer of one of the actors in the movie. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2667.1800000000003s)]
*  And of course, he was a lawyer. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2670.38s)]
*  Yeah. So I don't think that's the story, but that was the most recent one [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2673.46s)]
*  where Monica's like, you don't have to police everyone [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2676.94s)]
*  acting like an asshole. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2681.46s)]
*  And when's the last fight you got to do? Oh. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2682.86s)]
*  Hmm. Like real big fight was [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2686.66s)]
*  probably 15 years ago, someone threw a [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2691.1s)]
*  a guy threw a huge drink at the windshield of my car [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2695.46s)]
*  while Kristen and I were driving somewhere and we were really dressed up. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2698.58s)]
*  And then that was unacceptable. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2703.46s)]
*  He's famous at this point. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2706.58s)]
*  2009, like, oh, the guy was screaming, I'm going to sue you [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2710.54s)]
*  as I went back to the car. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2713.82s)]
*  Like, it was very clear what had happened. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2715.14s)]
*  I got a first good to care. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2718.7s)]
*  You got I thought the windshield, I actually thought the windshield [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2721.58s)]
*  had shattered. It was just all the ice. Yeah. But [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2725.74s)]
*  it was one of those situations, the guys crossing the street [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2729.9s)]
*  in front of Chateau Marmont. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2732.02s)]
*  And if you've been to L.A., there's no crosswalk there. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2733.98s)]
*  It's like a twist in sunset. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2736.38s)]
*  And we're coming down the road and my lane is dead empty. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2738.62s)]
*  And the guy starts walking across. Everything's fine. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2742.54s)]
*  He's going to have plenty of time. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2744.94s)]
*  But then he senses I'm not slowing down, which I don't need to. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2746.18s)]
*  He's got plenty of time. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2749.3s)]
*  So then he kind of steps back out into the road and is like this. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2750.78s)]
*  Like, I should be stopping. He's not in a crosswalk or whatever. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2754.06s)]
*  So I don't slow down. I just kind of go around. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2756.7400000000002s)]
*  As I go around, he chucked this huge drink at the windshield. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2758.9s)]
*  And I thought the windshield shattered. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2762.26s)]
*  So then it was just emergency brake was up and I was exiting the vehicle [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2764.94s)]
*  before it stopped. And then it was in front of a [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2768.0600000000004s)]
*  newsstand. There's like a ton of people watching. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2771.5800000000004s)]
*  They missed the whole drinks. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2774.42s)]
*  They just look up and I'm beating this guy up on the sidewalk [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2776.1000000000004s)]
*  out of nowhere. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2779.82s)]
*  And then he's screaming, I'm going to sue you as I go back to the car. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2781.1800000000003s)]
*  And basically, all this behavior mostly ended [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2784.26s)]
*  because Kristen said the most profound thing to me, which is like, [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2787.78s)]
*  let it go. No, [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2791.62s)]
*  that would have never worked. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2794.34s)]
*  Let it go. Let it go. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2796.1s)]
*  That's not her song. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2799.34s)]
*  She's in the movie. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2800.9s)]
*  That's pretty good. It's a good reference. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2802.5s)]
*  You nailed it. That's a 10. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2805.3s)]
*  No, she said. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2808.34s)]
*  She goes, you you think that [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2810.9s)]
*  people that you love feel safe because you'll protect them. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2815.42s)]
*  Like, that's what you think is happening, right? [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2818.7400000000002s)]
*  And I said, yeah, like you see your mom get beat up. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2820.9s)]
*  You see these things and like, yeah, my job is to whoever I love. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2824.1s)]
*  I'm going to protect. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2828.14s)]
*  And she said, I feel much more scared around you than I feel safe. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2829.42s)]
*  I feel like anything can happen. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2833.98s)]
*  And I don't like that. Whoa. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2836.6600000000003s)]
*  And I was like, oh, that that's bad. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2838.7400000000002s)]
*  That's not what I wanted to hear. That's not what I thought. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2842.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's the opposite of what I thought I was providing. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2845.6600000000003s)]
*  And I really had to go like, oh, this whole thing, [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2850.06s)]
*  this story you have that people love this about you, [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2853.02s)]
*  that you'll stick up for them just makes them feel scared all the time. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2855.9s)]
*  And I was like, I got I got to end this. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2859.2599999999998s)]
*  So there's been like some mild dustups, but also the police were involved [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2862.2999999999997s)]
*  in that one. And I really did think I was going to get sued for a bunch of money. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2865.5s)]
*  And then luckily, what he had done was a felony [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2868.7s)]
*  and what I had done was a misdemeanor, luckily. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2871.54s)]
*  So just like, wow, yeah, don't throw shit at moving cars in California. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2873.42s)]
*  That's that's a no go. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2876.94s)]

*  you can beat the shit out of them. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2880.58s)]
*  And that'll be a misdemeanor. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2882.66s)]
*  Don't throw shit at cars, but definitely respond with violence. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2884.7000000000003s)]

*  The first thing you're with McConaughey. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2916.42s)]
*  That was a rare and exciting one off for both of us. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2918.86s)]
*  For all of us, I would hope. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2923.6600000000003s)]
*  Were you as excited to meet him as I was? [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2925.1000000000004s)]
*  He's great. Oh, my God. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2927.1800000000003s)]
*  So I had him on the show twice. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2928.7000000000003s)]
*  I had also met him one time at a camping event. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2930.42s)]
*  But briefly, I don't really know him, but I was in Austin. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2933.14s)]
*  I was there for work and then I had a few days off. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2937.22s)]
*  And then you and I are DMing and I decide, well, I'm [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2940.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm going to see where he's playing because you just done L.A. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2943.8599999999997s)]
*  and I had missed it and I felt bad. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2946.7s)]
*  And then, lo and behold, you're performing in you [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2948.22s)]
*  while I'm in Austin. Yeah. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2952.3799999999997s)]
*  So then I hit you up and I'm like, oh, my God, I'm going to be in Austin. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2953.9399999999996s)]
*  I want to come see your show. You're like, great. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2956.22s)]
*  How many tickets? I'm like, bro, I think it's just me. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2957.7s)]
*  Like, I was so embarrassed to go like, I think I'm going to be solo at your show. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2960.02s)]
*  But then I don't know why I was like, I'm going to fucking ask Matthew McConaughey. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2964.82s)]
*  He lives in Austin. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2969.94s)]
*  We got along great on the podcast. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2971.78s)]
*  So I kind of cold called McConaughey through emails, through his publicist [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2974.06s)]
*  and our booker of the show. Yeah. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2978.82s)]
*  And then we start emailing and I invite him to your show. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2980.94s)]
*  He doesn't know what I'm inviting him to. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2983.6600000000003s)]
*  And he sends me an email and it's got the green light logo. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2985.98s)]
*  He gave me a green light. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2989.7s)]
*  Let's do this. Let's go to the show. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2990.98s)]
*  So basically, a blind. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2992.8999999999996s)]
*  That's so awesome. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2995.02s)]
*  What a guy. It was basically a blind date with McConaughey. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2996.74s)]
*  But this really funny thing happened, you know, really quickly. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=2999.2599999999998s)]
*  So I had invited him, which is kind of like the alpha move. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3003.2999999999997s)]
*  I asked him out. Yeah. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3006.4199999999996s)]
*  But then he was like, where are you staying? [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3008.1s)]
*  I'm going to pick you up. What time? I'm going to. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3010.54s)]
*  I'll be at seven. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3012.62s)]
*  Good. You're on four seasons. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3013.9399999999996s)]
*  I'll be there seven o'clock. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3015.8599999999997s)]
*  I'll pick you up. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3016.98s)]
*  I'll be in a white like a navigator look for me. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3017.78s)]
*  And I'm like, OK, really good impression. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3020.34s)]
*  Hold on. I'll get better as I get into it. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3022.98s)]
*  So I'm like, oh, wow. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3026.94s)]
*  He's now he's picking me up. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3028.34s)]
*  He's outlaying you now. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3029.94s)]
*  And then he goes, so what are these tickets? [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3031.1s)]
*  What do you got set up? [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3033.86s)]
*  Because, you know, we can do a suede if you want. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3034.82s)]
*  And I'm like, look, whatever thing you want to do, [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3036.94s)]
*  like if that sounds better than probably what I'm going to get, like, let's do that. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3040.26s)]
*  Right. So he's like, OK, great. I pick you up. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3043.54s)]
*  So now he's got his own tickets for us. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3045.7s)]
*  It started with me having tickets. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3048.06s)]
*  And so it's it's such a dream come true. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3050.06s)]
*  I come down into the lobby of the four seasons and I walk out. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3053.46s)]
*  And sure enough, there's a white Lincoln navigator and he's outside. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3057.54s)]
*  He's he's he's leaning against car. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3061.02s)]
*  He's talking about who's come through here. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3062.98s)]
*  OK, they said we got sorority with Kona. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3065.2599999999998s)]

*  He's holding for a fucking total McConnay style. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3068.54s)]
*  Totally living up to my dream of what he is. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3073.34s)]
*  He's just so happy, so fucking comfortable in his own skin. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3075.94s)]
*  We get in the car again. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3079.9s)]
*  We don't know each other all that well. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3081.26s)]
*  Yeah, we're on the way there. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3083.46s)]

*  I put together some private equity money and we've got the state of Texas involved. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3091.46s)]
*  And we built this thing. It's gorgeous. I haven't been. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3095.46s)]

*  Like you would have heard about that long before you even met me. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3125.3s)]
*  So this is coming out on my car ride. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3128.2200000000003s)]

*  That was my kind of invention. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3154.94s)]
*  I'm like, this guy is so fucking cool. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3156.82s)]
*  He's one of the few people that guys and girls equally have a crush on [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3159.46s)]
*  for different reasons. Yes. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3162.5800000000004s)]

*  I want to walk around. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3169.1400000000003s)]
*  I had no clue you guys weren't like besties. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3170.02s)]
*  Oh, no. So you're going to like the end of the story that you don't know about, [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3172.1800000000003s)]
*  which is car ride there is fine. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3175.78s)]
*  I it's like it's good. It's a good first date car ride. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3180.1800000000003s)]
*  But then and this was tactically a blunder, [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3183.38s)]
*  which is now we're just watching stand up. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3186.14s)]
*  We can't really talk. Yeah. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3188.8199999999997s)]
*  So now we're just sitting next to each other. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3190.3799999999997s)]
*  We don't really know each other. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3192.2599999999998s)]
*  And we ended up having a great time. You were great. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3194.1s)]
*  And then you were fucking what was a relief to me is like, he loved you. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3196.66s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. He loved you. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3201.42s)]
*  You got into a certain thing about talking to your wife. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3203.22s)]
*  And we were like, oh, that's exactly what it's like. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3205.8599999999997s)]
*  And so we had a really fun moment. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3210.3399999999997s)]
*  And then what was cool about him was I know, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3212.58s)]
*  I need to go say hi to you. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3215.8599999999997s)]
*  It would be rude if I don't go say hi to you. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3217.46s)]
*  But also, I don't know his baseline, like how much he wants to be mobbed. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3219.98s)]
*  And so I'm like, I'm going to have to tell him at some point, [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3225.22s)]
*  we got to stick around. I got to go say hi to Andrew. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3227.22s)]
*  But he goes, you probably want to say hi to your buddy. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3229.8199999999997s)]
*  Should we go backstage? [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3232.2599999999998s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, my God, this guy's a mensch. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3233.2999999999997s)]
*  Like he offered. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3234.9s)]
*  Yes. So then we go down, we hang out with all you guys. That's great. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3236.94s)]
*  You just start interviewing him immediately. Immediately. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3239.7799999999997s)]

*  That is exactly what happened. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3254.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, all of a sudden, he's like on him talking about his political aspirations. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3256.7400000000002s)]
*  I'm like, I would have never asked that on a first date. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3260.86s)]
*  But now I'm learning this because Shultz. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3262.78s)]
*  I'm so bad at small talk, I'm so painfully bad at it. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3264.3s)]
*  No, I was actually thinking, honestly. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3267.38s)]
*  So I have to ask the questions I'm really curious about, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3269.3s)]
*  because then it comes across more authentic and pure to me. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3271.42s)]
*  And you are super curious if he'll run for office. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3274.06s)]
*  I want he mentioned it. He was talking about it. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3276.58s)]
*  Yeah, we would actually, I think, as a population, love that. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3279.06s)]

*  Oh, my God. Yes. And that'll pay off here. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3284.34s)]
*  We thought you've always been at the beginning. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3287.98s)]

*  You're you're pretty much on a date with him now. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3291.5s)]
*  Now you have talked to him way more than I've talked to him. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3293.46s)]
*  OK, right. Yeah. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3295.86s)]

*  Like it's just we have we held the room for you to because I was like, [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3298.78s)]

*  Whether that was an issue or not, who knows? [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3312.66s)]

*  We didn't like get into a good groove of a conversation. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3345.42s)]
*  So I'm like, it's a little bittersweet. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3348.98s)]
*  We're leaving. We're walking in the car. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3350.82s)]

*  We are going to compete to see who gets the best sleep for the month of October. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3480.18s)]

*  All right, guys, take a break for a second. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3520.94s)]
*  At this point, I'm sure you're aware that sleep is the most important thing in your life. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3522.38s)]
*  Your mood, your longevity benefits you get from exercise, everything, your recovery. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3525.7s)]
*  It's all based on sleep. How are we going to maximize our sleep? [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3531.42s)]
*  I'm sure you've heard of eight sleep. OK, if you haven't heard about eight sleep, [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3534.2599999999998s)]
*  it is revolutionary sleep technology is called the pod. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3537.66s)]
*  And what is brilliant about this is they actually sell mattresses. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3541.5s)]
*  What I think is really smart about this one is that they can sell essentially [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3544.8599999999997s)]
*  a fitted sheet that has all the technology that eight is developed to help track [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3548.54s)]
*  your sleep, help improve your sleep by adjusting the heat [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3554.62s)]
*  and the coolness of the bed that you are sleeping on. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3559.22s)]
*  But what is great about this is most people don't want to leave their mattress. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3562.58s)]
*  They like their mattress. They spend a lot of time buying their mattress. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3564.7799999999997s)]
*  So they're not immediately going to jump on board with this eight sleep mattress [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3567.1s)]
*  because they don't know if it's going to be comfortable. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3570.46s)]
*  Well, when you have that fitted sheet, you have solved all the problems. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3571.9s)]
*  And if you are really, really into eight and you want to take it to, [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3574.98s)]
*  you know, up a notch or two, then you can even get their mattress. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3578.46s)]
*  But what I would recommend, at least in the beginning, [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3581.2999999999997s)]
*  if you're not in the market for a new mattress, is you check out the pod for Ultra. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3583.5s)]
*  OK, cool as it heats and now it even elevates automatically. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3588.7s)]
*  It's also clinically proven to give you up to one hour more sleep. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3591.94s)]
*  Think about that one hour more of quality sleep. That is unbelievable. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3595.5s)]
*  And there is also now an adjustable base that fits between your mattress [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3599.3s)]
*  and the bed frame to add reading and sleeping positions for the best unwinding experience. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3602.82s)]
*  And if you snore, the pod can even detect your snoring, [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3607.46s)]
*  automatically lift your head by a few degrees to improve airflow and stop you [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3610.22s)]
*  or your partner snoring. That is absolutely unbelievable. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3615.2599999999998s)]
*  Now you have to wake up your partner. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3618.02s)]

*  Yeah. He and I got along so fucking well. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3844.26s)]
*  We're neighbors and we're DMing and then I'm like, [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3846.78s)]
*  I was asking if he wants to get a hamburger maybe. Right. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3849.94s)]
*  So I asked him, you want to get a hamburger? He's like, yeah, let's get a hamburger. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3852.26s)]
*  So we decide where we're going to go. And we had scheduled it like. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3855.34s)]
*  Does sound less cool than steak. Yeah. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3858.7000000000003s)]
*  Shit is steak and salad is. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3860.5s)]
*  But he was saying hamburger a lot. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3862.38s)]
*  Want to get a Jack Black. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3864.5s)]
*  He's like, let's get a classic hamburgese at Yuccas Mexican restaurant. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3866.94s)]
*  But it was like two weeks out, we made this plan. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3872.1s)]
*  So I put it in my calendar and then day of we're supposed to have lunch at noon, [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3874.34s)]
*  day of probably nine a.m. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3878.58s)]
*  I send him a DM on Instagram that just goes like, hey, [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3880.1800000000003s)]
*  confirming we're meeting at noon at Yuccas. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3882.9s)]
*  So noon comes along and I look and I have no response from him for like three hours. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3886.46s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm going up to Yuccas. He's not going to be there. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3892.26s)]
*  Like I'm going to get stood up. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3895.26s)]
*  So I'm at Yuccas like 10 minutes early. I feel awkward. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3896.74s)]
*  So I go into a liquor store and walk in circles for a while. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3899.9s)]
*  Then I come back out. Then I'm like, OK, I can sit in front of Yuccas. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3902.86s)]
*  I feel like I'm like I'm on a date with a woman, to be honest. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3906.74s)]
*  I'm like, I got to look cool when you walk. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3909.58s)]
*  Four seconds away from grabbing a bottle of Boone's farm. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3913.78s)]
*  Why'd you start drinking again? [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3918.34s)]
*  Jack Black was late for a hamburger. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3920.3s)]
*  No choice. What is that going to remain sober? [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3922.42s)]
*  So I go back out. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3927.38s)]
*  Now I'm sitting in front of Yuccas by myself and I'm feeling really stupid. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3930.14s)]
*  And I'm also thinking, OK, well, not only is he not coming, [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3933.06s)]
*  he will eventually read that DM and like three days feel really guilty [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3937.62s)]
*  and apologize. What's going to be my move then? [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3941.78s)]
*  I'm already planning that out. Right. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3943.78s)]
*  And I decide in that moment, I'm going to say I cried for an hour and a half. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3946.14s)]
*  And then then I even go to like my wife's going to ask, [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3951.3s)]
*  how was your lunch with Jack Black? [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3954.5s)]
*  And I'm going to have to admit I got stood up. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3956.22s)]
*  So I'm like already planning who I have to tell I got stood up to. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3958.06s)]
*  And all of a sudden I feel someone grab my thing and it's Jack Black. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3962.02s)]
*  And he's in his like military hat. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3964.66s)]
*  He's going over here. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3966.02s)]
*  And all of a sudden we leave Yuccas and he takes me to another restaurant [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3967.38s)]
*  and we sit down there and I go, I thought you weren't going to show up. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3971.54s)]
*  He goes, I knew you weren't going to show up. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3976.34s)]
*  I told my wife when I was leaving, he's not going to show up. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3978.38s)]
*  And when he says he sends me an apology text, [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3981.22s)]
*  I'm going to tell him too bad. That was your one chance. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3984.14s)]
*  And I go, oh, I went even further. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3986.5s)]
*  I was making up excuses to people that knew I was having lunch with you. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3988.14s)]
*  And so our first 10 minutes was owning the fact that we were both certain [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3991.58s)]
*  we were going to get stood up and that we had crafted text messages to each other. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=3995.18s)]
*  And other people we told I was like, this is awesome. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4000.46s)]
*  You're Jack Black and you're insecure. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4003.82s)]
*  And I should not be insecure. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4005.46s)]
*  And we're both terribly insecure. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4007.98s)]
*  We were going to get stood up on this date. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4009.42s)]
*  And now it's heaven. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4011.22s)]
*  That that that that DM that morning, as you're telling me the story, [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4012.22s)]
*  I'm going through my emotions. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4017.22s)]
*  And the day of you're like, he's not going to show. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4019.98s)]
*  I know exactly how you think he's Jack Black. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4022.02s)]
*  He's got things to do. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4025.02s)]
*  That's easy to forget. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4026.1s)]
*  He probably is so artistic. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4027.58s)]
*  He probably is probably terrible with his schedule. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4028.8599999999997s)]
*  All the justification for why he can't. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4031.02s)]
*  He wears tie dye. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4033.06s)]
*  Those people are good at scheduling. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4034.06s)]
*  Of course, he's not going to meet me. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4036.06s)]
*  And he think you were going to show since you sent the message. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4037.4599999999996s)]
*  That's what's adorable is like even Jack Black thinks he's going to get stood up. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4039.9s)]
*  We all think so. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4044.1s)]
*  Except for probably McConaughey. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4046.7799999999997s)]
*  McConaughey knew I was going to be there on time. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4048.18s)]
*  I think that's part of what's so alluring about him is one thing that makes me feel [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4052.46s)]
*  better about being insecure. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4055.7799999999997s)]
*  There's been some very powerful people here and I'll see things where I'm like, [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4057.34s)]
*  oh, they were being insecure. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4060.54s)]
*  And you realize everybody feels that. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4062.18s)]
*  And then you see a guy like McConaughey who just seems comfortable in his own skin. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4064.18s)]
*  And that's such a superpower that you're like, wow, that guy's fucking awesome. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4067.8999999999996s)]
*  I want to be like that guy. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4072.94s)]
*  Yes. Yes. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4074.14s)]
*  It's very enviable. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4075.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4077.18s)]
*  His comfort level in his own skin. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4077.7s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4079.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4080.46s)]
*  It seems like this is not a judgment. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4081.46s)]
*  Like he enjoy he can enjoy it. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4084.58s)]
*  He has figured out how to enjoy that attention and feel what it really boils down to, [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4087.5s)]
*  too, is if you feel worthy of it or not. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4091.74s)]
*  That's the crux of it all, because I had this experience where I started therapy [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4094.94s)]
*  two and a half years ago for real. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4101.9800000000005s)]
*  I had done couples therapy, but I had not really had a real I'm going to do this [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4104.62s)]
*  once a week and I'm going to do this for a while. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4108.3s)]
*  And that therapist said to me. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4110.58s)]
*  Because the deal with Spotify was very large and I didn't I wasn't really ready [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4115.26s)]
*  for that, which sounds weird to say, but I just was like, you shouldn't get this. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4121.34s)]
*  Someone's going to take this away. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4129.9800000000005s)]
*  You don't deserve this. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4131.22s)]
*  All these things. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4132.18s)]
*  Imposter syndrome. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4133.06s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Big time. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4134.18s)]
*  I have that. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4135.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4135.74s)]
*  And he said, look, in life, sometimes you will make a huge choice and that'll [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4136.5s)]
*  enact change and growth or one can land on your lap and you can either grow into it [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4144.46s)]
*  or you will lose it. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4149.18s)]
*  And he's like, so you have to grow into this and you have to accept that this is [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4150.54s)]
*  real and that you deserve it or you will lose it. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4154.26s)]
*  And I was like, oh, that's so weird to think about. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4157.14s)]
*  But over the course of working with him for a year, I would have I would have had a [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4159.42s)]
*  whole explanation for you as to why I don't want to take a picture with somebody at a [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4164.38s)]
*  restaurant. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4170.38s)]
*  And I have good points I could make about that. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4171.3s)]
*  And I would say like, well, they don't even really want to meet me. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4174.34s)]
*  They just want a picture for their thing so they can get attention. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4176.66s)]
*  And I'm not terribly sympathetic to that. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4179.34s)]
*  You know, I had all these they're logical. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4180.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that wasn't really what was going on. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4182.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4185.46s)]
*  Because as I started feeling more and more worthy of that attention and praise from [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4186.26s)]
*  strangers, lo and behold, I didn't mind the interaction as much. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4190.46s)]
*  I was like, yeah, I'm happy to do this. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4195.78s)]
*  I found myself offering my wife and I were on a flight and I said to the pilots, I [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4197.46s)]
*  was like, I don't know if you guys want to picture together. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4201.900000000001s)]
*  We were happy to do that. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4204.58s)]
*  And they were like, oh, my God, you guys are the first people to ever offer. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4205.74s)]
*  And I was like, oh, I loved that. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4209.18s)]
*  Oh, it had nothing to do with those other things. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4210.98s)]
*  I guess when you came up to me and gave me attention and approval, I didn't think I [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4212.7s)]
*  deserved it. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4221.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4222.26s)]
*  I was like, you retrofit all these justifications. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4223.22s)]
*  It just reminded me that I didn't deserve it when I don't like that feeling. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4226.0599999999995s)]
*  So I'd rather just not do it at all. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4229.7s)]
*  I think there's an advantage being a standup in these types of situations. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4232.26s)]
*  And I think being a podcaster, yes, because when you're a character and you're an actor, [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4237.7s)]
*  you know that people love that care. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4244.179999999999s)]
*  They like Ross from Friends. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4245.74s)]
*  They want to pick with Ross. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4246.86s)]
*  They won't. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4248.0199999999995s)]
*  They don't want the guy who's acting as Ross. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4248.46s)]
*  Yes. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4250.7s)]
*  And, you know, with Tom Cruise, like, yeah, he's so famous, but like, I'm really I'm in [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4251.54s)]
*  love with Maverick. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4255.74s)]
*  I don't really know anything about Tom Cruise. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4256.98s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4258.86s)]
*  And that can definitely curate this imposter syndrome, which like, does anybody really [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4259.099999999999s)]
*  like nobody really knows me? [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4263.099999999999s)]
*  Why do they even want a picture with me? [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4264.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4265.5s)]
*  When you're sharing your life as you do on the pod and people feel really connected with [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4265.82s)]
*  it and they want a picture with you. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4270.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's me. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4271.74s)]
*  It is the definition. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4272.82s)]
*  The podcast has been what has allowed me to accept it, because even if people would come [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4275.54s)]
*  up to me and say, I love idiocracy. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4280.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4282.82s)]
*  I go, that's my judges compliment. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4284.0599999999995s)]
*  Like that movie, that movie. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4286.42s)]
*  And you love it because of my judge. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4288.74s)]
*  I got to be in it and I'm lucky, but it's not my parenthood. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4290.179999999999s)]
*  That's not my compliment. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4293.74s)]
*  That's Jason Kadem's compliment. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4294.86s)]
*  And I would always have whoever's compliment it was, but it never was mine. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4296.299999999999s)]
*  I think I think a lot of I would imagine a lot of actors go through that specifically [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4300.58s)]
*  because they understand what it is to like write and direct a movie and how different [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4306.78s)]
*  that is to act in a movie. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4312.139999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4313.74s)]
*  Not to say that it's not there aren't actors that were incredibly talented. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4314.299999999999s)]
*  There are. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4317.38s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4318.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4318.42s)]
*  But if you follow directors that you really care about and writers you really care about, [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4318.74s)]
*  you'll tend to find a trend for you really enjoy all the works. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4323.46s)]
*  Yes. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4326.5s)]
*  You just follow an actor you bet. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4326.78s)]
*  Oh, I didn't really like that one as much. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4327.9800000000005s)]
*  And yeah. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4329.82s)]
*  In the best case scenario as an actor, you can not suck in things that suck. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4330.82s)]
*  That's the high water. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4335.14s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4336.18s)]
*  That was Burt Reynolds kind of defining quality. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4337.62s)]
*  And he ended up getting a chip on his shoulder at the height of his career, which was a [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4341.06s)]
*  bummer, which was, and he said, I have, I have, I'm a Burt Reynolds super fan and I [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4344.38s)]
*  have his playboy interview from like 79, where he has been the biggest movie star [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4349.18s)]
*  for eight of the last 10 years, almost unparalleled. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4354.18s)]
*  And he's mad. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4357.5s)]
*  He's never gotten nominated for an Oscar. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4358.42s)]
*  And he said, look, Dustin Hoffman's in this movie with this great script and this [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4361.1s)]
*  great director smoking the bandit was a 30 page outline. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4366.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4369.740000000001s)]
*  Like what I did in that, but he's right. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4370.18s)]
*  And so on some level he's right. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4372.9800000000005s)]
*  I, I, I raise the bar of this movie. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4374.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4377.26s)]
*  And deliver you the biggest movie of 1977 that is, but you got to shut the fuck up [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4377.46s)]
*  about that. You got to just enjoy being the biggest movie star. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4382.3s)]
*  I see a couple Burt movies and he's like, he's the coolest guy on the screen, but [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4385.38s)]
*  like he kind of is that in everything. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4388.82s)]
*  Burt or? [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4391.14s)]
*  Burt. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4391.9s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4392.3s)]
*  Like I've seen Longest Yard. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4393.18s)]
*  I was, I didn't finish it. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4394.06s)]
*  I was rewatching Smoking the Bandit and Netflix literally took it off the next day. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4395.22s)]
*  But how old are you? [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4399.02s)]
*  I'm 40. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4400.5s)]
*  40. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4401.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4401.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4402.42s)]
*  I'm about to turn 50. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4403.06s)]
*  Smoking the Bandit was, I mean, that was the movie. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4404.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4408.22s)]
*  If you could grow up and drive a Trans Am around for like, even in the movie, [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4408.9400000000005s)]
*  Sally Field asked him, what do you do? [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4412.9400000000005s)]
*  And he goes, I show off. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4415.7s)]
*  That's his fucking job. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4419.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4420.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4420.62s)]
*  His job is to do donuts in a Trans Am and embarrass the law enforcement trying to [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4420.82s)]
*  catch him. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4425.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4425.9400000000005s)]
*  So as a kid I was like, that's, that's what I want to do. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4426.34s)]
*  I want to be, I want to be the bandit. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4429.5s)]
*  But about getting recognized, I always say this about you. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4431.34s)]
*  You're the best I've seen at being comfortable being yourself. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4433.5s)]
*  I feel is still like a pressure to like be as nice as possible and whatever. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4436.94s)]
*  And then I'm like, I will do that. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4441.34s)]
*  But I don't want to be here too long because I feel like this is a lot of pressure on me. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4442.78s)]
*  He's from the Geico days, 2014, 2015. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4446.54s)]
*  I would look at him. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4450.54s)]
*  I'd be like, this guy's so fucking comfortable just being himself with these people. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4451.22s)]
*  And I've always, I've always admired that. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4454.86s)]
*  I think it's the stand up. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4457.06s)]
*  It's like, if you like me firm, stand up. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4457.86s)]
*  That's something that I'm proud of and I work hard on. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4460.42s)]
*  And I at least know that you're appreciating a thing that I've created. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4462.82s)]
*  You have total ownership over it. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4466.38s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I do too. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4467.7s)]
*  But I'm still like, hey, it's also funny and say that too, because you're right. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4469.139999999999s)]
*  Like you ask yourself, I remember watching comedians and cars getting coffee in Seinfeld [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4473.74s)]
*  with Galifianakis. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4480.259999999999s)]
*  People are filming them and that's annoying. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4482.86s)]
*  Like there's a lot of, there's a lot of layers to it. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4485.139999999999s)]
*  One is like, you don't have control. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4488.46s)]
*  Well, I'm someone who likes control. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4490.0599999999995s)]
*  And I also don't like if a dude's doing something and I've made it clear to that person, [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4491.74s)]
*  especially a dude, I don't like this and you're still doing it. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4497.0199999999995s)]
*  It's a, it triggers something for me. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4500.18s)]
*  That's like, well, you think you can dominate me or you can ignore what I'm saying. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4501.98s)]
*  So again, step down. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4505.7s)]
*  So there's that baggage. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4507.26s)]
*  Then there's just the, you don't have control. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4508.74s)]
*  Like, okay, five people want a pitcher. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4511.0599999999995s)]
*  That's fine. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4512.9s)]
*  But if the rest of the people in the restaurants just see someone getting their [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4513.66s)]
*  foot, they don't even fucking know who you are, but now they want in. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4516.82s)]
*  And then there's a feeding frenzy. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4519.78s)]
*  Like I've seen this with my wife. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4521.02s)]
*  Well, that's just very uncomfortable and a tad bit scary. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4522.540000000001s)]
*  And you've just lost control of your environment. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4525.46s)]
*  So that's all fine and dandy, but Seinfeld says to Galifianak, cause he's like, [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4527.820000000001s)]
*  you're really upset about this. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4532.38s)]
*  And he goes, but it happened and it's over. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4533.9800000000005s)]
*  And it was five minutes. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4536.1s)]
*  Like he really frames it. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4537.06s)]
*  Clearly a dude who's had a lot of experience getting comfortable with it. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4538.9400000000005s)]
*  And at the end of the day, I just had to ask myself like, well, who do I. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4543.1s)]
*  Admire when I see them deal with it. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4546.820000000001s)]
*  And it's always the people that are that way. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4548.700000000001s)]
*  They're chill about it. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4550.74s)]
*  I don't admire the guy that's got the boundaries and is good. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4551.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4555.58s)]
*  I don't want to be that guy ever. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4555.9s)]
*  Cause you lose by the way, you feel bad when you're that way. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4557.3s)]
*  I have been rude to people, particularly once we had kids, like I still, you can't [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4560.34s)]
*  take pictures of my kids and I don't like you filming. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4566.099999999999s)]
*  So that still gets a little trigger. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4568.0599999999995s)]
*  But at the end of the day, even if I tell them, you know, I'm nice, please delete [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4570.099999999999s)]
*  the photo of my kid, but then I just feel bad afterwards. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4575.62s)]
*  Like I'm feeling bad. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4579.179999999999s)]
*  They feel bad. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4580.02s)]
*  Everyone feels the same as a loss for everybody. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4580.660000000001s)]
*  Versus if I go out of my way and be nice, I actually walk away and I go like, yeah, [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4584.1s)]
*  yeah, I like myself better when I have that reaction. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4587.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4590.26s)]
*  I, yeah, the boundary thing I'm not. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4590.700000000001s)]
*  How do you play it when you're at a social function and you see someone like a hero [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4592.700000000001s)]
*  of yours that's way more like the super successful, you're like, holy shit, this [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4596.38s)]
*  guy's here. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4600.02s)]
*  Like, do you go up to him and say, what's up? [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4600.580000000001s)]
*  Like specifically when you were like younger in Hollywood? [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4602.26s)]
*  No, I never would do that. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4604.740000000001s)]
*  In fact, I've been around Bill Murray three times. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4607.3s)]
*  He and Letterman are my gods. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4611.1s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't ever want to have an interaction with them until he wants to [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4615.02s)]
*  have one with me. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4620.18s)]
*  It's not going to happen, but there are some people I was around and I waited long [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4621.1s)]
*  enough and then they did want to talk to me. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4625.7s)]
*  And that's just, I don't want the interaction where they're trying to get away from [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4627.22s)]
*  me. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4632.1s)]
*  I'd rather just look at them and not have that. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4632.22s)]
*  Do you ever have, I guess my ego. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4634.740000000001s)]
*  Do you ever have a moment where you met someone that you really admired and you're [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4636.02s)]
*  like, oh fuck, I wish I didn't. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4638.26s)]
*  He's not who I looked up to or admired or whatever. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4640.46s)]
*  Never meet your heroes kind of moment. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4644.700000000001s)]
*  That's a good question. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4646.620000000001s)]
*  I would have to give a name at that point, probably. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4647.580000000001s)]
*  I mean, I can just say that like I had been around Brad Pitt a couple of times. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4650.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4655.660000000001s)]
*  And I would not say a word because I am so in love with Brad Pitt. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4656.22s)]
*  It's insane. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4659.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4660.9400000000005s)]
*  And then through a crazy course of events, he did talk to me at some point and I was [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4661.66s)]
*  like, oh, here we go. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4667.860000000001s)]
*  I'm glad I, oh, really funny one was Stern. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4669.38s)]
*  Kimmel had a party for Howard Stern as he does, right? [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4673.34s)]
*  He comes to LA and Kimmel always does this great party. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4676.46s)]
*  And Kristen and I were lucky enough to get invited to one of those. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4679.18s)]
*  And then, and then by luck had it that like two weeks later, I ended up being on Stern [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4682.780000000001s)]
*  for the first time. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4689.54s)]
*  And he goes, yeah, I'm seeing that you were at this party Kimmel threw for me, but you [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4691.42s)]
*  didn't say hi. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4695.900000000001s)]
*  And I go, well, yeah, I was like trying to be the hot girl at the party that's like [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4697.18s)]
*  ignoring you. And hopefully you'd be intrigued to come start talking to me. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4700.54s)]
*  He goes like, well, that didn't work. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4703.780000000001s)]
*  I didn't even know who you were. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4705.3s)]
*  Totally backflipered. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4707.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, that's the risk it runs. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4709.22s)]
*  I probably could have met you, but I was like, I'll wait. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4711.46s)]
*  There's a, you know, Norm MacDonald to put out this book. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4714.18s)]
*  I think it was released maybe before he died or maybe was after. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4717.9400000000005s)]
*  I'm not exactly sure. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4720.42s)]
*  But there was this excerpt in the book. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4721.58s)]
*  I'm pretty sure it was Norm's. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4723.3s)]
*  And he talked about like how lucky he was being famous. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4724.46s)]

*  I'm not suggesting you put anything in there at all. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4803.26s)]
*  But look, they won't get crushed and they're conveniently hidden in case, you know, cops [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4806.820000000001s)]

*  Let's get back to the show. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4954.58s)]
*  Well, two things. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4955.58s)]
*  I read an interview with Owen Wilson again in Playboy and he had a lot in there. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4957.139999999999s)]
*  It wasn't raunchy enough for me to masturbate to. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4967.0599999999995s)]
*  I had other material that I looked at for that, but then I really was there for the [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4969.58s)]
*  interviews. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4974.66s)]
*  They were the best ever. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4975.66s)]
*  But Owen was in an interview. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4976.94s)]
*  I've memorized like half of this interview in Playboy. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4978.22s)]
*  He said so many funny things. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4980.7s)]
*  But one of them was exactly that. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4982.34s)]
*  The guy asked, do you mind getting recognized? [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4984.3s)]
*  And he goes, well, you know, you got to see that you're pretty much like where you go, [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4986.3s)]
*  you're giving people like the greatest part of their day just by being there. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4993.0s)]
*  That's kind of cool. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4998.18s)]
*  And I was like, oh, that's great. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=4999.18s)]
*  The question he answered that I think is so Owen and funny is he said, do you have any [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5002.0199999999995s)]
*  tricks about getting out of speeding tickets? [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5006.02s)]
*  And he goes, yeah, what I try to do when I get pulled over is just start talking to the [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5008.18s)]
*  guy and make a couple of jokes and be friendly. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5013.780000000001s)]
*  And what you're really heading towards is that moment where he just looks up and goes, [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5017.700000000001s)]
*  look at us on the side of this road playing our roles in this crazy game called life. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5022.780000000001s)]

*  The comedy of this crazy game called life. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5035.94s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5039.099999999999s)]
*  He had also just read like a book on dog breeding and he like recited half of this book in the [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5040.419999999999s)]
*  interview. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5045.58s)]
*  Yes. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5046.58s)]

*  No, unrelated to Marley and me, but great dig. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5053.299999999999s)]
*  But back to the people treating you like shit. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5057.419999999999s)]
*  This is a funny thing I have with my wife, which is we have our youngest daughter is [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5059.78s)]

*  And I said, after I watched Delta go through life for about six years, I was laying in [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5073.04s)]
*  bed with Kristen and I was like, you have no fucking clue what life on planet Earth [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5078.76s)]
*  is like. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5084.12s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5086.12s)]
*  Because this was you growing up. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5087.12s)]
*  Just a pretty super cat man. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5088.12s)]
*  Everywhere you went, everyone was happy to see you. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5089.12s)]

*  Now I know. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5096.72s)]
*  Now that I'm watching this little person just float through life with this butterfly of [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5097.72s)]
*  charisma, I'm now realizing you don't know what's happening in the real world. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5102.4400000000005s)]
*  Most people hate you upon seeing you and they don't want to help you and they don't want [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5107.16s)]
*  to be inconvenienced. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5111.6s)]
*  And that's life on planet Earth. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5112.6s)]
*  But she has no clue that that's part of it. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5115.08s)]
*  And when you said that, what was her reflection? [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5116.92s)]
*  She just laughed. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5118.400000000001s)]
*  That is so interesting. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5121.400000000001s)]
*  In the social part of life, which is probably the most anxiety inducing to most people, [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5122.52s)]
*  there are some people that can kind of float through that effortlessly. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5126.4800000000005s)]
*  McConaughey is one of them. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5128.96s)]
*  For whatever reason, he is comfortable being McConaughey. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5130.360000000001s)]
*  And Kristen, for her to get famous wasn't some huge... [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5133.400000000001s)]
*  You see a lot of dudes, particularly dudes in Hollywood, they weren't social butterflies [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5137.120000000001s)]
*  in high school. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5143.56s)]
*  Women did not like them. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5145.240000000001s)]
*  And now all of a sudden, they have all this access and people like them and then there's [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5146.64s)]
*  this distrust and then there's this weird misogyny that comes about. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5149.96s)]
*  It's like a cauldron of grossness. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5153.6s)]
*  Whereas Kristen was like, wait, everyone likes me now? [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5156.76s)]
*  Yeah, everyone has always liked me. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5159.72s)]
*  Now there's just more people. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5162.32s)]
*  I think that was a very easy transition for her. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5164.6s)]
*  Dude, you're right about the misogyny that comes from it because it's that same imposter [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5166.92s)]
*  syndrome. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5171.72s)]
*  I don't deserve it. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5172.72s)]
*  Now they like me. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5174.12s)]
*  It can't be for me. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5175.12s)]
*  It must be for the success. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5176.12s)]
*  You don't really like me. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5177.8s)]
*  I resent you for liking this thing. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5178.8s)]
*  Yes. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5181.0s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5182.0s)]
*  And it happens with billionaires. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5183.0s)]
*  By the way, this was our conversation with McConaughey. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5184.72s)]
*  I'm like, you're one of the guys that this has just been consistent. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5186.88s)]
*  The stage has just gotten bigger and bigger. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5190.400000000001s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5193.2s)]
*  The guys get a lot of money, especially the tech guys. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5194.2s)]
*  They want to be in the social scene. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5196.320000000001s)]
*  But they resent the fact that people only are inviting them to things or even come to [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5197.64s)]
*  their parties because they have the big Hollywood mansion. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5202.64s)]
*  And they purposely got it for that reason. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5205.719999999999s)]
*  And they resent that it's working. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5208.24s)]
*  But it doesn't fill the hole. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5210.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5211.8s)]
*  Okay, let's talk about filling the hole. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5212.8s)]
*  Now that you've gotten success, is there a moment... [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5217.04s)]
*  Well, you've always had a level of success, for sure. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5220.08s)]
*  But now I think it's, at least through the success of the pod, has just... [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5223.84s)]
*  Well, it's just what metric are you looking at? [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5227.5199999999995s)]
*  Because really now it's just financial. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5230.12s)]
*  Actually, in the past, I was more recognizable. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5232.4s)]
*  I was on Parenthood for six years that ran non-stop. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5234.88s)]
*  Punk was really big. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5237.84s)]
*  Some of these movies were big. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5238.84s)]
*  So there were... [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5240.599999999999s)]
*  Recognizably, I'm sure I was more recognizable seven years ago. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5241.599999999999s)]
*  But the depth of connection you have with your supporters and fans... [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5246.2s)]
*  The armchairs. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5251.08s)]
*  I think you're underplaying. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5252.08s)]
*  That is a part of the zeitgeist. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5254.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5255.88s)]
*  Armchairs for expert on experts. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5256.88s)]
*  Yeah, 1000%. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5257.88s)]
*  I don't think, and I don't mean this in any disrespect, Parenthood wasn't part of the [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5258.88s)]
*  zeitgeist. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5261.0s)]
*  Well, you also weren't a 36-year-old woman in 2008. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5262.68s)]
*  When I think of the zeitgeist, I don't think of that very specifically. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5266.68s)]
*  Thank you, and I concede to all that. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5271.68s)]
*  But basically what I'm trying to say is there is a metric for success that we all have. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5273.68s)]
*  Things that we want to achieve and that maybe they will fill that void. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5278.52s)]
*  Maybe some people don't have a void and there's just things they really enjoy doing. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5282.64s)]
*  Do you feel that you have... [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5286.64s)]
*  If you, one, did you have a void? [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5289.12s)]
*  Oh my God, yeah, I was a fucking addict. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5291.68s)]
*  I've got a manhole cover inside. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5293.68s)]
*  But do you think that... [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5296.68s)]
*  Are you at this point now where you're like, I don't need to do anything else and I feel [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5298.4400000000005s)]
*  accomplished and I have filled it all up? [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5302.4800000000005s)]
*  Or are you still fighting? [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5305.2s)]
*  You get this deal, you're like, what's the next one? [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5307.68s)]
*  What's the next biggest guess? [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5309.6s)]
*  No, but it wasn't the deals that gave me that. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5311.6s)]
*  Although they certainly play a role, there's no question. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5315.84s)]
*  But kids are what do that for you. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5319.64s)]
*  What was so incredible about... [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5322.84s)]
*  Look, I had other movies that had failed before Chips, but Chips was the most heartbreaking [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5325.56s)]
*  because I had spent so much time on it. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5332.240000000001s)]
*  But I came home, I was on a car ride home and I was really depressed. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5333.64s)]
*  And then I walked in the door and I was like, oh yeah, these kids don't know that you even [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5339.12s)]
*  made a movie. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5342.160000000001s)]
*  They don't give a fuck and you're still dad. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5343.160000000001s)]
*  Being dad is the first identity I've put on that is real and substantive and permanent [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5346.16s)]
*  and cannot be taken from me and is not at the whimsy of the box office or what was happening. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5353.96s)]
*  This is a real identity. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5359.04s)]
*  I am these two girls' dads and that is my number one job and everything else can suck [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5360.68s)]
*  a dick. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5367.08s)]
*  I like it all, but it doesn't fucking matter. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5368.08s)]
*  These kids are everything. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5370.639999999999s)]
*  So they really fill the good chunk of the hole. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5372.2s)]
*  I have real purpose. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5375.48s)]
*  I actually care about some people more than myself, which was new. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5376.48s)]
*  It's an important... [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5380.879999999999s)]
*  And then the other stuff, and what's funny is like, I'm a greedy pig. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5383.28s)]
*  I was obsessed with money. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5390.04s)]
*  I was hard to negotiate with. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5391.879999999999s)]
*  I wanted the most as an actor. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5393.44s)]
*  I wanted the most as a director. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5394.679999999999s)]
*  I wanted to make money. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5395.679999999999s)]
*  And then I did not need a podcast to make money. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5398.16s)]
*  I did not think you could make money in a podcast. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5401.2s)]
*  I didn't know there was money in a podcast. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5403.32s)]
*  Funny how life works. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5404.88s)]
*  I didn't think it would be big. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5405.88s)]
*  I thought I liked to talk to people and I liked being a guest on people's podcasts. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5407.400000000001s)]
*  And I thought, well, why don't I do this for fun? [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5411.56s)]
*  And then lo and behold, that's the thing. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5414.4400000000005s)]
*  That's how it works. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5416.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5417.72s)]
*  What do you think happens when you start the podcast? [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5418.72s)]
*  What do you think? [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5421.240000000001s)]
*  I remember Gordon actually saying... [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5422.240000000001s)]
*  Real quick, before we get into the podcast, can we talk about the kids? [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5423.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5426.08s)]
*  Okay. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5427.08s)]
*  So... [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5428.08s)]
*  Because you have a little girl. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5429.08s)]
*  I have a little girl, yeah. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5430.08s)]
*  And I was really fortunate. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5432.4400000000005s)]
*  My parents were awesome. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5435.080000000001s)]
*  And I'm super grateful for that experience. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5436.080000000001s)]
*  My dad was awesome. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5440.280000000001s)]
*  Handsome. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5441.280000000001s)]
*  Handsome. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5442.280000000001s)]
*  But a really great dad who had a shit dad. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5443.280000000001s)]
*  And I think he decided I'm not going to be a shit dad. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5446.320000000001s)]
*  He was making up for it. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5449.320000000001s)]
*  And it worked. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5450.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5451.84s)]
*  And... [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5452.84s)]
*  Okay, so... [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5453.84s)]
*  But this feeling that they are the deciding factor, they are the arbiter of your happiness [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5456.08s)]
*  in a lot of ways, right? [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5465.32s)]
*  It's not this random, oh, you post a video and if people watch it or if people like this [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5467.12s)]
*  interview, which has been most of your life, you're submitting yourself to the whims of [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5471.28s)]
*  the public. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5475.12s)]
*  The arbiter of your worth. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5476.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5477.12s)]
*  Right? [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5478.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5479.12s)]
*  Okay. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5480.12s)]
*  So, the debate is on you for... [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5481.12s)]
*  Are you concerned about their success? [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5484.48s)]
*  Do you just concern about loving them as they start to become human beings? [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5486.28s)]
*  Are you trying to push them in certain directions you think will be beneficial? [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5490.68s)]
*  Right now, I'm just loving her. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5496.92s)]
*  And that's the thing that I do. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5498.2s)]
*  And it's the best in the world. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5499.2s)]
*  But there's going to be a time where she's going to ask me questions. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5501.0s)]
*  And I have these conversations with myself right now where I'm like, okay, is this the [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5504.0s)]
*  best answer for this? [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5507.24s)]
*  Maybe I should talk to my friends and ask, am I equipped to solve life's problems? [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5508.76s)]
*  Yeah, but isn't it so fun? [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5514.76s)]
*  Like, generally, you're mulling over and ruminating on something that's really quite pointless. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5516.88s)]
*  You're like, yeah, what are my ratings? [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5521.4800000000005s)]
*  What are these things? [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5523.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, those questions are like, they're so real and important. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5524.4400000000005s)]
*  I love just thinking about them. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5530.280000000001s)]
*  And there's, you know, I don't have the playbook. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5532.4800000000005s)]
*  My kids have a swimming pool in their backyard. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5535.040000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5536.8s)]
*  I didn't have a swimming pool. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5537.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm like, oh, is money going to fuck them up? [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5539.08s)]
*  Will they be hungry? [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5541.24s)]
*  Do you worry about that? [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5543.56s)]
*  Well, where I've landed on all of it is like, in a weird way, I obsess about money so much. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5544.6s)]
*  So much of my life was about that. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5550.72s)]
*  I had a fantasy of what having it would feel like, what it would do for me, what it would [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5551.92s)]
*  heal. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5555.6s)]
*  That wasn't the case. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5556.72s)]
*  Maybe for other people it is. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5558.280000000001s)]
*  It wasn't the case for me. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5559.56s)]
*  I found I got to find that I'm lucky enough to have found that out. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5560.88s)]
*  So in some weird way, I feel like, well, maybe they'll be liberated from that. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5564.36s)]
*  Like, they don't have to go make money. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5568.48s)]
*  If the thing they do does make money, awesome. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5571.5599999999995s)]
*  If it doesn't, also, they're going to be OK. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5574.599999999999s)]
*  What I care the most about, and by the way, you'll observe this, is I was in my backyard. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5577.96s)]
*  We had a patio and there were these steel poles that held up an overhang. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5584.04s)]
*  And they're whatever, seven feet tall. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5587.679999999999s)]
*  And when Lincoln was about two, I'm just sitting out there doing whatever. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5589.599999999999s)]
*  She starts trying to climb the pole. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5593.92s)]
*  And she just did it over and over and over and over again for like an hour until she [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5596.4s)]
*  got to the top. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5602.16s)]
*  And I went, oh, she'll be good. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5603.16s)]
*  She got it. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5605.16s)]
*  She genetically has got it. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5606.72s)]
*  If she wants something, she's going to fucking kill herself until she can do it. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5608.72s)]
*  And then I just took a breath. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5613.12s)]
*  I'm like, OK. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5614.4s)]
*  Also, duh, her mom's will go get her. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5615.76s)]
*  I'm going to go get her. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5618.0s)]
*  Odds are they're probably genetically hit the lottery in some level, as far as being [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5618.92s)]
*  hungry and go get her nest. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5623.0s)]
*  So now I'm just like, I just want them to catch fire for something. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5625.6s)]
*  I don't give a fuck what it is. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5629.24s)]
*  My ego wants them to be writers because I'm a writer and that's the shittiest job and [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5631.0s)]
*  the one I feel proudest about. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5635.16s)]
*  So I want them to be writers, but I don't care. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5636.76s)]
*  I don't care. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5638.84s)]
*  As long as they're on fire for it and they're trying really hard at it, that's great. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5639.44s)]
*  And I kind of want them to be fucking losers and live at my house for the rest of my life. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5645.16s)]
*  I used to think I wanted them to go to a good school. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5648.16s)]
*  No, don't ever go. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5651.16s)]
*  Don't go to college. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5651.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5653.04s)]
*  Flunk out and fucking live at my house for life. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5653.4800000000005s)]
*  OK, the relationship with you and your wife. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5656.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5660.12s)]
*  I imagine they are learning how to be treated and how to treat a guy through your relationship. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5661.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5669.2s)]
*  My parents set the expectation of like how I should treat a girl and how a girl should [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5669.76s)]
*  treat me. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5674.28s)]
*  Yes. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5675.04s)]
*  Yes. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5675.56s)]
*  I probably reflect on that through every certain situation I'm in, even in my marriage. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5676.36s)]
*  Yes. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5680.92s)]
*  Yes. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5681.32s)]
*  Are you like cognizant of that, like in your treatment of one another in front of them? [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5682.759999999999s)]
*  If you guys ever get into a fight, are you concerned that that will be like normalized? [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5687.5599999999995s)]
*  No, we do a thing. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5691.759999999999s)]
*  This will trigger a lot of people, I think, on the far right, which is like if we do get [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5693.5199999999995s)]
*  in a fight and we resolve it behind closed doors, which is what most couples do, all [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5699.0s)]
*  the kids saw was the fight part. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5706.599999999999s)]
*  So they get good at knowing how to escalate things. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5708.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5711.36s)]
*  They don't see the resolution part. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5711.88s)]
*  So we were in a pretty good habit of like when they saw a dust up and then we resolved [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5715.0s)]
*  it, we would then tell them, hey, I said to mom, look, when you said this, it was me being [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5721.24s)]
*  eight years old. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5729.32s)]
*  I thought you were going to do this. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5730.04s)]
*  And then mom says, and we tell them how we resolved. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5731.24s)]
*  My wife sent me that clip. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5734.24s)]
*  I think it's fucking awesome. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5735.28s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5736.48s)]
*  I think for some people, for some reason. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5737.8s)]
*  There's pushback on this? [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5739.72s)]
*  There's pushback on a lot of stuff we do. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5740.96s)]
*  But yes, that seemed to, I don't know, people think kids don't need to see that or something. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5743.52s)]
*  I don't know what it is. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5748.12s)]
*  Maybe they just- Teaching kids how to resolve is massive. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5749.12s)]
*  I didn't, for my wife and I never grew up knowing how to resolve anything. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5750.88s)]
*  No, of course not. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5753.8s)]
*  It's just like magic happened. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5755.04s)]
*  All of a sudden it blew over, but you missed out on the whole- [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5756.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, your parents just tell you it's okay, couples fight and that's it. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5758.64s)]
*  But the thing you're saying about, I'm way more than I'm conscious of it with my wife. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5761.320000000001s)]
*  I'm conscious of it with them, which is, let's just assume the stereotype that girls marry [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5766.08s)]
*  their dad is semi-true. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5773.64s)]
*  I certainly married my mom. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5775.28s)]
*  There's no question about it. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5776.96s)]
*  That's a big responsibility. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5780.4s)]
*  If they're going to go out and try to get me, then how am I treating them? [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5782.88s)]
*  And so just right out of the gates, I take everything they say seriously. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5786.04s)]
*  I'm listening. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5789.5199999999995s)]
*  I am asking follow-up questions. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5790.88s)]
*  So if they meet a dude that's not listening to them or isn't, they're going to be like, [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5793.5199999999995s)]
*  what the fuck is this? [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5796.879999999999s)]
*  They'll expect that, whether they- I don't yell at them. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5799.08s)]
*  I have fucking boundaries and I'm the disciplinarian, but I don't yell. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5803.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't get physical with them. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5807.5599999999995s)]
*  Just these little things that this is what they expect from a dude for life. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5810.28s)]
*  Anyone falling short of that, they're going to be like, what the fuck? [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5814.639999999999s)]
*  What is this? [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5816.799999999999s)]
*  This isn't what I'm used to. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5817.799999999999s)]
*  I even took it so far that I was like, OK, if I ride motorcycles and girls marry their dads, [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5820.8s)]
*  probably she'll date a dude that rides a motorcycle. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5828.68s)]
*  And then there's no way I can have her on the back of some 16-year-old's motorcycle. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5831.2s)]
*  And I'm like, the only way you inoculate someone from that is she's got to ride. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5835.12s)]
*  Because no one who rides is ever riding on the back of a motorcycle. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5839.360000000001s)]
*  So my girls have been riding motorcycles since they were five years old. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5842.88s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, they ain't getting on back of some- [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5847.84s)]
*  Because you're like, I'm not going to stop riding motorcycles. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5850.28s)]
*  Yes, you're falling and I'm like, dude, yeah, that's all I'm saying. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5852.759999999999s)]
*  I don't know if this helps. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5857.32s)]
*  And I heard it from a guy who was a great father, but it was even before he had kids. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5858.32s)]
*  Luther, my best friend from college, we were talking Indians. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5861.8s)]
*  You grew up in an Indian household. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5865.5199999999995s)]
*  So much conversation is what are you going to be when you grow up? [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5866.599999999999s)]
*  And when they ask that, they mean, how are you going to be a doctor? [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5869.4s)]
*  And I was joking around. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5871.84s)]
*  There's other options I've heard. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5873.24s)]
*  You could be an engineer. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5874.92s)]
*  Yeah, but all of those are disappointing. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5876.599999999999s)]
*  Back up plan is- [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5879.56s)]
*  Doctor is, yeah, that's the thing. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5880.400000000001s)]
*  And I was talking to him about, you know, what do you want your kid to be? [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5882.56s)]
*  Blah, blah, blah. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5885.080000000001s)]
*  And he just said, honestly, all I want is for my kids to be good people. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5886.0s)]
*  And that was so simple, but blew my fucking mind that, oh, yeah, that's all that matters. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5890.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5895.56s)]
*  Just be good people. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5896.240000000001s)]
*  So what's interesting is that's Kristen's position and it's a great one. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5897.6s)]
*  I also think they need, shit does hit the fan. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5903.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5906.360000000001s)]
*  So like, and this, by the way, is what I love about raising kids together with her. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5907.48s)]
*  She has a completely different point of view than I do. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5912.719999999999s)]
*  We have completely different experiences. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5915.0s)]
*  If one of our kids becomes an addict, she's not going to know what the fuck to do. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5917.04s)]
*  That's kind of my domain. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5919.879999999999s)]
*  If, you know, they want to go to school and study musical theater, they go talk to mom. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5921.5599999999995s)]
*  That's what she did. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5925.799999999999s)]
*  But that just lines up. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5927.0s)]
*  So I think they're getting a, I hope they're getting a nice dose of like, Kristen and I are opposites. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5928.12s)]
*  And we somehow live in the same house. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5933.639999999999s)]
*  We have the same two kids and we took different routes to get here. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5936.16s)]
*  So I think that's kind of the fun of having a partner is like, yeah, she's making them very kind. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5938.48s)]
*  I'm also like, when you walk by a dude, look, I'm straight in the eyes. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5944.76s)]
*  I see you. I'm not looking away. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5948.4s)]
*  I'm not afraid. Like, I'm here. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5950.16s)]
*  You know, like they're getting that too. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5952.5199999999995s)]
*  And, you know, hopefully they're picking up both. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5955.4s)]
*  Yeah, they're going to fuck people up and sing about it. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5960.68s)]
*  It's like a jigglypuff. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5963.72s)]
*  Outsiders the musical. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5966.4400000000005s)]
*  Do you get worried because you like they're going to grow up privilege and you became the person you are through, like, all the things you've had to deal with. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5967.76s)]
*  Do you feel like you need to like try to instill some of those things into them? [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5978.08s)]
*  Yeah, like manufacture some challenges and struggles. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5983.52s)]
*  Yeah, I'm super aware of that. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5988.320000000001s)]
*  And yes, we could make the world pretty easy for them if we wanted to use all the resources. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5990.32s)]
*  But like, no, they go to a public school. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=5996.44s)]
*  Oh, really? Yeah, I'm like, no, no, you're going to have to go. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6000.12s)]
*  I don't want you to only know how to talk to rich kids. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6002.599999999999s)]
*  You got to like talk to everybody. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6004.88s)]
*  There's a lot of little things I do. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6008.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, make them do. That's kind of completely unnecessary. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6011.12s)]
*  But yeah, I want them. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6014.16s)]
*  I don't want them just to know how to talk to other kids with rich parents. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6016.04s)]
*  Yeah. Get down with I mean, I think the thing that I [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6019.68s)]
*  I do like most about myself is like I can get down with anybody. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6024.200000000001s)]
*  I can get that I can go with Bill Gates for a fucking week to India and chat with that dude [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6028.6s)]
*  and be good. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6033.160000000001s)]
*  And then I can sit at a fucking gas station in Detroit and talk to six dudes [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6034.6s)]
*  that are going to a club. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6038.84s)]
*  And I can do that. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6040.240000000001s)]
*  And then I can talk to the hillbillies at drag racing. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6041.320000000001s)]
*  So I like I love that. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6043.88s)]
*  I want to be able to talk and connect with everybody. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6045.72s)]
*  And I want that for them. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6048.84s)]
*  I would not want them to miss out on how many radicals [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6050.24s)]
*  you have to put them in those situations. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6053.04s)]
*  Yes. About that skill set. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6055.04s)]
*  Yeah, like we I'm into cars, right? [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6056.56s)]
*  We'll go cruise Crenshaw on a Sunday when it's hot and we'll post up in the Lincoln. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6058.08s)]
*  And I pull the girls bicycles out and they're just riding their bikes on Crenshaw. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6063.360000000001s)]
*  And like, we're the only white folks there with the fucking cool car. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6067.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6071.360000000001s)]
*  Start talking to people. Let's get this going. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6072.6s)]
*  Did you read any books on the topic or anything that was like productive? [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6075.88s)]
*  No, my wife read a ton of books, though, and reported them back to me every day. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6078.8s)]
*  How awesome is that? Thank God I'm not the only one. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6081.96s)]
*  I feel so guilty about this. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6084.320000000001s)]
*  My wife learns everything. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6086.0s)]
*  She sits there, she pours through Google searches and books, [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6087.28s)]
*  and then she just she's chatty for me. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6090.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just prompt her. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6093.0s)]
*  Yeah. And then boom. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6094.8s)]
*  Oh, but thank God. OK. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6096.320000000001s)]
*  There's a really good I want to say it's make an effort. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6098.12s)]
*  Read some books. I got the books. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6100.76s)]
*  So I got them. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6103.8s)]
*  I put them on the Kindle as well. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6106.28s)]
*  And then I don't know if I can defend you also, you just grew up with a great dad. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6107.679999999999s)]
*  So you just saw it every day. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6111.679999999999s)]
*  So you didn't really feel like you smile when I play with her. Yeah. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6112.96s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6116.719999999999s)]
*  It seems to learn whatever we do is work. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6117.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah. You had a shit dad. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6120.04s)]
*  So I don't know why you didn't read a book. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6121.36s)]
*  My mom was radical and mostly my parenting techniques are mostly just my mom, [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6123.28s)]
*  which was like everything was on the table. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6129.24s)]
*  You could talk about anything. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6130.88s)]
*  Yeah, no, like, awesome. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6132.5199999999995s)]
*  Kid gloves. There's no line. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6133.719999999999s)]
*  I'm a big fan of just now if you can get through it all without lying. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6135.759999999999s)]
*  What about what about a relationship? [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6139.599999999999s)]
*  Like, obviously, you have a kid. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6141.28s)]
*  The relationship changes drastically. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6142.679999999999s)]
*  How did you guys manage that with first kid? [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6145.679999999999s)]
*  Speaking of these books, one of the books we got before our first kid arrived [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6148.16s)]
*  was Brain Rules for Babies. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6151.919999999999s)]
*  And thank God, the first chapter you read is like they tell you right. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6154.36s)]
*  Right. In the first chapter, I want to say the number. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6158.04s)]
*  It's either like 68 or 70. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6160.88s)]
*  It says 70 percent of marriages get worse after kids. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6162.4800000000005s)]
*  We're like, oh, OK. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6165.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good heads up. Yeah. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6167.92s)]
*  So I think going into it, knowing like, no, no, it's going to get fucking worse. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6170.4800000000005s)]
*  It's going to get harder. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6174.96s)]
*  You're going to have less time for each other, less patients, less sleep. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6176.04s)]
*  You're going to become kind of like [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6180.4400000000005s)]
*  co-managers of these fucking kids. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6183.68s)]
*  And that's hard. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6186.2s)]
*  And we've had hard stretches. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6188.28s)]
*  I will say that they do get to an age. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6190.44s)]
*  And I think a lot of people don't make it through that part. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6193.12s)]
*  But they life starts coming back in like, oh, we can go on a three day trip. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6197.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, we can do this. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6203.5599999999995s)]
*  And it starts seeping back in. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6204.759999999999s)]
*  But yeah, if I charted how hard it got, it would certainly peak. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6206.879999999999s)]
*  You know, when they're like six and four years old, forget it. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6210.759999999999s)]
*  You're like, cool, I live with this gal. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6213.879999999999s)]
*  I think these are our kids. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6216.16s)]
*  We're doing this together. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6217.719999999999s)]
*  But I can't imagine she wants to see me. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6219.48s)]
*  It's reality distorting. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6221.839999999999s)]
*  Yes, because when you're with the kid, it's euphoric. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6223.2s)]
*  They laugh and they smile. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6228.28s)]
*  And then you and your wife are the happiest you've ever been in your life. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6229.919999999999s)]
*  So you're like, yeah, we're happy. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6233.4s)]
*  Everything's good. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6234.719999999999s)]
*  But then you guys aren't spending any time together, even though you're together. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6235.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. So you feel like you're getting that same emotional diet satisfied. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6240.28s)]
*  Yeah. But you're not at all like we actually had to like sit down and reflect on it. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6244.24s)]
*  We're like, what is different here? [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6247.48s)]
*  We're spending tons of time together. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6249.2s)]
*  And then we're like, oh, no, we don't talk the same way we do. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6250.92s)]
*  Going out to dinner is much more difficult. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6255.8s)]
*  We're exhausted. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6258.0s)]
*  Yeah. And we had to make a conscious effort to like pour back in a little bit, [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6259.2s)]
*  even if it's 30 minutes. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6263.639999999999s)]
*  Also, the amount of compromise, I guess it depends. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6264.8s)]
*  I certainly know dads that are like, yeah, you decide everything. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6268.5199999999995s)]
*  I'll pay for everything. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6272.84s)]
*  Well, that's not the scenario in my life. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6274.12s)]
*  My wife is a gangster. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6275.76s)]
*  She's going to have a lot of say in whatever. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6277.32s)]
*  And I'm very opinionated. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6279.5199999999995s)]
*  So I think even the kids and how we're going to raise them and making all these [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6280.76s)]
*  minute to minute decisions, that's just Christianized nature. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6285.679999999999s)]
*  Like we come from different points of view. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6289.4s)]
*  We generally have to compromise. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6291.4s)]
*  So it's just like another thing to compromise about. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6293.44s)]
*  But it's now something you care way more about than you did about what restaurant [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6297.44s)]
*  you're going to. Right. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6301.48s)]
*  So you're like, no, this is vital to me. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6302.76s)]
*  They have to be this way or they have. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6304.639999999999s)]
*  So, yeah, it's a it's a recipe for just a lot of stress. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6306.68s)]
*  And it gets rough preparing for that is, I think. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6312.56s)]
*  And like once you can view it through that lens, like doing anything exhausted [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6316.0s)]
*  is tough. Yeah, right. Like if someone was like, hey, there's no kid. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6320.92s)]
*  But you're going to be exhausted in your relationship for the next eight months. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6324.04s)]
*  You'd be like, OK, this is going to be a little harder. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6327.240000000001s)]
*  Yes, exactly. Or the next few years. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6328.84s)]
*  Years. Yeah, exactly. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6331.0s)]
*  But you guys are going to be your worst self for the next five years. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6332.6s)]
*  Good luck. Just tell us. Yeah. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6335.56s)]
*  What happens is that you're smacked in the face with it a few months in. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6337.64s)]
*  You're like, what the hell is going on? Yes. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6340.080000000001s)]
*  Being able to reflect for us, that was very helpful. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6341.92s)]
*  Like huge. And at least you understand it. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6345.400000000001s)]
*  And then when you can kind of pour back in, even if it's like tiny little bits of time. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6348.84s)]
*  You there's this like reminder of just why we got to the point [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6353.76s)]
*  where we're like, hey, we really want to bring life into this world. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6357.88s)]
*  Yeah, this is pretty awesome. Yeah. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6360.280000000001s)]
*  Well, I this is pathetic, but there are moments in that stretch [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6362.52s)]
*  where I would be at my sink brushing my teeth and I would force myself [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6368.64s)]
*  to look over at her brushing her teeth and I'd go, that's a real person right there. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6372.88s)]
*  That's a human being who needs love and is afraid. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6378.280000000001s)]
*  It needs compassion and comforting. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6382.080000000001s)]
*  She's a real but she's not a fucking robot mom. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6384.200000000001s)]
*  As much as we're both now robot parents, I'm like, [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6387.76s)]
*  but I had to take like I had to be thoughtful and go like, [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6390.44s)]
*  that's a that's a little girl over there. Yeah. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6393.92s)]
*  Who's in overhead, just like I'm a little boy who's in over my head. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6395.88s)]
*  And OK, yeah. Hi. Hi. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6398.88s)]
*  This is hard. Yeah. Yeah. It's scary, right? [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6401.96s)]
*  You're afraid you're doing a bad job. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6404.76s)]
*  You've been with Chris in 17 years now. Yeah. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6407.24s)]
*  What is the number one piece of advice you have to make it last? [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6409.8s)]
*  Oh, man. We were lucky enough that we started therapy [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6415.16s)]
*  like three months in the dating. Yeah. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6420.8s)]
*  This is not going to work. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6422.84s)]
*  We were explosive together at first in there. And [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6424.2s)]
*  I will say now, having done it that way, it was like my previous relationship, [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6429.12s)]
*  which was long as well as nine years. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6433.24s)]
*  We went to couples therapy at the end. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6435.28s)]
*  And it's like taking your car to the shop. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6437.599999999999s)]
*  And it's like, you know, trans is blown to someone who's around. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6439.599999999999s)]
*  This is like you should have fucking changed the oil knucklehead. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6442.8s)]
*  Eight years ago. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6446.24s)]
*  And I will say, like we went in, they were short. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6447.6s)]
*  We didn't do a ton of them. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6450.240000000001s)]
*  But the dude was like, here's what's happening. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6451.200000000001s)]
*  You guys are stuck in this pattern. He says this. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6453.68s)]
*  You always say this that triggers this. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6455.72s)]
*  Stop saying that and stop doing this. It was really pragmatic. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6457.6s)]
*  It wasn't like, you know, a theory. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6460.64s)]
*  Oh, we had to connect with our inner child. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6462.92s)]
*  It's like, stop saying this. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6465.08s)]
*  And when you say this. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6466.4800000000005s)]
*  And so I think luckily, we broke a few patterns [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6467.88s)]
*  that would have destroyed us really early on. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6472.08s)]
*  That was helpful. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6475.160000000001s)]
*  And then. I would just credit for me, [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6477.28s)]
*  a which is like in a I figured out [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6481.08s)]
*  how to assess what was going on with me in situations. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6484.719999999999s)]
*  I don't know that I would have learned that had I not had to be in a, [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6489.24s)]
*  which is like there's one step in particular, which is crazy effective. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6493.639999999999s)]
*  It's the four step. And it's really good. It's misleading. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6499.08s)]
*  First, all they ask you to do is like, write a hundred people, [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6502.0s)]
*  write all the people you have resentment against. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6504.84s)]
*  You know, like, oh, that's fucking easy. I hate that teacher. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6507.24s)]
*  I hate this person. I hate, hate, hate, hate, hate. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6509.68s)]
*  And then the next column, you have to say, [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6512.28s)]
*  what did that person threaten in your life? Right. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6514.96s)]
*  And so you write what they threaten my financial security, my status. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6519.32s)]
*  By the way, there's only like six things people threaten. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6523.16s)]
*  And then you look at this list and you hate one hundred and fifty people. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6526.12s)]
*  And you realize what fear they're triggering. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6530.400000000001s)]
*  It's three fucking fears. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6533.04s)]
*  Like if I have these three fears, my status, my social, uh, or my, um, [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6535.12s)]
*  my financial security, um, if I don't have those three fears, [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6539.4s)]
*  I don't have problems. I know these hundred people aren't on this list. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6544.04s)]
*  And then the last column is like, well, what am I doing? So the example, [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6548.04s)]
*  I think they gave him the book, which is great. It's like, I hate Bob from work. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6551.08s)]
*  Why? Why? What's Bob do? He's constantly trying to get me fired. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6554.04s)]
*  What does that threaten my financial security? What's my role in it? [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6558.04s)]
*  Well, if I don't show up late, [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6562.24s)]
*  there's really nothing Bob can say to the boss. Uh, as you're like, okay, great. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6563.52s)]
*  So now I know my three fears. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6568.0s)]
*  I also know what I'm doing that enables all that cycle to happen. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6569.6s)]
*  So that just practicing that for years when Kristen and I would get in a fight, [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6573.76s)]
*  I at least knew enough to go like, that's interesting. Whatever is going on right [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6578.240000000001s)]
*  now. I know it's not going on. I know me good enough. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6581.68s)]
*  Now one of these three things is really being threatened right now. Give me five. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6584.52s)]
*  I just want to figure out which of those three things is happening. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6588.4800000000005s)]
*  And now I can come back into this and go like, yeah, [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6591.799999999999s)]
*  I feel really emasculated when that happens. And my, [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6594.839999999999s)]
*  I I'm worried about my status all the time and it's a shitty character defect of [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6597.4s)]
*  mine. And I overreacted and you know, [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6602.2s)]
*  character defects. And usually that's all that's, [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6605.2s)]
*  she's got her list of three things that she's constantly triggered over. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6607.28s)]
*  And so I think just like learning to pause fights and figure out what was [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6610.48s)]
*  actually happening with me other than the dishwasher or the whatever thing you [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6615.2s)]
*  think it's about going like it's never ever about any of those things. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6619.2s)]
*  It's about like these three core fears I have. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6623.96s)]
*  And if I can figure out which one of it is, I can really, um, [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6626.88s)]
*  right size it in my head. Like, Oh, this is an old thing. This happened. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6631.08s)]
*  I had to apologize to my, um, my, my now nine year old, we're laying in bed. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6634.04s)]
*  She had given me a riddle the day before I had answered it. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6639.76s)]
*  Now we're laying in bed and she tells me that I got the answer wrong. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6642.48s)]
*  And I'm like, no, honey, I said, whatever. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6646.36s)]
*  I give the same answer to the riddle. She's like, no, no, you said this. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6648.72s)]
*  And I'm like, that's not, and now all of a sudden I'm like, [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6652.280000000001s)]
*  I mean an actual power struggle was an eight year old in bed about whether I [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6654.6s)]
*  said this or that. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6659.08s)]
*  And then she got cranky and I got cranky and I was just kind of a Dick. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6660.72s)]
*  I wouldn't let up about it. I'm like, yeah, you got this one wrong. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6664.320000000001s)]
*  I'm like, there's no way I would say that. I know math really well, [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6668.240000000001s)]
*  whatever the thing was that night. I go to bed. I'm like, that was weird. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6670.76s)]
*  That's not how you talk to Delta. And then the next morning I came to her and I [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6675.84s)]
*  go, listen, I want to apologize about last night. I overreacted. You know, [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6680.2s)]
*  I was dyslexic in school. I got sent to the learning disabled room. I, [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6684.44s)]
*  I walk around with people thinking I'm stupid. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6689.0s)]
*  And if there's any moment where I look stupid, I overreact so bad. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6692.32s)]
*  And that was what happened last night. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6696.2s)]
*  I don't know whether I got the riddle right or not, who knows, [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6697.639999999999s)]
*  but that's what was going on. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6699.84s)]
*  I'm sorry that I was taking that out on you and my apologies. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6700.92s)]
*  And she goes, Oh daddy, I'm so sorry. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6705.0s)]
*  You had to go to learning disabled. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6707.88s)]
*  Back to like, you know, honey, when you get one right, you're like, Oh, [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6714.0s)]
*  that's right. That's what you do. You just go on your shit. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6718.08s)]
*  And then they immediately meet you with a compassionate understanding and it's [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6720.96s)]
*  great. And the fight's almost worth having to hear her say, Oh daddy, [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6725.0s)]
*  I'm so sorry. You had to go to learning. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6728.72s)]
*  Radical accountability. Yeah. Like that, that worked, I guess from AA. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6730.879999999999s)]
*  It's like you were four. I, [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6735.12s)]
*  I'm going to figure out what I can control what I'm doing wrong. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6736.48s)]
*  Cause I can't live with my own. You think, [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6739.44s)]
*  I don't live with other people's mistakes. I don't, I live with mine. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6744.4s)]
*  People have wronged me. Tons of people have wronged me over the last 50 years. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6747.36s)]
*  I'm not in bed thinking about those. I'm in bed thinking about shit. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6750.679999999999s)]
*  I did an eighth grade. Shit. I did in 12th grade. Shit. I did a 24. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6753.599999999999s)]
*  Like I have the laundry lists in my head of things. I fucked up. So it's like, [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6757.48s)]
*  I can't live with the discomfort of like, if I've recognized, [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6761.16s)]
*  I've done something wrong. I, I just gotta go clean it up. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6765.0s)]
*  Cause I'm the one that's going to suffer from it. The other person, [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6768.48s)]
*  Delta wouldn't have thought about that thing the next day, but I'll think about it. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6771.36s)]
*  And so it's my own probably selfish, you know, [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6775.72s)]
*  preservation, but I can't live with a big pile of errors. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6780.0s)]
*  The forgiveness is, is for self. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6784.64s)]
*  A lot of people have said that forgiveness. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6788.64s)]
*  It's allowing you to relinquish these feelings. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6791.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6794.44s)]
*  It's simply letting that other person get over it and get away with another great [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6794.8s)]
*  saying from a is, um, you know, [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6798.88s)]
*  resenting people is like drinking poison and hoping they die. Yeah. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6801.4800000000005s)]
*  You're the one. Yeah. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6805.84s)]
*  You're the one. You're the only one this thing's living inside of. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6806.76s)]
*  And it's like, what a victory to give this person you're already mad at, [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6809.68s)]
*  that you're fucking cancering yourself up. Yeah. So, [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6812.719999999999s)]
*  yeah. Hey, I hope you guys all joined. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6818.16s)]
*  I'm a huge arm, cherry big, big fan. I find that hard to believe, but thank you. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6823.36s)]
*  Between day seven, uh, [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6827.599999999999s)]
*  Lori Gottlieb and like Anna Kendrick are probably listening to one of those [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6830.32s)]
*  every month. Oh my God. I love those episodes. Thank you. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6833.5599999999995s)]
*  Is there an episode that people tell you that was like the most impactful to [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6836.639999999999s)]
*  them that you hear the most often? [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6840.44s)]
*  Yeah. Day seven, certainly one of those. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6843.12s)]
*  That one's hard for me to receive that compliment probably for obvious reasons. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6845.36s)]
*  Yeah. Um, but, um, my mom, [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6849.759999999999s)]
*  I interviewed my mom and that's one that people constantly bring up. Yeah. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6853.16s)]
*  Cause she told her whole story completely shame free [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6857.719999999999s)]
*  and honestly, and it was awesome. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6862.759999999999s)]
*  And there were even moments cause my mom's super duper open and I, [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6866.24s)]
*  we have great, great communication, [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6870.0s)]
*  but even something about putting the interviewer hat on, [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6872.32s)]
*  I found myself getting curious about things I had never asked her. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6875.88s)]
*  And then I got some kind of profound answers that blew me [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6880.04s)]
*  away. Like one was, which I had never thought to ask her. I'm like, [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6884.84s)]
*  how could someone like you who's so brave and confident have been with [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6890.4800000000005s)]
*  someone like Greg who was beating you? [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6895.4800000000005s)]
*  That seems so disjointed from my idea of who you are. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6899.16s)]
*  And she said, well, I had just gotten divorced from your dad. I met Greg. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6904.08s)]
*  I got married too soon. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6908.639999999999s)]
*  My family was already completely disappointed in me that the first marriage failed. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6910.96s)]
*  And I just thought, here I am again. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6915.68s)]
*  And the shame of admitting I failed the second time is worse than getting [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6920.08s)]
*  hit. And I was like, Oh, [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6925.84s)]
*  and shame, boy. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6930.44s)]
*  Talk about the thing that is the most powerful. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6931.92s)]
*  Like y'all get my ass kicked instead of feeling the shame of failure. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6934.96s)]
*  Yeah. So that was radical. I was like, Oh, I get it. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6940.32s)]
*  I didn't even know I was curious, but yeah, I was. I was like, how could you, [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6945.2s)]
*  you're not my stereotype of someone who ends up in that situation. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6949.32s)]
*  That actually leads into something I wanted to ask earlier. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6953.5199999999995s)]
*  You are fantastic on the podcast. I think oftentimes actors, [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6955.48s)]
*  the more we get to know them, the more we're like, [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6960.16s)]
*  there's not really a lot going on. It's kind of like, you have a void. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6968.759999999999s)]
*  Internally they have a void that we all see that is their personality. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6971.799999999999s)]
*  And I remember, I just re-listened to the episode with Gordon and he said, [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6977.2s)]
*  as soon as you started the podcast, this is what you need to be doing. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6980.48s)]
*  At what point are you like, Oh, this is what I, this is my lane. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6983.360000000001s)]
*  And I'm being validated for who I am. I want to know that whole, [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6987.68s)]
*  what are you're going through as that whole thing is happening. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6991.56s)]
*  Like you're starting the pod, you're realizing it's big. Oh, [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6993.96s)]
*  this is the moment. This is what I've made. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6996.56s)]
*  Let me own one of my previous judgments of Joe Rogan, [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=6998.360000000001s)]
*  which was, I remember him announcing he was never going to act again or host [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7002.96s)]
*  anything. He was just going to do his podcast. And I remember, because again, [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7007.68s)]
*  I'm insecure and I'm constantly thinking of what people think I'm failing or not [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7012.28s)]
*  failing. I remember thinking, you're just not getting the roles you want. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7016.92s)]
*  Right. I had that judgment of him. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7022.4s)]
*  And at some point in armchair expert, [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7025.24s)]
*  because there was a moment where I was on, [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7028.88s)]
*  I was a cast member of the ranch bless this mess and hosting top gear [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7030.8s)]
*  America and doing the podcast, which was way too much. It was bonkers. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7035.8s)]
*  And I was really happy as doing the podcast. And I, [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7040.879999999999s)]
*  I think my ego was like, again, [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7046.44s)]
*  cause I had made that judgment of, of, of Rogan, like, Oh, [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7049.839999999999s)]
*  if I quit acting, people are going to think I just failed out of it. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7052.92s)]
*  And at some point I realized the ranch, nobody sees this failure. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7056.92s)]
*  I'm going to let you know that right now. Be honest with you. Thank you. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7060.839999999999s)]
*  At some point I was like, no, I like this thing more. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7065.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't really care whether it looks like I have been kicked out of show [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7068.96s)]
*  business or not. And then also I totally believe Rogan a thousand percent. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7072.92s)]
*  And not like I was ever saying it out loud that that was the case, but like, [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7078.6s)]
*  yeah, I in my mind, I'm like, I owe that dude in a men's like I, I was wrong. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7082.52s)]
*  Of course he likes that more. It's so much better. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7087.34s)]
*  But I did have one moment that was really kind of interesting, [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7090.12s)]
*  which is Adam Grant, the sky I've had on like four times. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7093.88s)]
*  He's a Wharton psychologist, the professor there. And he writes all these, [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7096.44s)]
*  you know, New York times pieces and stuff. He's like a popular intellectual. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7100.759999999999s)]
*  I was telling him, you know, my whole story was, Oh, chips failed. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7104.839999999999s)]
*  I really didn't know what I was going to do. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7108.32s)]
*  I only wanted to write and direct and that wasn't on the table anymore. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7109.639999999999s)]
*  So then I started this just out of boredom. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7112.32s)]
*  And then my failure led to the greatest thing that happened to me. And he said, [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7114.12s)]
*  I wonder if it's as separate as you think it is. And I said, well, [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7119.24s)]
*  it's completely separate acting and writing and directing in a podcast. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7122.679999999999s)]
*  And he said, well, [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7126.36s)]
*  what was your favorite part of making TV shows and movies? And I was like, [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7126.8s)]
*  video village, video villages where the director sits and it's where the [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7133.32s)]
*  monitors are and it's where you'll go and watch playback after a scene. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7138.12s)]
*  And this is where all the actors and the creative people are gathered around [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7141.64s)]
*  these monitors and you're just shooting the shit. And I go, if I'm being honest, [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7145.0s)]
*  my favorite thing of show business is fucking video village. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7148.94s)]
*  I can be on set for 12 hours at video village, [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7151.6s)]
*  shooting the shit with other people that moved out of their little town to come [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7154.76s)]
*  here. I love that. And he goes, [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7157.6s)]
*  I think you just moved video village to your backyard because all the same [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7161.12s)]
*  people you wanted to talk to are now coming. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7164.52s)]
*  And now you don't have to do any of the other stuff. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7166.56s)]
*  You just isolated the thing you actually liked the most. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7168.2s)]
*  And now you're doing that part of it full time. And I was like, wow, [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7170.72s)]
*  maybe that is what happened. I wasn't calculating that or, [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7173.92s)]
*  or doing it intentionally, but it is kind of what happened. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7178.4400000000005s)]
*  It's funny you say video village, cause I also think part of your appeal. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7180.92s)]
*  And again, we, I think we see you as Hollywood, like, [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7184.0s)]
*  I don't say you lead as like a compliment, but like you're in that circle. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7186.64s)]
*  But to me, [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7189.64s)]
*  you're a guy who gets what most Americans are going through in a way that I [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7190.52s)]
*  think a lot of them pretend they do and do not. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7194.88s)]
*  And there's been times where you'll have very nuanced thoughts and you'll meet [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7198.12s)]
*  with resistance. The Jonathan Van Ness episode comes to mind, [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7200.92s)]
*  where you are being empathetic to what conservatives are feeling about trans [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7204.56s)]
*  issues, even if you don't agree with them. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7207.96s)]
*  And I think that is your superpower to us as like regular people, [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7210.0s)]
*  I think. Yeah. How is that dealing with maybe, you know, [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7215.0s)]
*  I think we have this idea that you need to have these certain beliefs to be in [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7219.4800000000005s)]
*  Hollywood or to be accepted in that circle. Is that tough for you to navigate? [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7223.080000000001s)]
*  Do you not care? [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7226.8s)]
*  Well, I care. I have my own opinions. And if you're at dinner with me, [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7228.320000000001s)]
*  you'll hear my opinions, political or otherwise, [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7232.040000000001s)]
*  but I have a much bigger mission with the podcast, [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7236.0s)]
*  which is I want young dudes to look at me and go like, [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7240.599999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, that guy rides wheelies on motorcycles. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7245.92s)]
*  And he talks about being molested and he talks about trauma and he talks about [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7248.32s)]
*  addiction and he's vulnerable. That's the main thrust. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7252.719999999999s)]
*  I don't care about my political opinions as much as I care about the dudes who've [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7258.719999999999s)]
*  come up to me and been like, I went to a meeting cause I listened to your show. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7263.32s)]
*  I've been sober 18 months. My brother's talking to me again. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7266.5599999999995s)]
*  Like those moments are insane to have someone come up to me and go like, [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7269.08s)]
*  I agree that politicians and asshole. Great. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7273.799999999999s)]
*  I am also like my own pride is like, [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7277.799999999999s)]
*  it's embarrassing to me that people are spouting off these opinions that half the [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7280.96s)]
*  country has. Whatever, whatever opinion you're popping off with, [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7285.639999999999s)]
*  guess what? 150 million people have that opinion. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7290.04s)]
*  It's not that fucking interesting or novel. It's boring as fuck. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7294.04s)]
*  It's the most pedestrian thing you'll say all day. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7298.52s)]
*  What you, your take on pizza is more interesting because it's probably more unique [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7301.6s)]
*  than 150 million people agree with you. So it's like, a it's fucking boring. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7306.0s)]
*  B everyone already does it. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7310.52s)]
*  I remember Stern getting like a lot of criticism that he wasn't, you know, [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7312.92s)]
*  getting really political when it was being called for. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7317.08s)]
*  And he's like, it's okay to have a place you go that you don't have to hear that [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7320.24s)]
*  shit. And for me, I made a commitment early on. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7324.68s)]
*  This isn't the place for that. There's, [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7329.56s)]
*  and if you want that guys turn to any other fucking station, you'll hear it. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7331.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. Well, [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7335.400000000001s)]
*  one thing you have is that as a much smaller subsection, [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7335.96s)]
*  people who have empathy for the other side's opinions, that is a very, [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7339.400000000001s)]
*  that's not 150 million people. I agree. I, I, [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7342.56s)]
*  the only political opinion I'm happy talking about in public is I [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7346.32s)]
*  do not believe half the country's bad. I just don't believe that. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7351.879999999999s)]
*  Forget what side I'm on. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7356.639999999999s)]
*  I don't believe half the country's evil or bad or wants the ruin of this [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7357.759999999999s)]
*  country. I think we have different opinions. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7362.28s)]
*  I think everyone probably wants the best for this place. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7365.04s)]
*  And then we have different opinions on how to get there. And guess what? [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7368.0s)]
*  Both sides are fucking wrong all the time. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7370.679999999999s)]
*  Both sides are, I have to remind the people in my bubble, like, yo, [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7373.719999999999s)]
*  we came up with communism. Got to remind you the liberals wanted communism. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7377.5599999999995s)]
*  This isn't a fucking, you know, we're all, we're all really fallible. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7382.88s)]
*  And I, I, [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7388.28s)]
*  I can't even be comfortable until I think I understand at least what [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7390.88s)]
*  your intention is. I'm, [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7395.84s)]
*  I need to understand why you feel that way or you're motivated [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7398.04s)]
*  that way. Cause the scariest thing to me is being around somebody that I don't [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7403.0s)]
*  understand that is unpredictable, that I can't predict how they're going to feel. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7406.8s)]
*  That to me scares me. So I just really need to know, [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7410.24s)]
*  what is it that you're latched onto here? That's emotional. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7414.68s)]
*  And generally if I take the time to do that, [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7418.12s)]
*  I force myself to make the argument that the other side would have. I go like, [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7420.4s)]
*  yeah, it's rational for them and from their point of view, [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7424.96s)]
*  and they're not bad. We're, we have a different opinion. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7428.6s)]
*  I just kind of, I reject that like half the country is this or that. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7431.72s)]
*  Yeah. How do you feel about the Jews? [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7437.16s)]
*  Love them. Love the Jews. Good answer. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7440.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7442.36s)]
*  Guys this has been Dax Shepard. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7442.5599999999995s)]
*  Love them the most. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7445.96s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQUmjrdbGU&t=7448.76s)]
