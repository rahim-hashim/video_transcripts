*  Magaluf the King Day, was this week, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2.96s)]
*  and the event was A-list. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5.46s)]
*  Schindler's, to be exact. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7.46s)]

*  Newsome. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=34.14s)]

*  if that's your bra size. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=40.68s)]

*  Melania was absolutely stunning. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=50.86s)]

*  You like that? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=75.62s)]
*  Yeah, I like that one. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=76.44s)]
*  I thought that, listen. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=77.28s)]
*  Son, I give you my heart, bro. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=78.12s)]

*  I give you my heart, bro. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=89.66s)]
*  I give you my heart, bro. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=92.1s)]
*  He got a little pussy. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=92.94s)]
*  He got a little pussy. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=93.78s)]
*  I got it, I got it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=94.61999999999999s)]
*  He got scared. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=95.46s)]
*  It was too much. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=96.3s)]
*  It was too much. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=97.11999999999999s)]
*  Doing it at a Jew makes it a little different. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=97.96s)]
*  Yeah, it makes it a little different. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=99.89999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=101.02s)]
*  Okay, so what do you guys think [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=101.86s)]
*  of Elon having his little spastic moment? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=102.69999999999999s)]
*  I don't, isn't this like a super pro-Israel administration? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=105.53999999999999s)]
*  I just don't think they hate Jews like that. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=109.02s)]
*  Oh, no, no. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=111.44s)]
*  Let's clarify something. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=112.56s)]
*  I think he's just autistic. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=113.84s)]
*  Yeah, they don't hate Jews at all. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=114.8s)]
*  If it was anti-black, maybe we got a thing. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=117.72s)]
*  South African, but anti-Jew, they're like a big pro. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=119.64s)]
*  No, no, I don't think he was actually doing it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=122.44s)]
*  Here's the shit that annoys me. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  And this is what Democrats do all the fucking time. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=128.8s)]
*  They just defend absurd shit, and that's what exhausts us. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=130.48s)]
*  I think that's why the trans thing is a big issue. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=134.16s)]
*  I don't even think anybody gives a fuck about trans. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=135.68s)]
*  It's just the most absurd and obvious thing. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=137.7s)]
*  And I feel people are going like, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=140.4s)]
*  well, you'll acknowledge this is weird. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=141.92s)]
*  Trans girls competing against normal girls, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=144.51999999999998s)]
*  that's a little unfair, and they won't even acknowledge it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=146.48s)]
*  So, we probably just gotta go, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=148.84s)]
*  yo, that was some goofy shit he did. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=150.04s)]
*  We can't let him out in front of people. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=153.16s)]
*  He spends all day in a basement working on electricity. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=154.72s)]
*  You let him out in front of people, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=157.6s)]
*  he gets really excited. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=158.79999999999998s)]
*  He does whatever the last documentary he saw was. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=159.92s)]
*  He just got shit in his head, and it comes out. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=162.2s)]
*  But you gotta at least say it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=166.24s)]
*  It's goofy as fuck and weird as fuck. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=167.32s)]
*  Just say it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=168.92s)]
*  It was a Roman salute, bro. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=169.76s)]
*  Yes, Roman salute. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=171.04s)]
*  That's absurd. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=172.28s)]
*  It was Roman. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=173.12s)]
*  That's absurd. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=173.96s)]
*  You guys don't know history. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=174.8s)]
*  You guys don't know anything about history. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=175.8s)]
*  Tell me about the Romans. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=177.52s)]
*  The Romans killed a lot of Jews. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=178.48s)]
*  Okay, that is like their main mission. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=180.08s)]
*  Specifically. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=181.96s)]
*  One main Jew, he killed a king Jew, all right? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=182.8s)]
*  King Jew, son. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=185.2s)]
*  Okay, so what do you think? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=186.84s)]
*  You think he's a... [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=188.36s)]
*  Yeah, you never did that for me, bro. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=189.32s)]
*  Yeah, that's true, dog. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=191.2s)]
*  You never did that for me, bro. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=194.04s)]
*  Let's go, dude, come on now. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=195.36s)]
*  Trump's America. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=196.64s)]
*  I feel a way. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=197.48s)]
*  Trump's America. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=198.32s)]
*  He's clapping for you to fix something else on his boardroom. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=199.16s)]
*  He's not clapping to applaud you. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=201.39999999999998s)]
*  I take back my heart. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=202.32s)]

*  I'm having some fun with this. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=207.72s)]
*  I'm just saying, if they gonna go that way, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=209.56s)]
*  then hey, I'm just giving my heart to everybody. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=211.6s)]

*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=214.51999999999998s)]
*  Are people saying that that's the thing [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=215.35999999999999s)]
*  that it becomes annoying. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=217.04s)]
*  Now you become like the Republican version of a Democrat. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=218.48s)]
*  By defending and being like, oh, it's a Roman. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=220.95999999999998s)]

*  with autism and you put him in front of a crowd [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=227.95999999999998s)]
*  and he just spazzed out. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=230.08s)]

*  The whole city, you can feel a buzz for sure. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=545.12s)]
*  And I'm looking, it's like, hey, Trump's base is youth. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=549.6800000000001s)]
*  It feels like it's probably a little bit more diverse. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=551.88s)]
*  DC wasn't. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=554.2s)]
*  I never seen DC this not black in my life. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=555.32s)]

*  selling the Donald Trump merch to the white people. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=560.48s)]
*  That's all I saw. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=563.76s)]
*  The auto rickshaws, they got the petty caps. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=564.6800000000001s)]
*  They're always playing music in Times Square, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=568.24s)]

*  but just like, you're stopped at lights, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=576.6800000000001s)]
*  you see all these people with [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=578.28s)]
*  Donald motherfucking Trump shirts on or whatever. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=580.68s)]
*  The vibe is crazy. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=583.52s)]
*  We're watching in a hotel [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=584.9599999999999s)]
*  and you can hear people fucking screaming [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=586.8399999999999s)]
*  and clapping when Donald Trump is showing on camera. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=589.3199999999999s)]
*  It was like, I haven't seen white people this happy [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=591.24s)]
*  in my entire life. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=593.92s)]
*  It was a thing. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=595.4s)]
*  It was a real fucking thing. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=596.68s)]
*  Did you go to any of the events? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=598.12s)]
*  No, I got asked to go to the Starlight Gala, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=599.68s)]
*  but it was like, I didn't have a suit. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=604.12s)]
*  It was a black tie affair. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=605.76s)]
*  I got asked like two hours before. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=606.72s)]
*  I was like, it's just not worth all that effort. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=608.56s)]
*  But being in DC, it was actually pretty cool [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=609.9599999999999s)]
*  to just see the energy. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=612.28s)]
*  The energy around it. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=614.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=615.0s)]

*  But also I didn't know if I wanted to be in there. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=616.68s)]
*  It is for politics. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=618.52s)]
*  People who dedicate their life to politics [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=619.36s)]
*  thinks that's the only thing going on. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=620.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's really funny. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=622.5999999999999s)]
*  And that is their moment. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=623.4399999999999s)]
*  That's the event. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=624.9599999999999s)]
*  And you realize how politically invested people are [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=625.8s)]
*  when you see just like every loser on both sides. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=628.64s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=631.8399999999999s)]
*  So this is a bigger night than like, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=632.68s)]
*  what's when they're running [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=634.48s)]
*  and they have, when they finally choose [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=636.04s)]
*  who's gonna be the running mate for that particular party. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=638.28s)]
*  Oh, the convention. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=640.4s)]
*  The Democratic or Republican. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=641.64s)]
*  Isn't that a bigger night? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=642.48s)]
*  Because they won. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=643.3199999999999s)]
*  It was bigger. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=644.16s)]
*  This is the celebration. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=645.0s)]
*  Yes, the Super Bowl parade. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=646.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=647.64s)]
*  And you get to look at all the losers. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=648.48s)]
*  The losers gotta show up. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=649.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=651.1999999999999s)]
*  Imagine your victory parade. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=652.24s)]
*  The losers gotta be on the float with you. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=653.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=656.24s)]
*  That would be way better. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=657.0799999999999s)]
*  How incredible would that be? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=658.0799999999999s)]
*  They gotta see all your fans throwing you bud lights. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=660.0s)]
*  They catch one, you go, I'll take that. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=662.64s)]
*  You know, who you're celebrating. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=664.44s)]
*  Like it is a pretty intense moment. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=666.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=668.0s)]
*  It's good for Biden, he ain't know where he was, so. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=668.84s)]
*  Oh yeah, that was so weird. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=670.96s)]
*  He thought he was being inaugurated. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=672.6s)]
*  There was moments where he was like, we did it. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=674.6s)]
*  He's like, let's run this back. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=675.9200000000001s)]
*  You notice how often they didn't stand up? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=678.2800000000001s)]
*  Trump is getting standing ovations. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=680.48s)]
*  It's a little like a nauseating happening there again. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=681.7600000000001s)]
*  But Trump and, I'm sorry, Biden and Kamala only stood once. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=683.5600000000001s)]
*  When he said the peace treaty [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=687.0400000000001s)]
*  between Palestine and Gaza or whatever, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=688.12s)]
*  that's the only time he stood up. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=690.32s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=691.72s)]
*  Every other time there's a season. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=692.7600000000001s)]
*  Did you hear people booing? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=693.64s)]
*  I saw clips of people like outside booing [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=694.72s)]
*  every time like Obama went on screen [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=696.64s)]
*  or like the Clintons or anything like that. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=698.6s)]
*  I think, I wanna say there was one or two boos, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=699.9200000000001s)]
*  but like we were watching on like a 10 second delayed feed. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=701.6s)]
*  So you would hear people in the hotel, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=704.12s)]
*  we were at the Grand Hyatt Hotel. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=705.52s)]
*  You'd hear the lobby going crazy, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=706.88s)]
*  and then you would know Trump's about to get shown. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=708.24s)]
*  They didn't really give a fuck about vans or any of that. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=711.4s)]
*  But Trump, that's, let's go. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=712.9200000000001s)]
*  Well, I think they moved it indoors because of the weather. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=714.64s)]
*  Yeah, it was freezing. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=717.08s)]
*  Yeah, so it was in like, I guess the rotunda. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=717.96s)]
*  And then all the people [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=720.84s)]
*  that were gonna go watch it outside [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=722.52s)]
*  went and watched it from, I guess it was the Capital One arena. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=723.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=726.48s)]
*  So they had it displayed at the Capital One arena. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=727.32s)]
*  So they had to move everybody's tickets around, et cetera. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=730.0s)]
*  So I think that's what you were hearing with the boos. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=732.4s)]
*  It was in the arena. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=735.28s)]
*  I believe when they show Obama doing the walk to the rotunda, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=736.12s)]
*  there might've been some people in the, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=740.5600000000001s)]
*  and by some I mean a significant portion of the people. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=743.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=745.84s)]

*  It is a thing. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=754.72s)]
*  Well, I mean, we didn't make it a thing. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=755.56s)]
*  We didn't make it a thing. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=758.0s)]
*  I feel like you guys alone are gonna make this trend this popular [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=758.84s)]
*  if you keep on doing it on this podcast. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=762.72s)]
*  Yeah, I was just saying. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=764.48s)]
*  How long until it's an emoji? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=766.08s)]
*  It's gotta be an emoji, too. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=769.0s)]
*  Tim Cook was at that inauguration, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=770.16s)]
*  it might be an emoji tomorrow. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=771.6s)]
*  He's like, I've got an idea. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=772.6s)]

*  That guy going crazy. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=786.4s)]
*  He thinks he's being slick [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=787.28s)]
*  like he's cheating on a test with this. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=788.1199999999999s)]
*  I know. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=789.56s)]
*  I used to think that shit worked too. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=790.4s)]
*  Nah, man. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=792.3599999999999s)]
*  That is crazy right there. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=793.5999999999999s)]
*  You know, the smile on Zuck's face afterward [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=796.3199999999999s)]
*  is the funniest part. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=798.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he's like. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=798.92s)]
*  He sees him, smiles, goes back. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=799.76s)]
*  So much joy. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=801.3599999999999s)]
*  Just so happy. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=802.4s)]
*  I mean, this is what he made Facebook for. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=803.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's true. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=805.4399999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=806.28s)]
*  It's this exact purpose. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=807.1199999999999s)]
*  That's very true. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=807.9599999999999s)]
*  Just rating hot chicks. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=808.8s)]
*  I'm gonna give you a hand, dude. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=809.68s)]
*  What'd you think of all the billionaires all lined up? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=810.76s)]
*  You had like Bezos, Zuckerberg, Musk. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=812.72s)]
*  All this junk. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=816.0s)]
*  So this is what was cool to watch the pod, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=816.84s)]
*  the stream with all in guys, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=817.68s)]
*  because they're so fucking smart. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=818.64s)]
*  Like just seeing their reactions. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=819.72s)]
*  Immediately they were like, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=821.3199999999999s)]
*  this is them, their way of saying, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=822.76s)]
*  hey, America's back to innovation, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=825.3199999999999s)]
*  back to like rewarding greatness and all that stuff. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=827.12s)]
*  Like having the Apple CEO, the Google CEO. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=830.4399999999999s)]
*  Hey, look at America. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=833.0s)]
*  Look what we can do and look what we reward. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=833.96s)]
*  It was like, they felt like that was like [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=835.56s)]
*  an intentional thing. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=836.88s)]
*  I could see that. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=839.2s)]
*  I could see that argument. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=840.04s)]
*  I also think it's like, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=840.96s)]
*  Donald is all about optics. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=842.76s)]
*  Optics are very important. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=845.0s)]
*  I think having the most powerful people in America [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=846.04s)]
*  stand behind you and come kiss the ring [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=849.96s)]
*  for your inauguration. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=852.2s)]
*  I think there's like an ego stroke. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=854.0s)]
*  It lets everybody know, hey, I'm king. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=856.04s)]
*  You think these tech guys are the kings. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=858.12s)]
*  You think they run the country. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=860.12s)]
*  No, they're here for daddy. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=861.72s)]
*  These guys are talking shit about me a few years ago. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=863.44s)]
*  He made his wife get dressed up. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=866.4s)]
*  Dress your wife up. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=868.6s)]
*  That's what he said, yo, put your wife in something nice. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=870.8399999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna sit her next to this dog. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=872.6s)]
*  To me, it's on some, I'm the king [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=876.1999999999999s)]
*  and everybody else is here to support the king. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=878.7199999999999s)]
*  Now, I do agree that they're the optics, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=881.7199999999999s)]
*  what they said, which is like, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=884.52s)]
*  this is what we reward here [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=886.36s)]
*  and these are the people we support 100%. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=887.64s)]
*  I mean, they're very specific about the people [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=889.88s)]
*  that they put there. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=891.4s)]
*  But I wonder if the Bezos and the Zuckerbergs [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=892.24s)]
*  are like honored about being there. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=894.04s)]
*  But it does show that they're kind of being phony [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=896.2s)]
*  because four years ago when they're pushing back [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=898.36s)]
*  against the administration [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=901.72s)]
*  and I don't know how much pushback they specifically did, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=902.88s)]
*  but they seem to like acquiesce to like liberal leanings, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=905.8s)]
*  at least within their companies. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=909.8s)]
*  And the second, it looks like the country [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=911.36s)]
*  is switching the other way. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=913.16s)]
*  Maybe like the real version of them came out. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=915.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=917.24s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=918.08s)]
*  I don't know if it's the real version, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=918.92s)]
*  it's just, hey, we with the winning team. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=919.74s)]
*  So here's the thing, here's the thing. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=921.32s)]
*  Because I bet you if the pendulum swings back, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=922.16s)]
*  I can't fathom that like titans of industry [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=924.56s)]
*  are also cocks. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=929.12s)]
*  What? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=931.36s)]
*  Are you serious? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=932.1999999999999s)]
*  They might be cocks, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=933.88s)]
*  but they're about their money more than anything. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=934.72s)]
*  Yeah, like, do you know how Zuckerberg cocks Facebook? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=936.1999999999999s)]
*  They're cocks for money though. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=938.72s)]
*  So like wherever the money [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=940.64s)]
*  and wherever what's best for my business, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=941.96s)]
*  I'm gonna cuck out. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=944.28s)]
*  Right, right, right, right, right. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=945.1999999999999s)]
*  Okay, okay, okay, let me just clarify that statement. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=946.04s)]
*  Is what they actually feel deep down is like, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=949.16s)]
*  what's a 40 hour work week? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=953.04s)]
*  Like I worked 100 hours a week. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=955.16s)]
*  Why do I have to pay you more money for overtime? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=956.76s)]
*  They're like, I get, I grind, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=959.28s)]
*  like their actual ideas are more conservative. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=960.84s)]
*  Outside of like gay marriage and that kind of shit, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=963.64s)]
*  but like work, hustle, grind, right? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=965.2s)]
*  And that would triumph any social justice shit they feel. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=968.64s)]
*  That would trump it. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=971.32s)]
*  So the idea of them hiring somebody not based on like merit [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=972.16s)]
*  or who they think is the best, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=975.56s)]
*  like if you ask any of those guys, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=977.16s)]

*  and doesn't put his hand on it. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=1927.62s)]
*  And then her hat was blocking it so he couldn't see it. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=1928.4599999999998s)]

*  mop up all this shit and nobody making money [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=1984.28s)]

*  Okay, that's interesting. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=1998.9199999999998s)]
*  And if you're one of those people, [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=1999.76s)]
*  take advantage of illegals. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2001.28s)]
*  Oh. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2002.9199999999998s)]
*  Before they kick them all out. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2004.12s)]
*  There's a very small window [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2005.9599999999998s)]
*  where you can use them almost as fleas. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2007.9199999999998s)]
*  45 more minutes. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2009.32s)]

*  No, no, I don't know. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2012.76s)]
*  It just feels like a lot of legislation's gonna come down [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2013.6s)]
*  and then people who got money are gonna run it the fuck up. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2016.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2019.9199999999998s)]
*  I'm actually surprised to see if mortgage rates come down. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2021.6s)]
*  I don't think they will. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2023.24s)]
*  Because they gotta do something to combat inflation, right? [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2024.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I also feel like we've been overdue [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2027.28s)]
*  for a recession for a long time, so a recession might hit. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2028.78s)]
*  And if you- [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2031.8s)]

*  I mean, I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2033.48s)]
*  you signed an executive order just saying [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2035.52s)]
*  all departments just need to handle the home crisis. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2037.52s)]
*  Like the housing crisis. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2041.76s)]
*  Like no specifics, it's just fix it. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2043.36s)]
*  Fix it. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2046.1999999999998s)]
*  You know how you fix the housing crisis? [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2047.04s)]
*  To be honest with you, how? [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2048.8399999999997s)]
*  You made more houses. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2049.94s)]
*  Right? [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2051.02s)]
*  It's just like, this is him to his real estate home. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2051.86s)]
*  He's like, yo, run it up, go build. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2054.7400000000002s)]
*  Also, we're gonna get some illegals out of their houses, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2056.7000000000003s)]
*  so that'll open up some space. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2058.7000000000003s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2060.54s)]
*  No, they don't take up that much space. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2061.38s)]
*  That's the thing about illegals. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2062.2000000000003s)]
*  I will say that. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2063.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2064.06s)]
*  They be mobbing up in one house. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2064.9s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2065.94s)]
*  I'm not really tripping on that. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2066.78s)]
*  They're efficient. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2067.82s)]
*  They are. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2068.6600000000003s)]

*  A lot. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2073.2200000000003s)]
*  No, actually, before we do that, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2074.06s)]
*  can we talk a little bit about this Biden pardon situation? [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2074.88s)]
*  Sure. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2078.38s)]

*  I'm gonna tell you why right now, okay? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2086.2s)]
*  Because Biden pardoned his family, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2087.7599999999998s)]
*  which I get, I would've done that shit. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2089.8799999999997s)]
*  I would've done it. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2091.48s)]
*  1000%. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2092.3199999999997s)]
*  Even though, and listen, you're a politician, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2093.14s)]
*  you've been doing politics for like 60 years [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2094.3199999999997s)]
*  or however long he's been doing politics. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2096.56s)]
*  Like, by the nature of the game, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2097.9599999999996s)]
*  you've done some illegal corrupt things. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2100.2s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2102.0s)]
*  Okay? [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2102.8399999999997s)]
*  That's how your family gets rich. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2103.66s)]
*  Maybe the money isn't sent directly to you. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2105.48s)]
*  Maybe it's sent to your brother. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2107.68s)]
*  Maybe it's sent to your cousin. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2108.88s)]

*  that can't exist. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2134.06s)]

*  And you're like, I feel like you might be concerned, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2137.4s)]

*  I had a hard time breathing [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2671.24s)]
*  because I was going through some fertility situations. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2673.2799999999997s)]
*  Or so you thought. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2675.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2676.4s)]
*  But you think it was actually the vaccine? [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2677.24s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2678.3199999999997s)]
*  Could've been the Fauci outing, bro. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2679.16s)]
*  But that knows it had to be the vaccine. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2680.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2680.8199999999997s)]
*  Because I should be able to breathe. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2681.66s)]
*  I used to tell myself that. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2682.5s)]
*  You know what's funny? [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2683.3399999999997s)]
*  When I would have a hard time breathing, [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2684.2s)]
*  I'd be like, for what? [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2685.2799999999997s)]
*  Like. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2686.82s)]
*  I'd just go, for what? [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2688.02s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2689.3s)]
*  Come on, man. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2690.14s)]
*  My heart goes out to your nose, man. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2692.26s)]
*  That's double down bad. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2694.06s)]
*  Yeah, that's fine. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2697.82s)]
*  Yo, my heart goes down. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2699.5s)]
*  What do you mean, my heart goes out is just a bad thing. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2700.7400000000002s)]
*  That's gonna become a bad thing. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2703.46s)]
*  Yeah, I never should've gave us that. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2704.78s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2706.1s)]
*  See, Eli can do no wrong, man. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2708.62s)]
*  Eli can do no wrong. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2710.58s)]
*  Eli's got parted. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2711.42s)]
*  His family got parted, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2712.2400000000002s)]
*  and then Trump parted all the January 6 people. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2713.08s)]
*  He gotta do that. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2715.52s)]
*  I mean, he said he was going to, so. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2717.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's why he's gotta do it. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2718.84s)]
*  And you gotta do it optics-wise. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2719.68s)]
*  You can't leave them in there. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2721.24s)]
*  If you said that they weren't doing anything wrong. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2722.08s)]
*  But they said it was case by case. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2724.2s)]
*  Then he just was like, no. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2726.12s)]
*  Yeah, initially he was like, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2727.84s)]
*  if you did violent crime, if you attacked a cop, [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2728.88s)]
*  we gotta look at that, da da da. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2731.0s)]
*  And then now it looks like they're all good. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2732.6s)]
*  I mean, they were doing it for him, so he couldn't not. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2734.2s)]
*  But yeah, they should stay in jail. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2736.64s)]
*  Son, officer died. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2738.16s)]
*  Oh, we care about. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2741.2s)]
*  It was vaccine-related. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2742.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2743.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2744.62s)]
*  Nah, but come on. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2745.8199999999997s)]
*  Some people actually did violent shit. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2746.66s)]
*  Not everybody should have been. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2749.02s)]
*  I think they should all stay locked up. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2749.98s)]
*  I think, actually, there was the one thing [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2751.9399999999996s)]
*  I didn't push back on when Trump was like, [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2753.7s)]
*  when Iran tried to kill him. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2755.8599999999997s)]
*  Are you a patriot or not, bro? [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2756.7s)]
*  Do you want me to like him or not? [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2759.62s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2760.9399999999996s)]
*  Nah, Trump's America, bro. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2761.7799999999997s)]
*  What do you believe? [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2762.62s)]
*  I'm just trying to save my life. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2763.46s)]
*  You're hopping back and forth. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2764.2799999999997s)]
*  I said too many crazy things earlier. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2765.12s)]
*  So I gotta get back on a good side. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2766.7799999999997s)]
*  Hey, I'm sure they'll like you. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2768.7s)]
*  Hey, there's a way you can get them to like you. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2770.18s)]
*  I'm Herschel Walker, man. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2773.52s)]
*  I'm one of the cool-ups. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2774.8399999999997s)]
*  It is very easy for the Republicans to like you, though. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2776.16s)]
*  Yeah, you just gotta tap dance. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2782.2s)]
*  No, you know what I mean? [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2783.68s)]
*  Maybe they're way more accepting than Democrats. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2787.44s)]
*  That is true. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2790.64s)]
*  Like, all you need to do. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2791.48s)]
*  They'll forgive you easier. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2792.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, like, all you need to do. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2793.68s)]
*  Democrats take fucking blue-haired weird bitches. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2794.96s)]
*  We are accepting as fuck. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2797.72s)]
*  But if they say one thing you don't like, [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2798.56s)]
*  or if you say one thing about them blue-haired weird bitches, [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2799.88s)]
*  fuck you, how dare you say that thing? [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2802.18s)]
*  Elon said let H1 be, and they said, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2804.54s)]
*  yo, get the fuck out and go back to Africa. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2806.7799999999997s)]
*  This is gonna take. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2808.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, but that is fire. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2810.14s)]
*  That's crazy. Telling him is fire. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2810.98s)]
*  Because you wanna say that very often, but you can't. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2815.02s)]
*  Finally have that moment where you can say, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2818.06s)]
*  yo, go back to fucking Africa. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2819.8999999999996s)]
*  They can't just say everything, either. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2822.58s)]
*  Nah, we need to hear Elon with that. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2824.1s)]
*  If he comes on the pod, we gotta send his ass back to Africa. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2825.58s)]
*  All right, but this is what I'm saying is that [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2828.66s)]
*  for so long, I think Republicans have had this kind of [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2830.6s)]
*  victim or outsider mentality. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2835.2s)]
*  So they've been made to feel like their views are absurd [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2837.68s)]
*  and bigoted and racist or toxic or radioactive, right? [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2841.64s)]
*  So anybody who validates their views, they accept. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2845.72s)]
*  And they're willing to overlook a lot of other fuck shit. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2852.08s)]
*  Whereas Democrats have become the norm, right? [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2855.92s)]
*  And whatever they believed is what you should believe [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2859.74s)]
*  as a good person. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2863.3399999999997s)]
*  So the second you veer off from what they believe, [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2865.22s)]
*  now you're not a good person, and now we're gonna finger [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2868.2999999999997s)]
*  wag and tell you how fucked up you are. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2870.4199999999996s)]
*  So you can make the argument that the Republicans [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2872.22s)]
*  are way more accepting. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2874.1s)]
*  They're the ones, Democrats are the ones pulling up [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2875.54s)]
*  old tweets. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2877.18s)]
*  Oh, he said this thing. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2878.2999999999997s)]
*  How dare he? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2879.8599999999997s)]
*  There are people who hate fucking Trump, [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2880.7s)]
*  now they like Trump. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2882.74s)]
*  The Trump people are like, yeah, what's up, come on in. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2883.9199999999996s)]
*  We love you. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2886.58s)]
*  Great, welcome. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2887.4399999999996s)]
*  Now, I don't know if they're better people, [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2888.7999999999997s)]
*  but it's a smarter play. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2890.6s)]
*  It's a much smarter play than, no, you said this thing [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2892.04s)]
*  we don't like, fuck you. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2894.92s)]
*  You're not welcome. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2896.3599999999997s)]
*  But now this is actually good for Democrats [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2897.2s)]
*  because they realize they don't have everybody anymore. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2899.14s)]
*  They're not the dominant cultural force. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2901.2s)]
*  So they gotta sit down and be like, shit, [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2903.3999999999996s)]
*  we were ostracizing people, people left us. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2905.48s)]
*  Man, we need to be a little bit more forgiving, [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2908.18s)]
*  a little bit more accepting. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2909.7599999999998s)]
*  Now the Republicans are the dominant cultural force. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2911.0s)]
*  They could be a little bit more discerning [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2913.6s)]
*  with who they accept. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2915.52s)]
*  They might go, now you can't just believe in one thing [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2917.02s)]
*  and get to ride with us. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2920.18s)]
*  You better believe in all these things [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2921.54s)]
*  and get to ride with us. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2923.72s)]
*  You saw, they kicked out Vivek. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2924.56s)]
*  So what do you think happened there? [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2926.26s)]
*  I think he tweeted that shit that really upset [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2928.18s)]
*  their far right-wing fan base, which was like, [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2930.7s)]
*  remember when everybody's upset about H1B [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2932.94s)]
*  and he basically was like, that's y'all's fault. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2935.26s)]
*  Americans teach our kids not to work hard. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2937.02s)]
*  You've like, we're soft. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2939.7s)]
*  He basically said Americans weren't exceptional. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2940.54s)]
*  Yeah, we're soft. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2942.3s)]
*  And the base turned on him. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2943.14s)]
*  Yeah, and I think that's when they were like, [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2943.96s)]
*  nah, we can't have that. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2946.3599999999997s)]
*  Now this is very not- [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2947.2s)]
*  And he doesn't own X. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2948.04s)]
*  So we can lose that guy. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2949.52s)]
*  But this is very not Trump-like. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2951.0s)]
*  Because Trump usually rides hard [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2953.24s)]
*  for the people who've supported him. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2956.4399999999996s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2958.64s)]
*  Who does true? [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2959.48s)]
*  Like it's very rare for him to exile somebody. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2960.2999999999997s)]
*  I think I also heard one rumbling that him and Elon weren't. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2962.52s)]
*  Elon was getting annoyed with him. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2965.4399999999996s)]
*  And then Elon just won that, get him out of here. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2966.6s)]
*  So I heard a take. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2968.56s)]
*  I don't know if he wants his- [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2971.9199999999996s)]
*  Vivek was like, yo, stop showing me your heart, bro. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2973.24s)]
*  He's like, it's constant. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2976.66s)]
*  No, but they were not happy with that tweet. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2977.5s)]
*  If you'll notice Vivek stopped tweeting after that. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2979.3799999999997s)]
*  He went radio silent. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2982.4199999999996s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2983.58s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, just look back. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2984.4199999999996s)]
*  We didn't see him tweeting a bunch of crazy shit. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2985.54s)]
*  We didn't see him blah, blah, blah. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2987.8999999999996s)]
*  They were like, put a fucking, cut it out. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2989.2999999999997s)]
*  I heard a take, and this is, [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2992.58s)]
*  if he wants to say that it was his take, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2996.24s)]
*  he's more than welcome to. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2998.94s)]
*  But he thinks that Vivek was pushed out [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=2999.8599999999997s)]
*  because Vivek actually wants to make change. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3003.54s)]
*  So Vivek actually wants to make radical change. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3006.96s)]
*  Like when he came on the pod, [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3009.82s)]
*  the exact things that he was saying, [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3010.8s)]
*  I wanna slash 50% of the people working in the FBI [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3012.52s)]
*  or 50% of the people working here. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3015.6s)]
*  And they believe that Elon doesn't really care [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3017.2s)]
*  that much about making change. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3021.84s)]
*  He cares more about executing the tasks at hand [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3024.08s)]
*  that would benefit him. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3027.84s)]
*  So Vivek is, and if you remember on the pod, [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3030.08s)]
*  Vivek is a radical. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3033.66s)]
*  Now, if you really truly believe in his philosophy, [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3035.04s)]
*  he's radically different than what the norm is right now, [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3039.2599999999998s)]
*  but you might think that that radical belief [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3042.3599999999997s)]
*  is the best possible thing for the country. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3044.72s)]
*  And it's very interesting, charming, and exciting [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3046.92s)]
*  when you hear what he has to say. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3051.42s)]
*  But if he came in with that energy, [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3053.56s)]
*  like yeah, we're actually gonna do it. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3056.16s)]
*  We're gonna drain the swamp. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3057.3599999999997s)]
*  We're gonna get rid of this bureaucracy. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3058.72s)]
*  We're gonna remove the Manjaro class. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3060.24s)]
*  And then some other people are like, [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3062.2799999999997s)]
*  well, we need some Manjaro class. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3064.3199999999997s)]
*  We need some bureaucracy. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3066.04s)]
*  Like, we can't totally remove it. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3067.4799999999996s)]
*  And he was like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3069.0s)]
*  The only way we can do this is by removing it completely. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3071.16s)]
*  It's a cancerous tumor. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3075.12s)]
*  If you leave any in there, it just grows. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3076.52s)]
*  So we gotta leave it all out. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3078.64s)]
*  And then they go, but that's too risky. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3080.3599999999997s)]
*  What if it doesn't work out? [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3082.56s)]
*  And he's like, I'm willing for it to not work out. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3083.52s)]
*  I'm willing to do that experiment. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3085.72s)]
*  And they go, we can't risk the Republican Party failing [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3087.16s)]
*  because of your experiment. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3091.6s)]
*  See you later. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3093.96s)]
*  So maybe he has to prove it on a state level. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3094.92s)]
*  Maybe he has to go to Ohio and do that exact thing [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3097.04s)]
*  and prove that it works. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3099.36s)]
*  And then he can execute that at the federal level. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3100.68s)]
*  Isn't that the place when he was campaigning [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3103.36s)]
*  and there was like multiple people who said, [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3106.04s)]
*  I won't vote for him because he's brown? [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3108.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3110.2799999999997s)]
*  Brown or because he was a Punjabi, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3112.08s)]
*  because he's a Hindu. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3114.16s)]
*  I think it was Hindu. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3116.08s)]
*  Same. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3116.92s)]
*  Same. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3117.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, I thought it was about believing in Jesus. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3119.2799999999997s)]
*  Cause the guy, they kept going like, [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3122.12s)]
*  well, do you believe Jesus is your Lord and Savior? [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3123.2799999999997s)]
*  He goes, I believe Jesus is a prophet [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3124.7999999999997s)]
*  or I believe he is a God or whatever, [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3127.68s)]
*  but I believe in many gods. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3129.2799999999997s)]
*  And they were like, nah, it's not good enough. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3130.36s)]
*  So now you're gonna go and try to run. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3132.36s)]
*  He's not gonna win. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3134.24s)]
*  And this is what's up. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3135.36s)]
*  Governor, you don't think he'll win governor of Ohio? [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3136.2s)]
*  I don't think he could win fucking comptroller of Ohio. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3138.16s)]
*  No way. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3141.44s)]
*  And I love Vivek. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3142.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm the guy that thinks he's great. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3143.12s)]
*  And I was very romanticized by what he said, [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3145.0s)]
*  but Ohio is Ohio. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3146.7599999999998s)]
*  They're not voting for that motherfucker. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3149.28s)]
*  I don't care if you're in the liberal ass Columbus, [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3150.12s)]
*  you ain't winning nothing. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3152.96s)]
*  I think he can win Ohio simply because if, [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3154.2000000000003s)]
*  if he continues having support for Trump, [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3157.7200000000003s)]
*  because remember when 50 was on a pod and he was like, [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3160.84s)]
*  listen, Eminem and Dr. Dre don't tour. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3165.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm the closest thing that they get [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3168.36s)]
*  to experiencing Eminem and Dr. Dre. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3171.2400000000002s)]
*  And he said that he felt like that helps him internationally [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3173.4s)]
*  when he's touring. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3176.52s)]
*  Like all those people that are also M fans [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3177.76s)]
*  and Dr. Dre fans, they get to almost experience [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3180.0s)]
*  that vicariously. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3182.76s)]
*  If Vivek stays incredibly close to the Trump campaign, [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3184.1600000000003s)]
*  incredibly close to Trump and Trump is shouting him out [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3187.6800000000003s)]
*  and he runs in Ohio, I believe the people of Ohio [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3190.44s)]
*  will be like, oh yeah, we get in Trump. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3192.84s)]
*  And I think they fuck with Trump. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3195.2000000000003s)]
*  I wonder if the Trump people know that and they're like, [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3196.0400000000004s)]
*  hey, we're not gonna like publicly kick you out. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3197.6400000000003s)]
*  Just be quiet and go run for governor [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3199.88s)]
*  and everything's cool. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3201.6800000000003s)]
*  See how that goes. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3202.5200000000004s)]
*  I think that might be it. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3203.88s)]
*  I hate that, he truly was about government efficiency. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3205.68s)]
*  If you have a department of government efficiency, [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3209.8399999999997s)]
*  that was the drum he beat the loudest. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3212.44s)]
*  He was the number one guy for that. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3214.8799999999997s)]
*  So kicking him out before the term even starts, [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3216.8399999999997s)]
*  I took away a lot of hope I had for cutting, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3221.44s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3476.1800000000003s)]

*  Two sexes or two genders? [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3479.7400000000002s)]
*  I think it's two genders. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3481.7400000000002s)]
*  He said sexes and then uses gender [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3483.58s)]
*  within the text of it. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3485.5s)]
*  I think it's two genders. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3488.1000000000004s)]
*  It's the same thing as sex with gender [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3490.06s)]
*  within the text of it. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3491.38s)]
*  Yo, here's my thing about that. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3492.5s)]
*  It's like, and people are like, [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3493.86s)]
*  oh, this is transphobic, it's like, [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3495.98s)]
*  but don't the trans just wanna be two genders? [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3497.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3501.58s)]
*  So he's not saying you can't be trans. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3503.06s)]
*  You could be a trans man or a trans woman. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3506.5s)]
*  Yeah, once you transition, you are that. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3508.94s)]
*  You can't be the in-between shit. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3510.46s)]
*  Well, we are gender affirming. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3512.02s)]
*  That's actually gender affirming, to be honest with you. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3513.1s)]
*  Yeah, this is very progressive. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3514.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3515.3s)]
*  Very progressive. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3516.14s)]
*  That's his most progressive policy, [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3516.98s)]
*  if you think about it. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3517.82s)]
*  Yeah, this is the clip. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3518.64s)]
*  As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3520.44s)]
*  of the United States government [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3525.2s)]
*  that there are only two genders, male and female. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3526.8s)]
*  That's progressive, though. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3531.52s)]
*  Standing up. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3533.08s)]
*  He is progressive. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3533.92s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta stand up for something that progressive. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3535.2400000000002s)]
*  So then the trans women could participate in sports? [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3538.36s)]
*  What other? [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3542.2400000000002s)]
*  Nah, those trans women are women, Al, you fucking bigot. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3543.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3546.44s)]
*  So they can... [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3547.44s)]
*  Why would they not? [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3548.68s)]
*  They're women. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3549.52s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3550.3599999999997s)]
*  No, no, they can't participate in sports. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3551.2s)]
*  Yeah, I thought we was gonna say that. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3553.04s)]
*  Duncan with an Adam's apple. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3553.8799999999997s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3555.2s)]
*  No, you can't participate in sports. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3556.04s)]
*  But outside of that, they could be women. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3557.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah, we're on board with that, [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3559.2799999999997s)]
*  but the sports should chill, right? [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3560.92s)]
*  Yeah, obviously. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3563.7599999999998s)]
*  Okay, I just wanna make sure. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3564.72s)]
*  I'm trying to feel, yeah, y'all getting real cuckies [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3566.2s)]
*  around here. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3568.6s)]
*  Tables are turning. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3569.8799999999997s)]
*  Yo, I'm trying to think. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3570.72s)]
*  Yeah, I get it, yes. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3571.64s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know how you do the sports thing [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3572.48s)]
*  without also being like you're not a woman. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3574.0s)]
*  Some people can't do things. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3576.04s)]
*  Some people got asthma. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3577.76s)]
*  Some people can't? [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3580.0s)]
*  They really wanna play sports, people with asthma. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3580.84s)]
*  They really wanna play, [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3582.7200000000003s)]
*  and they look at people playing basketball, [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3584.36s)]
*  and they're like, I'd be really good at that. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3586.1600000000003s)]
*  The asthma saved you. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3587.88s)]
*  It might have saved you. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3589.2000000000003s)]
*  The asthma might have saved them. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3591.0400000000004s)]
*  But you gotta say, some people just can't do shit. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3592.2000000000003s)]
*  You can't do everything you wanna do. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3594.32s)]
*  But that's the opposite though, [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3595.32s)]
*  because the trans women are dominating, [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3596.1600000000003s)]
*  whereas the asthma people are sucking. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3597.5600000000004s)]
*  No, but they can't. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3598.96s)]
*  What I'm saying is there's a rule, [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3601.1200000000003s)]
*  and you're not allowed to. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3602.32s)]
*  That's fair, all right. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3603.4s)]
*  And there's a rule you're not allowed to play in the NBA [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3604.2400000000002s)]
*  if you got a heart condition. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3606.08s)]
*  Is that a rule? [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3607.88s)]
*  Yeah, remember? [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3608.72s)]
*  Didn't they have somebody that's not in the NBA? [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3609.56s)]
*  Somebody had like a heart condition. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3611.12s)]
*  I'm with you. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3613.6s)]
*  I think I just ate. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3614.44s)]
*  I think your father died. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3615.2799999999997s)]
*  And that's why you can play. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3616.84s)]
*  And then there was like a college kid or whatever. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3617.68s)]
*  They're like, pass out. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3619.04s)]
*  Ronnie James had a heart condition. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3619.88s)]
*  He played in the NBA. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3620.7s)]
*  They shouldn't allow that. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3621.54s)]
*  Well now, isn't he moving around? [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3622.68s)]
*  Is he still with the main roster? [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3624.12s)]
*  He's back in the G League. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3625.68s)]
*  He's dominating. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3626.52s)]
*  He's shitting on Ronnie like that. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3627.34s)]
*  That's why they moved him down, [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3628.18s)]
*  because he had a heart condition. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3629.02s)]
*  Why are you shitting on Ronnie like that? [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3629.84s)]
*  That's his point. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3630.68s)]
*  Ronnie was dominating the G League, [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3631.52s)]
*  but now he goes back and forth. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3632.4s)]
*  Listen, it sucks. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3635.04s)]
*  Everybody's snitching on James's. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3635.88s)]
*  Yo, you know what? [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3636.84s)]
*  When there's enough trans that they have their own league, [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3637.84s)]
*  they could do that. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3639.88s)]
*  That's the same thing as women. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3640.7000000000003s)]
*  Women probably wanted to play professional sports [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3641.54s)]
*  for a hundred years. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3643.32s)]
*  They were never allowed, [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3644.48s)]
*  because they weren't good enough. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3645.7200000000003s)]
*  Not even they weren't allowed. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3646.84s)]
*  It was like, you're just not good enough. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3647.84s)]
*  Then eventually they started their shit. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3649.2400000000002s)]
*  So when there's enough trans, and it's interesting, [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3650.84s)]
*  then you'll have your own league. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3653.12s)]
*  Until then, just play it as a hobby. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3654.36s)]
*  Right? [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3658.86s)]
*  That's what we told women for decades. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3660.02s)]
*  Play it as a hobby. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3662.66s)]
*  Yo, you like football? [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3663.7599999999998s)]
*  Play it as a hobby. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3664.7799999999997s)]
*  Then we made the lingerie league. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3665.7999999999997s)]
*  You could do that. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3669.18s)]
*  Or co-ed league, you do co-ed. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3671.66s)]
*  Co-ed, if that works. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3673.72s)]
*  Make a trans league. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3675.2999999999997s)]
*  You could do co-ed. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3676.14s)]
*  You would kill in co-ed. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3676.98s)]
*  I don't know, though. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3678.2999999999997s)]
*  It's not you would kill. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3679.14s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3681.46s)]
*  I think you put me on a team. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3682.2999999999997s)]
*  I wouldn't have much of a role. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3683.46s)]
*  I wouldn't really do anything. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3684.9399999999996s)]
*  And then you would cut me, [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3685.8599999999997s)]
*  because that's what you're supposed to do. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3686.7s)]
*  Somebody's just fucking wasting your resources. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3688.58s)]
*  How have they been cut enough? [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3690.62s)]
*  Okay. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3692.22s)]
*  I just, I don't know. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3693.06s)]
*  What would you do with them, Al? [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3695.2999999999997s)]
*  You'd let them compete? [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3696.94s)]
*  No. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3698.94s)]
*  How are you putting that on me? [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3699.7799999999997s)]
*  I'm just saying, you were posing the questions. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3701.46s)]
*  I just wanted to know your answer. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3703.18s)]
*  Because Yaa said that there's only two genders. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3704.14s)]
*  Can they swim or not? [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3706.14s)]
*  So if it's just two genders, then- [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3706.98s)]
*  Can they swim or not? [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3707.7999999999997s)]
*  It depends. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3709.54s)]
*  What if they cut the rudder? [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3710.38s)]
*  Are they black or what? [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3711.2s)]
*  If they cut the rudder, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3712.04s)]
*  are they allowed to compete with the women? [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3713.18s)]
*  It is funny. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3716.2599999999998s)]
*  It is funny to take a really- [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3717.5s)]
*  The rudder is the thing that comes down on a sailboat [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3718.34s)]
*  to keep it from sliding around on the top of the water. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3720.7s)]
*  It's a dick joke. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3724.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3725.74s)]
*  Yo, learn to sail, bro. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3729.62s)]
*  Come on. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3730.66s)]
*  Nah, we good. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3731.5s)]
*  It is funny to really care about the trans shit though, [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3732.34s)]
*  because it's like, [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3734.38s)]
*  when have we ever cared about women's sports? [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3735.22s)]
*  I don't give a fuck. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3736.82s)]
*  That's the thing. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3737.78s)]
*  It's not about, and I was saying this earlier. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3738.6s)]
*  This kind of dawned on me recently. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3740.88s)]
*  WNBA is just getting good. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3742.3s)]
*  I didn't go to a game, I was late. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3744.42s)]
*  But it's not about the trans thing specifically. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3746.3s)]
*  It's just the most egregious example of one party, [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3751.7000000000003s)]
*  or not even a whole party, [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3758.82s)]
*  but a group of people in that party, [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3759.6600000000003s)]
*  not being willing to acknowledge something absurd. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3761.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3764.3s)]
*  And it starts with things that aren't even that absurd, [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3765.1400000000003s)]
*  but you want them to acknowledge it. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3768.6400000000003s)]
*  Like the Elon thing. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3769.9s)]
*  Oh no, that's super absurd. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3771.0600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a really absurd thing. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3772.78s)]
*  I'm saying within, let's say there's certain things [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3774.74s)]
*  that Democrats were either defending or gaslighting by. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3776.8999999999996s)]
*  I'm trying to give an example of a more almost neutral one [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3779.7799999999997s)]
*  that you wanted them to go, [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3783.14s)]
*  ah, this is kind of weird. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3783.98s)]
*  But then it's not, really. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3785.3399999999997s)]
*  Like that we kept adding genders? [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3786.18s)]
*  We were talking about this yesterday. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3787.7799999999997s)]
*  Like the drag queen thing, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3788.62s)]
*  like reading books to kids? Even less than that. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3789.7799999999997s)]
*  I'm trying to think. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3791.2999999999997s)]
*  Like the EV quotas? [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3795.66s)]
*  Or like voter ID laws? [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3798.06s)]
*  Yeah, here's an example. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3799.8599999999997s)]
*  Like voter ID laws. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3801.46s)]
*  You go like, hey, should we have people provide an ID [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3802.46s)]
*  to go vote? [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3805.1s)]
*  And they're like, how could you do that? [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3805.94s)]
*  That's racist. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3806.78s)]
*  You're like, what do you mean it's racist? [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3807.62s)]
*  Like you need an ID to go on a plane. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3808.9s)]
*  Like why don't you need an ID to go to vote? [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3811.7400000000002s)]
*  I need an ID to go to the gym. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3814.1s)]
*  I can't go lift weights up and down without an ID. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3815.7400000000002s)]
*  You need an ID to get vaccinated. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3817.7400000000002s)]
*  You need an ID to get vaccinated, [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3818.86s)]
*  but you don't need an ID to vote for the person [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3820.66s)]
*  that's putting the fucking thing on my arm. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3823.18s)]
*  That is a little absurd. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3825.14s)]
*  But you say that, right? [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3827.14s)]
*  You go, hey, why can't you do it? [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3828.54s)]
*  And then they go, ah, it's racist. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3830.2200000000003s)]
*  These people don't really have IDs. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3831.74s)]
*  It's racist. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3833.06s)]
*  And the internal feeling is, I'm not racist. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3833.9s)]
*  Why are you calling me racist for asking [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3836.9s)]
*  like a pretty normal question, right? [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3838.18s)]
*  And then you go, I kind of get what they're saying. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3840.2999999999997s)]
*  That like, it's a disadvantage to certain people [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3843.06s)]
*  and they might not have the resources [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3845.14s)]
*  and the time to go do that. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3846.2999999999997s)]
*  It's still bullshit, but like they kind of have a point. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3847.2999999999997s)]
*  And then you keep on going up the ladder [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3851.06s)]
*  of more and more and more absurdity, right? [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3853.5s)]
*  You do like the drag queen brunch. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3855.7799999999997s)]
*  And you're like, why are they? [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3858.18s)]
*  No, reading to kids. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3859.22s)]
*  Drag queen brunch is a lie. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3860.14s)]
*  Drag queens. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3861.66s)]
*  Yeah, drag queens brunch is kind of a lie. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3862.5s)]
*  That's just sick as hell. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3864.18s)]
*  The drag queens read to the kids. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3865.58s)]
*  You're like, why are drag queens reading to the kids? [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3866.66s)]
*  And they go, well, why can't they? [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3868.34s)]
*  These are artists. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3870.1s)]
*  They're entertainers. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3870.94s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3872.86s)]
*  We bring entertainers all the time into school. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3873.7s)]
*  Like, what's the difference between that? [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3875.5s)]
*  You know, a drag queen and a ballerina, [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3877.26s)]
*  a drag queen and a gymnast. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3879.86s)]
*  Like, well, they're just an entertainer. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3881.14s)]
*  Why are you making this a sexual thing? [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3882.66s)]
*  And you go, yeah, but like, it's still weird. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3884.06s)]
*  But I kind of get what they're saying. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3890.02s)]
*  And you just keep escalating that. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3892.22s)]
*  And then the final boss, Bowser, [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3893.7s)]
*  is dudes that have chopped off their dicks or haven't. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3897.34s)]
*  Or not even. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3903.1s)]
*  And then are competing against women in a sport [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3903.94s)]
*  and absolutely dominating them. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3906.02s)]
*  And you're like, can you acknowledge that this is unfair? [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3907.86s)]
*  And they go, what are you, a fucking bigot? [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3911.06s)]
*  And then, so now it becomes about trans [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3913.42s)]
*  when it's not even trans. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3916.06s)]
*  The issue isn't even about trans. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3918.3s)]
*  It's about one party gaslighting, essentially, [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3919.94s)]
*  and not willing to acknowledge the absurdity. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3923.1800000000003s)]
*  And if all the Democrats start doing is going, [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3925.42s)]
*  I see why it might make some people uncomfortable [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3928.2200000000003s)]
*  to have a drag queen come and read to the kids, [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3930.3s)]
*  especially if they're familiar with drag culture, [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3933.2200000000003s)]
*  which is very raunchy. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3935.6200000000003s)]
*  If they hired Andrew Schultz to go read to the kids, [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3937.1000000000004s)]
*  I'm sure there's some parents who'd be like, [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3939.26s)]
*  yeah, I like that comedian, [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3941.5400000000004s)]
*  but he's kind of filthy and he says some edgy stuff. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3942.9s)]
*  Why is he reading to the kids? [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3945.6200000000003s)]
*  Does he have a child act that he does? [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3947.46s)]
*  If you hire, who's a clean comedian? [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3949.7000000000003s)]
*  Nate Bargatze. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3953.2200000000003s)]
*  Nate Bargatze or Jim Gaffigan to read to kids, [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3954.06s)]
*  nobody's, you let your six-year-old [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3956.1s)]
*  watch their comedy anyway. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3959.06s)]
*  So it's not a big deal, right? [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3960.78s)]
*  So I think that's what it comes down to. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3962.82s)]
*  And then, of course. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3965.46s)]
*  Oh, getting gender reassignment surgery [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3966.94s)]
*  without telling the parents. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3968.34s)]
*  The school being like, hey, we'll help you, [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3969.82s)]
*  you don't have to tell your parents. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3971.1s)]
*  You have a kid that's 12 years old and be like, [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3972.54s)]
*  I need to be a, what the fuck is going on? [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3974.02s)]
*  Who's raising my kids? [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3976.34s)]
*  And it's because the trans thing [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3977.8599999999997s)]
*  is the most egregious example of them gaslighting [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3980.18s)]
*  and not being willing to acknowledge the ridiculousness. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3984.2999999999997s)]
*  It's just the most egregious one. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3987.06s)]
*  We just talk about it nonstop, [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3988.74s)]
*  but in reality, they're a placeholder. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3990.4199999999996s)]
*  Nobody, most people don't really care about trans. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3992.58s)]
*  And they might disagree with the lifestyle. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3995.46s)]
*  That's a great take. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3997.06s)]
*  But they probably disagree with gay marriage [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=3997.8999999999996s)]
*  and these other things that they just ignore [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4000.2599999999998s)]
*  every single day. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4001.7s)]
*  And by not acknowledging certain unfairnesses, [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4002.54s)]
*  it makes it harder for trans people. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4004.2999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4006.1s)]
*  And that's why you make this like a huge hinge issue [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4007.78s)]
*  that now trans people have to be like, [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4009.86s)]
*  bro, I'm just trying to feel good in my body, [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4011.26s)]

*  And they're like, well, what do you think [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4014.54s)]
*  about the athletes? [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4015.38s)]
*  You're like, bro, I don't have anything to do with them. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4016.2200000000003s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4017.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4017.9s)]
*  And it's more of a cultural issue, [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4018.7400000000002s)]
*  political cultural issue between parties [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4022.38s)]
*  and just a social issue amongst Americans [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4025.34s)]
*  than it is actually about trans. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4027.86s)]
*  They're just the most absurd version of it. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4029.42s)]
*  And you have to go to the most absurd version [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4033.06s)]
*  to prove your point. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4034.7000000000003s)]
*  And I think that's the biggest thing [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4036.54s)]
*  that we're seeing in this country. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4037.58s)]
*  We're seeing this in the country [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4039.06s)]
*  that we're seeing trans people [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4040.42s)]
*  who are working sometimes. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4041.7s)]
*  That last one about the gender reassignment surgery [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4043.62s)]
*  for kids, it's like, that's even higher, right? [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4045.5s)]
*  We're going, okay, trans adults, [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4048.06s)]
*  you're like, okay, it's their body. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4049.98s)]
*  They can do whatever they want. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4051.46s)]
*  Like, yeah, they shouldn't compete against women, [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4052.7s)]
*  but you shouldn't, I'm not against you [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4054.3s)]
*  do what you want with your body. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4056.86s)]

*  It's, it's the cops. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4175.02s)]
*  Like you're not gonna pull a knife out. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4176.9400000000005s)]
*  Nada. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4178.26s)]
*  Two, a man and a woman just going at it. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4179.1s)]
*  To that terrorist. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4180.94s)]
*  Yeah, all for that. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4181.94s)]
*  Yeah, all for that. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4183.339999999999s)]
*  But yeah, it's like. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4184.179999999999s)]
*  I think those are the situations that drive us crazy [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4187.419999999999s)]
*  and really polarize people, if I'm being honest. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4189.94s)]
*  We talk about like the polarization all the time [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4192.54s)]
*  in politics, but like that's where it comes from. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4194.259999999999s)]
*  It's just not acknowledging the absurdity. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4197.0599999999995s)]
*  If you were around a school shooting, [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4199.58s)]
*  your kid was affected by a school shooting, [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4201.74s)]

*  we need more guns in schools. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4204.5s)]
*  You'd go, oh, they're evil. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4205.98s)]
*  They'll never change. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4208.86s)]
*  Their answer is more gun. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4211.1s)]
*  I'm gonna be the biggest progressive left wing forever. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4212.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4215.98s)]
*  And then vice versa. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4216.94s)]
*  All the people that consider themselves moderate, [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4218.0199999999995s)]
*  they call out the left for doing crazy shit. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4219.58s)]
*  I think in the event that that happens [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4221.42s)]
*  over the next four, eight, 12 years, [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4223.18s)]
*  also have the same responsibility [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4225.5s)]
*  to call out the crazy shit that happens [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4226.78s)]
*  when it shifts too far the other way. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4228.1s)]
*  Well, that's, yeah. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4229.42s)]
*  I mean, that's why, that's why. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4230.26s)]
*  I mean, I thought they were very kind to ask me [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4233.1s)]
*  if I wanted to go to the inauguration, right? [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4234.98s)]
*  And I'm sure that that invitation [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4237.7s)]
*  would have been extended to all of us. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4239.46s)]
*  And, but yeah, that's why I didn't wanna go. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4241.42s)]
*  I was like, I'm a comedian first. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4244.78s)]
*  Like, I don't want to be a fan of a political group. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4247.42s)]
*  And then seemingly the optics of it [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4253.86s)]
*  support everything that they do. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4257.14s)]
*  I understand it's like a fun event, [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4258.5s)]
*  and some people just went because it's a fun event. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4259.74s)]
*  I get that. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4261.38s)]
*  I've had friends even hit me up, they're like, [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4262.22s)]
*  listen, I don't care who, [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4263.22s)]
*  I just wanted to be there for this moment. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4264.74s)]
*  Not all the times that you get invited to inauguration. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4266.5s)]
*  I get that, sure, sure, sure. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4268.78s)]
*  But my feeling is like, [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4270.0599999999995s)]
*  the second people see me as one-sided, [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4271.82s)]
*  and there already are people that see me [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4274.58s)]
*  like I'm on one side. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4276.34s)]
*  If I go to the inauguration, [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4277.54s)]
*  I'm definitely framed as right-wing Trump guy. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4279.259999999999s)]
*  And then when I say something, like I've said today, [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4282.74s)]
*  about the Democrats and their philosophies [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4285.259999999999s)]
*  and their ideology that I think is like [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4287.099999999999s)]
*  causing a little bit of distrust, [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4289.7s)]
*  people are just gonna write it off as, [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4291.74s)]
*  oh, that's another Republican, [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4293.0199999999995s)]
*  just criticizing the Democrats. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4294.62s)]
*  And vice versa. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4296.62s)]
*  I'm gonna make fun of these motherfuckers [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4297.86s)]
*  for the next four years. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4299.219999999999s)]
*  So, I don't know, as a comedian, [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4301.42s)]
*  I feel like the perceived neutrality is really important. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4303.54s)]
*  Otherwise, every joke angle is predictable. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4307.179999999999s)]
*  It's the same criticism they say about SNL. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4309.98s)]
*  I think, the less maybe so now, [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4312.179999999999s)]
*  but you could just predict the angle every single time, [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4314.099999999999s)]
*  especially during COVID days. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4317.38s)]
*  I know it. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4319.7s)]
*  When Jimmy Kimmel goes out there, [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4320.54s)]
*  I know you're gonna cry about something. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4321.38s)]
*  I know it. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4323.74s)]
*  Something really affected you, and you're gonna cry. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4325.0199999999995s)]
*  I know it. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4327.22s)]
*  Nah, but that was just white dudes' Met Gala, [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4328.06s)]
*  so they don't want it to be there. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4329.780000000001s)]
*  They want it to be there. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4332.3s)]
*  They want to get their picture and everything. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4333.14s)]
*  I get it, I get it. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4335.18s)]
*  That makes sense. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4336.5s)]
*  It's just me, personally, just as far as comedy goes, [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4337.34s)]
*  I don't want you to frame me in any way, [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4340.1s)]
*  because I always want to be able to surprise you. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4341.58s)]
*  And I don't want Trump and them to have this expectation [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4344.66s)]
*  that I'm gonna dick ride for four years. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4347.900000000001s)]
*  Like, you didn't make fun of two. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4349.46s)]
*  Some policies are good, some policies are bad. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4351.26s)]
*  And you don't want to be beholden [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4353.02s)]
*  to have to sit on one side or the other. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4354.3s)]
*  But if you say some crazy shit, it's just satire, [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4355.9s)]
*  and you shouldn't go after the person saying, shh. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4358.3s)]
*  I agree, I agree. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4361.62s)]
*  Unless it's after you, which would be very funny. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4363.42s)]
*  I would enjoy that a lot. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4365.34s)]
*  I think that would be very humorous. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4366.74s)]
*  I'm sitting in your seat, so you're gonna be like, [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4367.98s)]
*  yeah, the guy in the middle of the table. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4369.86s)]
*  That's it, that's it. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4371.38s)]
*  I'm gonna say that a lot. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4373.0599999999995s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a break for a second. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4374.26s)]
*  I just need to tell you about starting a business here [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4375.78s)]

*  maybe you take payments, [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4382.66s)]
*  and then there is making that business legitimate. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4384.22s)]
*  How do you make it legitimate? [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4387.3s)]

*  Let's get back to the show. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4514.8s)]
*  All right, so day one, Trump saved TikTok. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4515.82s)]
*  He announced that he was issuing an executive order [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4517.9400000000005s)]
*  to extend the time before TikTok's law would take effect. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4519.74s)]
*  God bless. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4523.58s)]
*  This is an interesting one, the TikTok situation, [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4527.42s)]
*  because it seems like it should be so easily replaceable. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4530.74s)]
*  Like it seems like I should go onto Reels [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4536.26s)]
*  and it should just have a little button [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4538.38s)]
*  and it's like whatever kind of TikTok sounding word. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4539.86s)]
*  And then, what is it? [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4546.0199999999995s)]
*  Tick-cock. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4547.18s)]
*  Tick-cock, boom. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4548.0199999999995s)]
*  And it's just like, that's it, right there, we got it. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4549.3s)]
*  How the fuck is- [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4552.820000000001s)]
*  Just put some dances. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4553.660000000001s)]
*  Just do that, boom. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4554.5s)]
*  But how is TikTok's algorithm so much better? [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4555.700000000001s)]
*  China's AI, I think, is way ahead of ours. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4559.1s)]
*  Is that- [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4561.22s)]
*  That's what this leads me to believe. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4562.06s)]
*  We can't even replicate the fucking social media app. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4563.72s)]
*  That's what scares me about China more than anything. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4566.700000000001s)]
*  We cannot, our American AI, with as much innovation [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4569.06s)]
*  as we have, cannot touch this shit. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4572.1s)]
*  I thought we control AI. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4573.46s)]
*  Yeah, I thought we were way beyond. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4575.1s)]
*  Then why can we not get this algorithm? [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4576.820000000001s)]
*  I have no idea. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4578.54s)]
*  Even people who work at TikTok are like, [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4579.700000000001s)]
*  we don't have any fucking clue how this algorithm works. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4581.42s)]
*  It might not even be AI. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4583.58s)]
*  I wonder if it's just a Chinese dude [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4584.7s)]
*  that just shows you shit you like. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4586.02s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4587.900000000001s)]
*  I wonder if they have the manpower [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4588.74s)]
*  to have one guy for every person [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4589.74s)]
*  and they just show you, they're like, [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4591.22s)]
*  yo, Schultz loves this shit right here, bro. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4592.06s)]
*  Show him a guy doing a funny thing. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4594.26s)]
*  There is enough of them. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4595.74s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4596.58s)]
*  It's beyond AI. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4598.38s)]
*  Yeah, I just, I don't know. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4599.900000000001s)]
*  It's funny, because it's like, [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4601.74s)]
*  I was not upset that it was going away [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4603.74s)]
*  because it's the one that I still don't know how to use. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4606.18s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not used to it. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4608.86s)]
*  It had to be. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4609.7s)]
*  I was just being a hater. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4611.0199999999995s)]
*  And then I was like, [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4612.26s)]
*  but I think this was Trump's play for a while. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4613.54s)]
*  He already knew he was gonna bring it back [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4617.0199999999995s)]
*  because it's like, when it came back, [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4618.86s)]
*  the message was, oh, we worked with Trump to bring. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4620.62s)]
*  He just wanted a nice little slam dunk for the annulment. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4623.14s)]
*  Oh, 100%. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4625.14s)]
*  He gets the slam dunk. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4626.46s)]
*  It is peculiar though. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4627.38s)]
*  But liberals handed him that. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4628.22s)]
*  Yeah, but he wanted it at first. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4629.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's just like, I don't know. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4632.38s)]
*  What do you know about his last four years? [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4634.94s)]
*  Yeah, he wanted it at first. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4636.3s)]
*  It would seem that the more patriotic position [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4638.14s)]
*  is to remove the Chinese spyware from your citizens' phones. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4641.3s)]
*  That's the more patriotic position. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4646.58s)]
*  But somehow, his supporters, who, [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4648.78s)]
*  in a more traditional sense, you would argue, [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4653.58s)]
*  are more patriotic than the Dems, [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4655.62s)]
*  are saying, hey, this is awesome, you're keeping it. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4659.7s)]
*  I'm just so confused by this. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4662.54s)]
*  You go, freedom speech. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4664.3s)]
*  I actually talked to... [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4665.46s)]
*  But it's not free speech. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4666.9s)]
*  It's free, steal all of our data and give it to the opps. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4668.0199999999995s)]
*  The weirdest thing is when it was going away [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4670.82s)]
*  and then everybody was downloading the red something. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4672.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah, red notes. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4674.179999999999s)]
*  They were going even crazier. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4675.0199999999995s)]
*  Maybe that's why they brought it back. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4676.46s)]
*  Maybe they were like, listen, we need to keep TikTok [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4678.179999999999s)]
*  before they just give everything to China. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4679.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4681.46s)]
*  So I talked to the congressman, Rohith Khanna, [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4682.339999999999s)]
*  did a petition to save TikTok. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4684.38s)]
*  Yo, you bought, bro. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4687.54s)]
*  Actually, he's a Democrat. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4689.82s)]
*  No, I ain't saying my wish is up. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4691.38s)]
*  He's like a Bernie-type Democrat. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4692.86s)]
*  But he was saying, I just thought it was overreach [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4694.54s)]
*  where there were much more narrow solutions. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4697.42s)]
*  You could just pass a petition like, [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4700.22s)]
*  hey, you guys can keep TikTok here, [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4701.9s)]
*  but our data can't go to you. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4703.38s)]
*  Or for example. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4704.86s)]
*  That's what they say now. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4705.7s)]
*  But yeah, so he's like, there were much more solutions. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4706.62s)]
*  And then he goes, I can't help but notice the timing. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4709.18s)]
*  Once Israel-Palestine starts really popping up [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4712.62s)]
*  and TikTok seemingly has a lot more pro-Palestine people, [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4715.26s)]
*  all of a sudden, Congress is bringing back [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4718.06s)]
*  this Trump thing that was kind of dead before. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4720.22s)]
*  Hey, now TikTok is a problem. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4722.38s)]
*  We need to get it out of here. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4723.94s)]
*  And he goes, the timing to me was just, [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4725.0199999999995s)]
*  I thought it was suppressing freedom of speech. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4726.78s)]
*  It was too suspicious. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4728.94s)]
*  Now another way to look at that. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4729.94s)]
*  Which is a fire take. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4731.259999999999s)]
*  Is, you were saying that TikTok on the app, [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4732.219999999999s)]
*  there's way more pro-Palestinian perspective. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4736.5s)]
*  Yeah. Right? [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4738.74s)]
*  It seems, yeah. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4739.58s)]
*  I agree with you. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4740.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4741.299999999999s)]
*  Another way to look at that is, [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4742.139999999999s)]
*  if China wants to sow political unrest in America, [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4744.339999999999s)]
*  it bolsters the opinion that is not shared that much [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4749.099999999999s)]
*  on the mainstream media. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4753.26s)]
*  Or it's shared by the government at large. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4754.780000000001s)]
*  Like if the government is supporting Israel, [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4756.9400000000005s)]
*  and they go, oh, let's just do the thing [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4759.14s)]
*  the government isn't supporting. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4760.34s)]
*  Exactly, because we want to convince people [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4761.780000000001s)]
*  that the government is against their interests. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4763.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4766.58s)]
*  And now you just have infighting in America, [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4767.42s)]
*  especially at a time where there's a complete distress [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4769.66s)]
*  of the government, there's a distress of mainstream media, [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4771.46s)]
*  pharmaceutical companies, prison, everything, [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4773.780000000001s)]
*  there's distress. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4776.58s)]
*  So you can sow that. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4777.5s)]
*  And that's why it's dangerous to have an app [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4778.5s)]
*  that's that powerful. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4781.34s)]
*  Aren't there so many issues? [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4782.38s)]
*  Every social media app has divided us on every issue. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4784.58s)]
*  It doesn't matter every, George Floyd, whatever. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4787.42s)]
*  Every fucking issue, all social media does is divide us. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4790.9800000000005s)]
*  Facebook, X, whatever. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4794.42s)]
*  This election, we are divided. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4796.86s)]
*  All of a sudden on this one, [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4798.74s)]
*  now this is where America's gonna really [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4800.34s)]
*  tear itself apart. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4802.1s)]
*  But it's not just this one. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4803.3s)]
*  I think Twitch, you saw it as well. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4804.14s)]
*  Look, it could be what your guy is saying. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4805.34s)]
*  There is also a possibility it could be something else. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4809.42s)]
*  And the reason why they suggest it [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4812.259999999999s)]
*  is because that's probably exactly what we do [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4813.62s)]
*  in every other country. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4816.46s)]
*  Probably. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4817.58s)]
*  No, I don't. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4818.7s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4819.54s)]
*  Like if I'm America and the Ops got Facebook, [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4820.38s)]
*  you go get some pro-American shit in that Facebook. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4823.179999999999s)]
*  And it might not be American flags looking crazy. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4825.139999999999s)]
*  It just might be cool videos [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4827.179999999999s)]
*  where people in America are good looking, [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4829.299999999999s)]
*  they're driving awesome cars, [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4831.94s)]
*  and they're enjoying their free time. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4833.42s)]
*  Or there's a civil war in a country that we're beefing with [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4834.259999999999s)]
*  and you can stoke one side or the other. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4836.54s)]
*  It's a dangerous. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4838.5s)]
*  The difference with US companies [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4840.38s)]
*  is that we can bring them in front of Congress. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4842.34s)]
*  And we can bring them in front of Congress [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4843.82s)]
*  and be like, yo, what are you doing? [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4845.14s)]
*  Show us your files. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4845.98s)]
*  We're subpoenaing all your back end shit. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4846.82s)]
*  We can't do that to the ducks. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4848.3s)]
*  We did bring them in front of Congress. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4851.1s)]
*  We can't take ZZ Ping and bring him in front of Congress. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4852.74s)]
*  We can put his lemming there [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4855.46s)]
*  and he's just gonna be like, [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4856.78s)]
*  I don't know what you're talking about. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4857.62s)]
*  And they'll kill that motherfucker. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4858.58s)]
*  They'll kill the guy who owns it. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4859.5s)]
*  China don't give a fuck. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4860.5s)]
*  They brought the billionaire dude that owns it [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4862.26s)]
*  into a basement for two weeks. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4864.78s)]
*  But is it the- [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4866.34s)]
*  Remember, he just went ghost for two months. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4867.18s)]
*  One of the most powerful human beings on the planet. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4870.14s)]
*  But with your theory- [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4872.18s)]
*  Jack Ma. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4873.02s)]
*  That was still Alibaba, I think. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4873.860000000001s)]
*  With your theory, is it chicken or the egg? [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4874.900000000001s)]
*  Because it's like, a lot of young people [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4876.5s)]
*  were pro-Palestinian and we saw that live out. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4878.620000000001s)]
*  We saw that in colleges. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4881.740000000001s)]
*  We saw that on the streets and protests and all that shit. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4882.900000000001s)]
*  So is it China trying to push this message [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4885.02s)]
*  and it's convincing young people to be pro-Palestinian [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4888.58s)]
*  or they really were pro-Palestinian? [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4891.900000000001s)]
*  I think it's chicken. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4892.9400000000005s)]
*  So there you go. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4898.1s)]
*  I actually mean that seriously. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4899.9s)]
*  I mean that seriously as chicken, [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4901.74s)]
*  meaning I think young people were pro-Palestinian. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4903.099999999999s)]
*  A lot of these kids on college campuses were pro-Palestinian. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4907.419999999999s)]
*  I think you saw these views in, [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4909.46s)]
*  I think in intellectual discourse a lot. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4912.339999999999s)]
*  And I think that matriculated onto social media apps. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4915.339999999999s)]
*  And then if I'm China and I saw any unrest [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4919.259999999999s)]
*  in a country that I'm somewhat opposed to, [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4922.66s)]
*  push the gas. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4924.7s)]
*  Push the gas. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4925.54s)]
*  That's it. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4926.379999999999s)]
*  So it's not like they're making up something. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4927.219999999999s)]
*  But they're putting the gas on it. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4928.78s)]
*  And they might not at all, but they could. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4930.46s)]
*  And it's almost like would you want China [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4933.02s)]
*  to have the codes to any door in your castle? [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4936.66s)]
*  It's like, yeah, they only got the codes to one door. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4942.38s)]
*  It's like I don't want them to have it to any. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4945.62s)]
*  And the fact that we have no social media in China [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4948.14s)]
*  lets us know that they don't want us [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4950.7s)]
*  to have the codes to nothing at all. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4952.74s)]
*  And then add a layer to it for sure, [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4954.860000000001s)]
*  and then you see how the media is putting pressure [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4956.78s)]
*  on the government to be like, [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4960.82s)]
*  yo, give this chit chat shit out of here. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4961.74s)]
*  Because the enemy of my enemy is my friend. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4963.62s)]
*  Why do I gotta compete with this shit? [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4965.38s)]
*  I'm a little curious if Zuckerberg's super hard right pivot [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4967.62s)]
*  is trying to cozy up to Trump more and more [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4971.58s)]
*  and help him be like, you know, [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4974.94s)]
*  maybe we get this fucking shit done. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4975.98s)]
*  Bro, you build a business that big, [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4977.06s)]
*  you're a government employee now. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4978.42s)]
*  That's a utility. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4980.26s)]
*  Amazon is a utility. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4981.62s)]
*  Google's a utility. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4983.78s)]
*  Facebook or Meadow, whatever it is, is a utility. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4985.58s)]
*  You work for the government, right? [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4987.74s)]
*  The government's gonna call you. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4989.26s)]
*  That's the only person who can tell you what to do. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4990.38s)]
*  You're not like Equinox. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4992.06s)]
*  You don't own a business that you've franchised [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4994.38s)]
*  and you kinda do whatever you want with it. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4996.86s)]
*  It's like the way that your business works [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=4998.22s)]
*  affects elections, it affects ideology, [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5000.78s)]
*  and you will get calls from the president about that shit. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5004.1s)]
*  So you better cozy up. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5006.1s)]
*  So is this Trump giving in to the will of the people? [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5007.22s)]
*  Because you know Zuck and you know Elon [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5010.34s)]
*  would want TikTok gone. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5012.98s)]
*  I'll tell you one thing. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5014.26s)]
*  The only people who wants TikTok is the people. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5015.54s)]
*  Trump is a mirror to the will of the people. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5017.66s)]
*  And that is why he is so effective. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5020.820000000001s)]
*  His strategy from early on was recognizing [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5024.780000000001s)]
*  sentiments from the people [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5028.62s)]
*  that were just not politically recognized at all. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5030.18s)]
*  He is a mirror. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5032.780000000001s)]
*  So if they feel something, he feels it. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5033.860000000001s)]
*  And I think that's his natural way of being. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5036.3s)]
*  I don't think he's like this stubborn guy [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5038.58s)]
*  that only feels one way and then Roger, [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5040.74s)]
*  like he was a Democrat. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5042.62s)]
*  He's a Republican. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5044.3s)]
*  He's more of like a mirror to their will [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5045.62s)]
*  and their sentiment. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5048.82s)]
*  Now, he doesn't feel, I imagine, [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5049.66s)]
*  that the super progressive left-wing philosophy is real. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5053.7s)]
*  Like I don't think that he believes [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5059.7s)]
*  that people actually feel that way. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5061.38s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5063.94s)]
*  I think he's like, all right, some fringe group, [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5064.78s)]
*  but I don't know if that's like [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5066.58s)]
*  what the American people feel. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5067.78s)]
*  And I think, yeah, I think he's just really good at that. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5070.58s)]
*  Like Bernie is just authentically himself. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5074.7s)]
*  When it wasn't popular, he felt this way. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5077.14s)]
*  Now that it is popular, he feels this way. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5079.38s)]
*  The pendulum could swing away, he'll still feel that way. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5081.9s)]
*  And sometimes these like authentically driven human beings [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5084.26s)]
*  meet a cultural necessity. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5088.0599999999995s)]
*  And then you can become these superstars [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5089.82s)]
*  or whatever it is. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5093.7s)]
*  Apparently, TikTok CEO went to Trump's inauguration. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5094.82s)]
*  Yeah, he was there. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5097.74s)]
*  Oh shit. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5099.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, he pulled up. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5099.86s)]
*  You're kind of indicating like, yo, I'm down. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5101.9s)]
*  I'm down to work. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5103.419999999999s)]
*  And Trump is offering like a 50-50 deal. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5104.259999999999s)]
*  They also thank Trump in the thank you message [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5106.94s)]
*  on TikTok. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5109.54s)]
*  Yo, look, keep. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5110.379999999999s)]

*  It said something like, [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5112.9s)]
*  thanks to President Trump's efforts, [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5113.74s)]
*  we're gonna keep TikTok alive and try to find a solution. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5114.94s)]
*  Keep it alive. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5117.0599999999995s)]
*  Like I like American competition. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5117.9s)]
*  Like, yo, Zuck, beat this shit. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5119.419999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that is where it seems a little anti-American is. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5121.419999999999s)]
*  Hey, here's the best guy, let's stomp him out. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5123.5s)]
*  And that is the number one thing [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5126.0599999999995s)]
*  these Uber rich guys always talk about. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5127.94s)]
*  The thing that makes America great is free enterprise. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5130.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah, free marketing. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5133.259999999999s)]
*  You think you're, you want me to take me down, [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5134.099999999999s)]
*  build a better product. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5136.299999999999s)]
*  They build a better product and now you have a problem with it. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5137.58s)]
*  And I think Chinese Fire is a convenient thing to put on it. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5139.7s)]
*  Sure. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5141.82s)]
*  Now, I'm totally cool. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5142.66s)]
*  One, I have more confidence than China in our culture. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5145.099999999999s)]
*  Like I'm okay with them sharing, [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5148.419999999999s)]
*  like let's say there was more like Chinese shit on TikTok. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5150.46s)]
*  I'm like, run it, let's go, great. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5152.54s)]
*  We like it. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5153.82s)]
*  Like I think our culture is cooler, so we're gonna win. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5154.66s)]
*  If they're fair exchange. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5157.0199999999995s)]
*  But I'm totally cool if China makes tons of money off of it. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5159.58s)]
*  Create something cool for the world, profit off it. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5163.0199999999995s)]
*  That's great. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5165.179999999999s)]
*  It is a concern about the data transfer. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5166.459999999999s)]
*  So if we found out 100% for certain [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5170.459999999999s)]
*  that the data never left America [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5173.299999999999s)]
*  and it was completely closed in, [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5176.139999999999s)]
*  but they were still able to profit from the business, [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5178.5s)]
*  make all that money, dude. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5181.459999999999s)]
*  You made something great. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5182.5s)]
*  We buy Chinese products all the fucking time. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5183.419999999999s)]
*  We're wearing China right now. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5184.98s)]
*  So we're not against Chinese shit. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5186.5s)]
*  We're just against the idea [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5188.38s)]
*  that they could influence our culture [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5189.74s)]
*  in a way that was advantageous to them. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5191.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5192.94s)]
*  And I think you've said this before. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5193.78s)]
*  You give us one, we give you one, that's it. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5195.38s)]
*  Like just give us one social media app. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5197.26s)]
*  Take Black Planet. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5199.9s)]
*  Take Black Planet. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5201.34s)]
*  Yo, Black Planet used to be fire. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5202.9s)]
*  What was Black Planet like? [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5204.62s)]
*  It was Black Planet. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5206.14s)]
*  But like it was just like MySpace for black people? [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5207.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5210.14s)]
*  And then there was the Spanish one, Mi Gente. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5211.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5213.06s)]
*  Oh man, good old days. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5214.18s)]
*  And it was black only. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5215.94s)]
*  You couldn't get on there if you're white. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5216.86s)]
*  I got a fucking threesome off of Black Planet. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5218.0599999999995s)]
*  That shit was nice. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5220.42s)]
*  So they let white women on. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5221.259999999999s)]
*  Why the hell? [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5222.139999999999s)]
*  That's hot. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5222.98s)]
*  I was trying to say that. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5224.219999999999s)]
*  Get that? [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5225.54s)]
*  You got that out of my head. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5226.379999999999s)]
*  But to your point, [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5229.299999999999s)]
*  that's what this guy kinda was saying about like, [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5230.139999999999s)]
*  yeah, there's solutions. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5232.379999999999s)]
*  I'm not saying it's perfect, [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5233.5s)]
*  but it does seem like a very odd overreach solution [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5234.78s)]
*  to be like ban it, it's out of here. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5238.54s)]
*  Whereas you couldn't be like, [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5240.379999999999s)]
*  no, make them take one of ours. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5241.219999999999s)]
*  Fine, the data can't leave. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5242.46s)]
*  There's solutions. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5243.78s)]
*  Do you think Trump will find that solution? [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5244.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5247.22s)]
*  I mean like- [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5248.0599999999995s)]
*  The fact that dude is at the inauguration, [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5248.9s)]
*  he's definitely kissing the ring [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5250.62s)]
*  and he's gonna work with it. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5251.78s)]
*  Bro, he's gonna, this is, [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5252.62s)]
*  we spoke to him. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5254.099999999999s)]
*  The one takeaway I had from our conversation [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5255.0199999999995s)]
*  is he just likes making deals. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5257.0199999999995s)]
*  He loves negotiating. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5258.46s)]
*  He loves negotiating. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5259.3s)]
*  He don't like none of this other shit. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5260.78s)]
*  He likes negotiating and he likes entertaining. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5262.0199999999995s)]
*  He likes talking in front of people. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5263.62s)]
*  He has some fun with the attention. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5264.82s)]
*  But he likes winning the deals. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5266.34s)]
*  And like, I mean, if you even wanna, [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5267.7s)]
*  people respect him more than Biden. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5270.98s)]
*  Like the deal that Israel and Hamas got [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5272.7s)]
*  is the same deal that Biden administration offered them. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5276.58s)]
*  You know that, right? [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5279.179999999999s)]
*  It's the exact same deal. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5280.0199999999995s)]
*  There's one difference in that Trump called up Netanyahu. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5281.62s)]
*  Oh, that's impressive. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5285.82s)]
*  And he said, do what you're told, boy. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5286.66s)]
*  And he did it. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5289.66s)]
*  They said, do what you're told, boy. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5291.62s)]
*  And then he did it. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5292.94s)]
*  Simple as that. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5293.94s)]
*  He goes, you get no more weapons, [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5294.78s)]
*  you get no more nothing. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5295.78s)]
*  I told you I want the war over and it's over. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5296.62s)]
*  Simple as that. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5298.0199999999995s)]
*  I think it's a double win. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5298.86s)]
*  That was them working together, bro. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5300.74s)]
*  I would say, pardon Biden win, [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5302.900000000001s)]
*  but definitely Trump pushed it over the line. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5305.5s)]
*  Like it couldn't have happened without Trump, [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5307.74s)]
*  but Biden, they were working on that deal for a long time. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5309.38s)]
*  They just don't wanna give him no credit to Biden. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5312.900000000001s)]
*  What you're doing is adorable. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5316.7s)]
*  What you're doing is absolutely adorable. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5318.74s)]
*  This guy, he's going out bad, man. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5321.14s)]
*  Let me tell you something. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5323.06s)]
*  All they care about is legacy. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5323.900000000001s)]
*  Democrats deserve to go out bad. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5325.34s)]
*  Biden's legacy is his last debate. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5329.58s)]
*  Kamala's legacy is you got your ass beat. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5333.14s)]
*  You go out bad. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5335.34s)]
*  This is what Biden said his key regret [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5336.18s)]
*  for his presidency was. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5338.06s)]
*  Walking in the sand. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5339.1s)]
*  Nah, riding a bike. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5342.22s)]
*  Not taking more credit for his accomplishments. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5343.820000000001s)]
*  See, talk that shit Biden. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5346.66s)]
*  His key regret. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5348.38s)]
*  I don't know what you did, but talk that shit. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5349.22s)]
*  Not taking credit. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5351.26s)]
*  See, everybody wanna beat Trump, yo. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5352.18s)]
*  Everybody wanna beat Trump. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5354.66s)]
*  If Trump had never existed, [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5356.14s)]
*  a president would never say anything like that. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5357.780000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5359.18s)]
*  I'll give it to you. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5360.02s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5360.860000000001s)]
*  You're a public servant, bro. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5362.179999999999s)]
*  You need to serve. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5363.0199999999995s)]
*  Fucking showboat like that. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5363.86s)]
*  He never did Obamacare. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5365.54s)]
*  I mean. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5368.54s)]
*  Also, do you wanna see? [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5370.099999999999s)]
*  No, to be honest with you, Obamacare, [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5371.62s)]
*  I think that was one of the smartest things [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5373.94s)]
*  for Obama's legacy. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5375.46s)]
*  I know there are a lot of people who hate it. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5376.3s)]
*  Republicans use it as like a leverage tool [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5377.54s)]
*  to show how horrible he is. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5382.42s)]
*  And there are a lot of people who just say Obamacare's bad [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5383.74s)]
*  that aren't even signed up to Obamacare. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5385.46s)]
*  They have no fucking clue what it is. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5387.139999999999s)]
*  They also have seemingly no empathy [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5388.5s)]
*  to all the people with pre-existing conditions [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5390.94s)]
*  that were helped. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5392.82s)]
*  I was speaking to this dude. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5393.66s)]
*  So many people are on Obamacare right now. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5394.86s)]
*  It's the affordable care. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5396.86s)]
*  Did I say it on this pod, this story? [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5398.179999999999s)]
*  I forget. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5400.9s)]
*  It was brilliant. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5401.74s)]
*  But I met this dude who [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5402.58s)]
*  intimately involved in the Republican campaign. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5406.299999999999s)]
*  And we were hanging out. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5410.219999999999s)]
*  He's a nice guy. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5411.299999999999s)]
*  He goes, he's like, [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5412.139999999999s)]
*  I listen, I'm Republican. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5413.259999999999s)]
*  My dad was a coal miner in Ohio. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5414.259999999999s)]
*  And he goes, to this day, [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5416.94s)]
*  if anybody says anything bad about Barack Obama, [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5418.98s)]
*  he'll punch your teeth right out of your face. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5421.5s)]
*  I don't know why. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5423.0599999999995s)]
*  He goes, my dad had pre-existing conditions. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5423.9s)]
*  He's getting bounced around from insurance to insurance. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5425.58s)]
*  Hospital's not taking him. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5428.46s)]
*  Like he was gonna die. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5429.66s)]
*  My dad's alive. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5430.7s)]
*  He's Barack Obama. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5431.54s)]
*  So you can't say anything bad about Barack Obama. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5432.36s)]
*  And I think that's the thing that Republicans miss [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5434.219999999999s)]
*  about the Affordable Care Act or the Obama Act is [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5436.98s)]
*  those Bernie constituents, [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5440.179999999999s)]
*  those Republicans that kind of gravitated towards Bernie [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5443.86s)]
*  and his messaging. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5446.259999999999s)]
*  Remember when Bernie was really popping? [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5447.3s)]
*  And those working class Republicans [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5449.34s)]
*  that are put into like really fucking shitty positions [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5451.62s)]
*  where they have a lot of health issues [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5454.9400000000005s)]
*  because of the jobs that they're doing, [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5456.5s)]
*  their lives were saved by that Affordable Care Act [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5458.46s)]
*  and Obamacare. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5460.7s)]
*  So when you just yell out Obamacare is crushing America, [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5461.64s)]
*  and I say, is it crushing America [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5464.820000000001s)]
*  or is it saving hard work in Americans [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5466.3s)]
*  that you pretend to care about and love? [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5467.7s)]
*  Because you wanna care about them all the time [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5470.14s)]
*  but we gotta help these people. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5471.9800000000005s)]
*  And then when they're like, yo, [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5473.14s)]
*  my lung cancer needs to be treated. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5475.3s)]
*  Obamacare's doing that. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5478.06s)]
*  And they're like, oh, don't worry about that. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5479.22s)]
*  Exactly, you know it was favorable by both sides. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5481.06s)]
*  Trump tried to undo it like 20 times. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5483.22s)]
*  And nobody, nobody. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5485.34s)]
*  They couldn't undo the shit because he was like, [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5486.18s)]
*  yeah, no, it's too popular. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5487.98s)]
*  And I don't know if that's Barack's fault [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5489.02s)]
*  or it's the healthcare system's fault [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5491.34s)]
*  and the insurance companies gouging the American people. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5494.82s)]
*  I think it's very convenient. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5497.1s)]
*  And again, I don't know enough so somebody can be like, [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5498.24s)]
*  yo, Schultz, you have no fucking clue [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5499.78s)]
*  what you're talking about, you're right. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5500.82s)]
*  But my suspicion. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5501.94s)]
*  Yeah, it's a flinger. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5503.0599999999995s)]
*  But my suspicion is that it's a very easy political win [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5504.62s)]
*  to just blame it on Barack. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5508.2s)]
*  Yeah, because the insurance companies have fucked everything. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5509.58s)]
*  Healthcare's broken. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5511.66s)]
*  And it's called Obamacare. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5512.7s)]
*  That guy's a problem. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5514.82s)]
*  But you also could say, whoever's in power [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5516.179999999999s)]
*  for the last 100 years has let health insurance [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5518.8s)]
*  get to this point and the cost of medical care [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5521.219999999999s)]
*  get to this point where they can just fuck us [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5523.5s)]
*  at every turn and we just deal with it. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5525.34s)]
*  But what's so interesting is those same exact people [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5526.86s)]
*  are upset with the pharmaceutical companies. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5529.219999999999s)]
*  They're upset with the healthcare industry. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5533.46s)]
*  So it's like, Barack Obama's bad for trying to make sure [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5535.099999999999s)]
*  everybody got healthcare, but also the healthcare companies [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5539.38s)]
*  are bad. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5542.7s)]
*  Like Barack Obama made it expensive, [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5543.82s)]
*  but also the healthcare companies are gouging. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5545.5599999999995s)]
*  To me, I see some inconsistencies there. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5548.04s)]
*  It's opposing sides trying to shift blame. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5550.099999999999s)]
*  That's what all this is. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5552.5s)]
*  And it's the insurance fault. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5553.34s)]
*  And it's pharmaceutical companies' fault. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5554.8s)]
*  And I think both sides have let them just run amok. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5557.0599999999995s)]
*  I would like to talk to an insurance. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5559.74s)]
*  I would like to talk to an insurance expert [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5561.7s)]
*  and just have them sit here and break down [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5565.0599999999995s)]
*  how insurance companies gouge. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5566.98s)]
*  There's probably a position that they're arguing from too, [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5569.8s)]
*  which is, where we just shoot them. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5573.099999999999s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5578.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5580.42s)]
*  No, but like, I'm sure they have some argument. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5581.26s)]
*  I don't know what exactly it is. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5585.5s)]
*  Pharmaceutical companies and medical care, [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5587.42s)]
*  the cost of an MRI to the hospital is like, [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5588.86s)]
*  or an MRI machine is like astronomical. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5592.099999999999s)]
*  The cost of all these things is so inflated. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5594.3s)]
*  And so it just, yeah, everybody's just being greedy [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5596.74s)]
*  at the top. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5599.679999999999s)]
*  And then we're kind of having to suffer the consequences. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5600.5199999999995s)]
*  And then every time we're like, all right, [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5602.42s)]
*  we should just do national healthcare, [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5603.98s)]
*  you see some video pop up of like a line of 3000 people [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5606.179999999999s)]
*  in Canada trying to get their foot checked out. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5610.42s)]
*  And they're like, they told me my next appointment [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5612.82s)]
*  is eight months from now. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5615.0199999999995s)]
*  When I talk to Canadians, they don't love their healthcare. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5616.5s)]
*  I got a friend whose knee is fucked [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5619.14s)]
*  because it was like an unqualified doctor [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5620.26s)]
*  doing the surgery, blah, blah, blah, whatever red tape. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5622.18s)]
*  And his knee is just fucked. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5624.9s)]
*  Canada is tricky because a lot of those places, [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5625.86s)]
*  you can't get a private opinion. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5627.26s)]
*  They don't even have it as an option? [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5630.26s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of them, like a lot of, [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5631.86s)]
*  depending on your specific thing, [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5633.22s)]
*  like if you have a back issue, [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5634.38s)]
*  you might not be able to go to a private person [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5636.26s)]
*  and pay out of pocket. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5639.54s)]
*  They say you have to go through the system. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5640.94s)]
*  We wouldn't have that problem. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5642.06s)]
*  Canadians are too nice. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5642.9s)]
*  Americans, we wait that long. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5644.26s)]
*  We gonna start yelling. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5647.02s)]
*  We're not gonna be nice about it. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5647.860000000001s)]
*  I'm telling you. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5650.06s)]
*  I just wonder if you can do both, [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5650.900000000001s)]
*  like public school, private school. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5651.74s)]
*  In Europe, you have that. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5652.58s)]
*  So they have the public system [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5654.5s)]
*  and then if you have enough money, you can do privateism. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5655.9800000000005s)]
*  This is two out of every three Canadians [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5658.18s)]
*  have private health insurance right here. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5659.780000000001s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5661.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5662.22s)]
*  I think they do that in Canada. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5663.04s)]
*  Peter Atiyah told me that, bro. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5663.9800000000005s)]
*  This feeling's no fact, is that right? [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5665.58s)]
*  Let's get back to our roots. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5668.66s)]
*  Nah, but we need either like an AOC or a Bernie [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5670.58s)]
*  to just explain that shit. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5672.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5674.62s)]
*  I don't know, we need Luigi. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5676.099999999999s)]
*  We need Luigi, bro. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5676.94s)]
*  We need Luigi Mangione, dog. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5677.78s)]
*  I don't even want AOC or Bernie. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5679.0199999999995s)]
*  I want someone that's inside the medical apparatus. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5680.7s)]
*  I want them to speak. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5684.139999999999s)]
*  They're gonna be like tainted. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5685.42s)]
*  Good. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5687.76s)]
*  Get an ex. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5688.599999999999s)]
*  Get Andrew Bustamante for the health insurance companies. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5689.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5691.9s)]
*  He left. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5692.74s)]
*  Now we're ready to talk that shit with she. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5693.58s)]
*  Yeah, but like I wanna hear their argument. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5695.0599999999995s)]
*  They have to have an argument besides, [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5697.099999999999s)]
*  hey, we trying to make as much money as possible. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5698.66s)]
*  We don't care if y'all die. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5700.38s)]
*  That might be part of it, [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5701.68s)]
*  but there has to be some other argument. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5702.96s)]
*  Otherwise, everybody that works in healthcare [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5706.02s)]
*  is enabling it. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5708.78s)]
*  It's kinda fucked up. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5711.9400000000005s)]
*  You gotta work within the system. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5713.42s)]
*  Like. Yeah. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5715.5s)]
*  All right, I mean. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5716.86s)]
*  I know slippery soap, but I'm just saying it's like, hey. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5718.7s)]
*  I mean, that's the, my heart goes out to you. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5721.9400000000005s)]
*  All. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5724.18s)]
*  I know, I know. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5725.02s)]
*  That's the little my heart goes out to you. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5725.86s)]
*  So you're saying all health professionals [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5726.7s)]
*  should just be like, we're just not gonna treat anybody. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5728.38s)]
*  Not all health professionals, [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5731.78s)]
*  but the people that are working for the insurance agencies [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5732.62s)]
*  and continuing to like propagate this business structure. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5734.34s)]
*  Oh, I agree with it. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5738.02s)]
*  But again, I don't know enough to say, [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5739.66s)]
*  but maybe if it was. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5741.5s)]
*  People gotta die. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5742.34s)]
*  But maybe if it was presented like that, [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5743.54s)]
*  it'd be harder to accept a job in that way. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5746.22s)]
*  Maybe if that's how Americans felt about you, [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5748.82s)]
*  you'd be less willing to accept that position. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5751.7s)]
*  Like right now we kind of, [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5754.1s)]
*  I think there's been like a bunch of movies [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5758.26s)]
*  that came out that make working on Wall Street [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5759.74s)]
*  look really cool and like owning a hedge fund [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5761.78s)]
*  look really bad ass and cool and wild west like, [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5764.14s)]
*  and you're trying to, you know, stop, [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5768.46s)]
*  you're trying to circumnavigate the governments [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5770.5s)]
*  and they're trying to shut you down. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5773.14s)]
*  And they almost look like, what's it called? [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5774.660000000001s)]
*  Anti-heroes in a way. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5777.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5778.9800000000005s)]
*  But they all usually end pretty bad. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5780.18s)]
*  Yeah, but like, but maybe if, [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5781.9800000000005s)]
*  maybe if the movies we watched growing up [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5783.62s)]
*  position them as like greedy pigs [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5785.900000000001s)]
*  that don't really offer anything to society at all, [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5788.26s)]
*  and they're just making money by moving money around, [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5791.58s)]
*  maybe less people would be inclined to do those jobs. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5794.42s)]
*  Maybe because they'd be like, [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5797.0199999999995s)]
*  oh, there's kind of like shame put on this and being that. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5797.86s)]
*  Now I know there's a lot of money, [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5800.42s)]
*  but those people can make money doing other things. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5801.5s)]
*  Like there's way more money in tech [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5803.3s)]
*  than there is in working on Wall Street. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5804.5s)]
*  Like being a doctor, right? [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5807.06s)]
*  I imagine culturally, like, [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5809.66s)]
*  especially from everything Akash told me, [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5811.42s)]
*  there's this great cultural reward that comes from it. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5813.74s)]
*  Like there's honor in the community. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5816.34s)]
*  Beyond money. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5817.74s)]
*  It means more. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5819.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5820.54s)]
*  And you can own a hedge fund, [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5822.22s)]
*  you can make all these money, [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5823.06s)]
*  but I imagine within your community. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5823.88s)]
*  The admiration is toward the doctor. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5824.72s)]
*  So I wonder if we switched that reward system. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5826.34s)]
*  I get what you're saying, [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5829.9800000000005s)]
*  but being an engineer or a coder [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5830.82s)]
*  is a little bit harder than gambling on Wall Street. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5832.3s)]
*  It's way harder. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=5835.22s)]

*  Let's watch them when they got facial hair and shit [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6461.74s)]
*  and they're adults. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6464.46s)]
*  Also, I think though, if you don't have a pro team, [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6465.299999999999s)]
*  like those are the guys that that's all they have. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6467.98s)]

*  You watch high school. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6493.94s)]

*  a good team, then you'd get into it [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6497.94s)]
*  and you'd be indoctrinated. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6499.86s)]

*  I've been living through it for 30 years. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6527.3s)]
*  Deon is the one guy who can maybe push back [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6529.3s)]
*  on Jerry Jones and Stephen Jones and get his way. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6531.099999999999s)]
*  He's the only guy that can maybe do it. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6533.78s)]
*  He is such a fucking force of will. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6535.74s)]
*  Look at you, Dallas fan, look at you coming out. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6537.98s)]
*  Yeah, look at him coming out. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6539.58s)]
*  He's going home, he's going home, bro. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6540.42s)]
*  Deon comes back, I'm interested. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6541.26s)]
*  I'm watching again, Deon comes back. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6543.5s)]
*  You can't do that. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6544.7s)]
*  You left the team, you're gone. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6546.54s)]
*  You're no longer, you can't be a Cowboys fan. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6547.9s)]
*  I'm listening to you. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6550.18s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6551.02s)]
*  My wife knows more about teams than you. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6551.98s)]
*  She definitely does. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6553.58s)]
*  Oh, the Eagles are in it. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6555.42s)]
*  Yeah, the Eagles are in it, [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6556.38s)]
*  and I think they might win the whole fucking thing. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6557.22s)]
*  Really, they're that good. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6558.62s)]
*  And their quarterback is not good. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6559.46s)]
*  He's got his hurt knee, blah, blah, blah. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6560.9s)]
*  But I tell you what I always make the mistake of as a fan. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6562.34s)]
*  Defense really does win championships. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6564.7s)]
*  And I think the Eagles defense is really fucking good. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6567.1s)]
*  And Saquon Barkley is like having a historic season, [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6569.78s)]
*  and that might be enough. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6573.58s)]
*  And they don't play, [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6575.18s)]
*  dude, Lamar Jackson I feel so bad for. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6576.26s)]
*  Did you guys watch any of the games? [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6578.06s)]
*  I saw that, no. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6579.700000000001s)]
*  I just saw that guy Mark Andrews drop that. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6580.54s)]
*  Dropped the two-point inversion. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6583.34s)]
*  Lamar Jackson made two really bad plays [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6584.58s)]
*  throughout the game. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6586.660000000001s)]
*  But generally speaking, he had a pretty good game. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6587.700000000001s)]
*  That was a touchdown. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6589.660000000001s)]
*  That would have tied the game. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6590.5s)]
*  Now Josh Allen, this is where I feel like [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6592.34s)]
*  we kinda got robbed of really great endings. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6594.54s)]
*  Josh Allen, if he catches that, [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6596.820000000001s)]
*  gets the ball back with 90 seconds and two timeouts, [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6598.46s)]
*  and then you get to see him try to drive [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6601.3s)]
*  and see if they can have a game. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6602.900000000001s)]
*  That would have been sick. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6604.0599999999995s)]
*  The Eagles game, they were like, [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6605.459999999999s)]
*  the Lions, or sorry, the Rams could have come, [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6607.419999999999s)]
*  but they were down 15 to 28 with three minutes left. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6610.62s)]
*  It's like a fucking, they're done. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6613.58s)]
*  They score a touchdown, get the ball back, [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6615.259999999999s)]
*  get all the way to like the 20 yard line. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6616.78s)]
*  If that, if the Rams score a touchdown there, [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6618.5s)]
*  what a historic ending. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6620.66s)]
*  But for Lamar, I'm like, [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6621.82s)]
*  oh, you just gotta get out of the AFC. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6622.86s)]
*  Every great quarterback in the league is in the AFC. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6625.0199999999995s)]
*  Like, you know, when we were younger, [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6627.78s)]
*  it was like Aaron Rodgers, Drew Brees, [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6629.0199999999995s)]
*  Tom Brady, Peyton Manning. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6631.54s)]
*  Two of them were in one conference, [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6633.06s)]
*  two of them were in another. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6634.22s)]
*  Imagine they're all in. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6635.14s)]
*  One of those guys is just never gonna get anywhere. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6637.820000000001s)]
*  And that's where I feel like Lamar Jackson's stuck. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6641.1s)]
*  This is like when the East was trashing the NBA. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6642.9400000000005s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6644.900000000001s)]
*  But like, the Eagles have had a much easier path [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6647.580000000001s)]
*  if they get to the Super Bowl than the Bills would have had. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6650.38s)]
*  The Bills had to play the Ravens, [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6653.9400000000005s)]
*  then they have to get through their Chiefs [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6655.38s)]
*  if they beat them. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6656.38s)]
*  Like, I just think Lamar, poor guy, [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6657.54s)]
*  I really, he's not amazing in the playoffs, [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6660.1s)]
*  but he's good enough. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6662.46s)]
*  I think if he was on an NFC team, [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6663.3s)]
*  he'd get to the Super Bowl. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6664.74s)]
*  Did the Bills win? [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6666.18s)]
*  Bills won. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6667.26s)]
*  Stake-wise, I do think they can beat the Chiefs, [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6668.82s)]
*  but again, I could be underestimating defense. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6672.7s)]
*  Because the Chiefs have a really good defense, [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6674.94s)]
*  their offense is not that exciting this year. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6676.42s)]
*  So I think I'm just kind of taken in by Josh Allen [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6678.54s)]
*  and all the sexy things he's doing, [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6681.46s)]
*  but I feel like they could actually win it this year. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6682.9800000000005s)]
*  My prediction is Eagles and Bills. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6685.94s)]
*  I agree. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6689.26s)]
*  If you're gonna bet on that, by the way, go to Stake. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6690.1s)]

*  Come on, let's go, Ben. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6727.099999999999s)]
*  Ben, follow him on Instagram, he gasping right now. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6727.94s)]
*  Really? [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6729.58s)]
*  I didn't gasp, I ain't gonna lie. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6730.42s)]
*  Good luck to the American, though, always. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6732.94s)]
*  That's who I'm gonna. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6735.54s)]
*  How old is he? [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6736.38s)]
*  How old is Trump, baby? [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6737.22s)]
*  How old is he? [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6738.0599999999995s)]
*  Ben. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6738.9s)]
*  I think he's like 22, something like that. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6739.74s)]
*  He's a kid. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6741.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6741.86s)]
*  I saw him, I didn't even realize it was him. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6742.7s)]
*  I was in the Hamptons, and I think this was probably [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6744.26s)]
*  during like around the US Open last year. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6746.139999999999s)]
*  And I remember I saw this kid, I was like, fuck that kid. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6748.58s)]
*  I thought like, I don't know, I thought it was like [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6750.94s)]
*  maybe somebody's younger brother or something like that. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6753.219999999999s)]
*  That was Patrick Mahomes' brother, bro. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6755.0599999999995s)]
*  I thought it was Patrick Mahomes' brother for a second. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6756.54s)]
*  I mean, that's super insulting. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6758.0199999999995s)]
*  That's really insulting. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6760.46s)]
*  That's really insulting. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6762.299999999999s)]
*  Wait, why? [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6763.219999999999s)]
*  Because Patrick Mahomes' younger brother looks like [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6764.0599999999995s)]
*  he knows the Pythagorean theorem perfectly. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6766.339999999999s)]

*  Even if I'm describing it right now, [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6881.66s)]
*  you think it's pickleball, it's not pickleball. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6883.46s)]
*  Nah, paddle is fun. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6885.5s)]
*  It's a dope sport to watch and it's easier to play. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6888.3s)]
*  And here's the thing I would say, it's like, [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6892.780000000001s)]
*  and I think I've said this before, [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6895.14s)]
*  at every stage of the game, you think you're good. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6896.14s)]
*  Whereas with tennis or golf, in the beginning, [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6899.42s)]
*  you fucking suck and you know you suck. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6901.740000000001s)]
*  And it's like hard to even keep rallies going. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6904.02s)]
*  But paddle, because of the back wall and the sidewalls, [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6906.780000000001s)]
*  like you always have like a little bit of hope. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6909.5s)]
*  And the fact is doubles, [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6911.26s)]
*  if you're playing with someone that's played a couple of times, [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6912.5s)]
*  they can kind of save you, like they can keep you in it. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6914.14s)]
*  Nah, but you got better. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6916.06s)]

*  I did not. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6926.34s)]
*  Okay? [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6927.18s)]
*  Paddle is keeping his family together. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6930.86s)]
*  All right? [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6932.46s)]

*  That's crazy, because I'm not good. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6937.18s)]
*  The point of you playing paddle is so you don't get hurt [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6938.7s)]
*  and you still getting hurt in the easy sport for old people. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=6941.34s)]

*  before we get out of here, but I do want to say this [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7167.14s)]

*  The hardcore gay marriage is wrong. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7174.62s)]

*  You go to fucking hell if you're gay. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7178.3s)]
*  Those Republicans were there while Trump is dancing [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7180.42s)]
*  to YMCA with the village people. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7184.34s)]
*  So we gotta have a conversation about inclusivity. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7187.26s)]
*  So either they're tolerating it or they feel so ostracized. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7191.780000000001s)]

*  They're grandfathered in. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7253.34s)]
*  I mean, shout out to them. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7255.62s)]
*  Are they even gay or do gay people just be like, [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7256.9800000000005s)]
*  oh, this is fine? [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7259.14s)]
*  Like you said, one of them is gay. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7259.9800000000005s)]
*  Nah, they all gay. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7261.7s)]
*  No, the whole group is gay. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7262.54s)]
*  Yeah, the group is gay. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7263.38s)]
*  But one of them is more out than the others. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7264.78s)]
*  I mean, these guys are fire. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7268.82s)]
*  Shout out to Trump, man. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7269.900000000001s)]
*  That's inclusive. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7271.700000000001s)]
*  Remind me of us in a way, you know? [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7272.54s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7274.14s)]
*  I think I know which one I am. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7275.22s)]
*  All right, guys, listen, before we get out of here, [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7276.780000000001s)]
*  I wanna do a Patreon question. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7279.5s)]
*  One of my favorite things about Patreon [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7280.860000000001s)]
*  is just talking to you motherfuckers [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7282.22s)]
*  and the crazy questions you come out with. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7283.580000000001s)]
*  And what I really appreciate is how much you appreciate [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7285.06s)]
*  Miles and Mark right off the bat. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7287.34s)]
*  You always have love, kindness, and respect for them. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7289.54s)]
*  And I think that that should definitely continue. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7292.54s)]
*  I think that energy should be kept [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7294.860000000001s)]
*  in every single question and our reaction to it. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7296.620000000001s)]
*  So I think this question is from last week's Patreon. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7299.86s)]
*  And Miles, I know you're gonna choose a good one [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7303.62s)]
*  to give to the people, [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7305.86s)]
*  because these people need a good one. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7306.7s)]
*  It's Trump's America right now. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7307.54s)]
*  So one that would reflect that. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7309.0199999999995s)]
*  Gotcha. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7310.179999999999s)]
*  Okay? [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7311.0199999999995s)]
*  Miles, it's up to you. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7311.86s)]
*  Appreciate that. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7312.74s)]
*  Okay? [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7313.58s)]
*  If you could be an owner [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7314.42s)]
*  of any professional sports team in the world, [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7315.7s)]
*  what team would you pick [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7319.0599999999995s)]
*  and what would be the unique thing you did as an owner? [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7320.299999999999s)]
*  Ooh. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7323.46s)]
*  Any professional sports team. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7324.299999999999s)]
*  My answer is for me. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7325.139999999999s)]
*  Well, go. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7326.54s)]
*  I would own the Dallas Cowboys. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7327.379999999999s)]
*  And then the unique thing I would do [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7329.46s)]
*  is I would kill the owner of the former. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7330.3s)]
*  I'd have him put to death and hung in the gallows [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7332.099999999999s)]
*  with his son. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7334.22s)]
*  He really is King Joffrey, right? [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7337.74s)]
*  You get Joffrey vibes a little. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7339.0599999999995s)]
*  It's like I'm gonna castrate this man [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7340.66s)]
*  from the whole fucking arena on the star. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7342.14s)]
*  Luigi never made more sense to me in my life, dude. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7344.34s)]
*  That's what I'd do. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7349.099999999999s)]
*  And I'd be pretty unique and pretty popular, I think. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7349.94s)]
*  Would you help the team? [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7351.9s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7352.9s)]
*  How would you do that? [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7353.94s)]
*  I would be a little less hands-on. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7354.78s)]
*  I would hire some people that know what they're doing. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7356.46s)]
*  I'd outsource. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7359.22s)]
*  You guys handle it. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7360.06s)]
*  Let's go. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7360.9s)]
*  And then who would do the execution? [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7361.74s)]
*  Oh, I would execute myself. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7363.46s)]
*  You'd do that part hands-on. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7364.78s)]
*  That is me. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7365.9s)]
*  That's hands-on. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7367.14s)]
*  That's far. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7367.9800000000005s)]
*  That, I'm hands-on with. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7368.82s)]
*  Everything else. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7370.46s)]
*  Football matters, I don't understand. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7371.3s)]
*  Wanting to kill a guy who is really good. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7372.74s)]
*  That I got. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7375.14s)]
*  And knowing how to do it. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7375.9800000000005s)]
*  Yes, easy. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7376.82s)]
*  Very easy. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7377.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7378.5s)]
*  I like that. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7379.34s)]
*  Thousand percent. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7380.18s)]
*  Dallas Cowboys, 100%. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7381.02s)]
*  Thousand percent. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7381.86s)]
*  You wouldn't buy the Knicks? [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7382.68s)]
*  Oh, wow, that's interesting. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7384.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7385.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7386.26s)]
*  You could buy just the Knicks. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7387.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7388.860000000001s)]
*  Because I think he owns the Rangers as well, whatever. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7389.700000000001s)]
*  But yeah, I have no interest in the Rangers, [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7392.26s)]
*  but without a doubt, it would be the Knicks. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7394.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7396.54s)]
*  Like 100%. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7397.38s)]
*  And what would you do uniquely? [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7398.200000000001s)]
*  My answer is available. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7400.06s)]
*  I would hire, [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7401.660000000001s)]
*  I know exactly who I would hire. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7404.660000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7406.54s)]
*  I know exactly who I would hire to run the team. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7407.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7409.860000000001s)]
*  And then there it is. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7410.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I guess that's it. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7413.660000000001s)]
*  Simple as that. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7414.58s)]
*  I would buy the Knicks, [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7415.42s)]
*  and then I would hire Bobby Webster, [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7416.46s)]
*  the GM of the Raptors, [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7419.74s)]
*  to bring a New Yorker championship. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7421.5s)]
*  Wow. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7425.46s)]
*  100%. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7426.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7427.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7427.96s)]
*  Solid. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7428.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7429.62s)]
*  Yeah, this is where things get tricky though. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7430.46s)]
*  What's the unique thing you do [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7431.3s)]
*  that nobody else has done though? [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7432.14s)]
*  So I feel like if you can get Toronto [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7433.9s)]
*  to win a championship, [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7437.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7438.74s)]
*  you can get a major market to win one. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7439.58s)]
*  It's hard to get players to, [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7441.38s)]
*  they had to like trick [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7442.58s)]
*  Yeah, Kawhi. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7444.3s)]
*  to go there, [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7445.9800000000005s)]
*  and he only went for like a year. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7446.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7447.660000000001s)]
*  Remember, he was out immediately. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7448.5s)]
*  So like orchestrating that. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7449.34s)]
*  They were like, [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7450.46s)]
*  do you want to repeat? [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7451.3s)]
*  And he was like, [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7452.14s)]
*  No, I'm good. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7452.96s)]
*  I'll go to the Clippers. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7453.8s)]
*  Anywhere else. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7454.64s)]
*  How did they trick him? [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7455.46s)]
*  What do you mean? [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7456.3s)]
*  They didn't trick him, [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7457.14s)]
*  it was like a trade. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7457.96s)]
*  They traded for him. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7458.8s)]
*  But they traded it, [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7459.64s)]
*  they basically put together a team [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7460.46s)]
*  that needed that one more piece, [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7461.3s)]
*  and they took the gamble on getting one more piece [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7462.14s)]
*  knowing that he'd probably leave. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7464.700000000001s)]
*  So he begrudgingly wanted to change the championship. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7466.820000000001s)]
*  Yes, like 100%. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7468.34s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7470.42s)]
*  And the second he got out of there, [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7471.26s)]
*  he got nobody, [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7472.42s)]
*  I don't know if anybody in history, [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7473.26s)]
*  if there's been a star of a team [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7475.42s)]
*  that won a championship, [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7477.34s)]
*  had the opportunity to resign and then left. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7479.0599999999995s)]
*  Wow. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7481.34s)]
*  I've never heard of this, truly. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7482.179999999999s)]
*  He's not autistic, [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7483.0199999999995s)]
*  he's just apathetic. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7483.86s)]
*  Like everyone's like, [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7485.7s)]
*  man, he's got no emotion. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7486.54s)]
*  He's just genuinely like, [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7487.36s)]
*  give me the fuck out of here. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7488.28s)]
*  Get me out of here. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7489.12s)]
*  And so it's tough for like a non, [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7490.0599999999995s)]
*  it's weird to even call them not a major market [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7492.86s)]
*  because they are like Canada's team. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7494.94s)]
*  You have kind of like a whole country behind you. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7496.54s)]
*  But yeah, if you could make that happen, [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7498.66s)]
*  was it the same money? [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7502.08s)]
*  Like was money an issue for Kauai? [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7503.74s)]
*  I think it was more money to go to Toronto. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7504.58s)]
*  If we want to get into it. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7506.98s)]
*  There's been allegations that they, [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7509.179999999999s)]
*  the Clippers gave Kauai a little extra. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7511.179999999999s)]
*  That's what I'm doing. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7514.3s)]
*  So I'm buying the Knicks, [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7515.94s)]
*  I'm finding ways to give players extra bags [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7517.139999999999s)]
*  so we get the best talent. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7520.9s)]
*  I'm making the dancers way hotter. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7523.3s)]
*  Oh. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7525.58s)]
*  And back to the skimpy outfits. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7526.42s)]
*  Like now the outfits is too PG. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7528.0199999999995s)]
*  Fuck, I know there's kids there, [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7530.099999999999s)]
*  fuck all, they need to grow up. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7531.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7532.9s)]
*  Al got conservative as soon as he hypothetically got money. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7533.74s)]
*  Ain't that funny? [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7537.219999999999s)]
*  Ain't that crazy? [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7539.0199999999995s)]
*  He hypothetically got money. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7540.339999999999s)]
*  And he's like fuck all this women's empowerment. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7541.98s)]
*  Dress like hoes, get the ugly bitches out. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7544.0199999999995s)]
*  Yes, let's pay the players, you know, [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7547.139999999999s)]
*  that sneaky brown paper bag money. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7550.219999999999s)]
*  How can we not do that? [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7552.259999999999s)]
*  Like I'm wondering, that has to happen in New York. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7553.379999999999s)]
*  It's not pay the players directly, [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7556.139999999999s)]
*  but like you're in this major city. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7557.66s)]
*  So there are so many different companies [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7559.9s)]
*  that want to make you their mascot in some way. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7561.52s)]
*  Like how do we not get LeBron [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7564.080000000001s)]
*  when we had a chance of getting LeBron? [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7566.040000000001s)]
*  Cause LA. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7567.56s)]
*  Yeah, LA. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7568.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but we should've. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7569.240000000001s)]
*  No, but for Miami. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7570.080000000001s)]
*  Ah. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7571.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, like we should've. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7572.240000000001s)]
*  Also Miami. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7573.080000000001s)]
*  We should've thrown crazy bags. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7573.92s)]
*  Like. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7574.76s)]
*  Well apparently New York absolutely bungled [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7575.580000000001s)]
*  their like presentation or whatever. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7578.040000000001s)]
*  Like it didn't play, it was like some family guy shit [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7579.72s)]
*  they didn't care about or something. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7582.120000000001s)]
*  And then Pat Riley comes in with all of his rings [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7583.52s)]
*  as a GM, as a coach, as a fucking player, [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7586.56s)]
*  and just dumps them on the table. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7589.080000000001s)]
*  That's like his first move. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7590.88s)]
*  And if you're LeBron, you're looking at that, [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7592.4800000000005s)]
*  like that's the one thing. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7594.66s)]
*  I would've done that with a bag of money. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7596.08s)]
*  This doesn't stop. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7598.16s)]
*  Just tell me when to stop. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7599.9400000000005s)]
*  That's it. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7601.16s)]
*  That's it. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7602.0s)]
*  But also LeBron knows, he's gonna make the money. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7603.64s)]
*  Yeah, but I. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7606.32s)]
*  Anywhere, anywhere. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7607.16s)]
*  I just tell him whatever you want. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7608.16s)]
*  He is. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7610.04s)]
*  So it's like what you really gotta do [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7610.88s)]
*  is find out what they want. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7611.860000000001s)]
*  Like I think that's the tricky thing [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7612.84s)]
*  with these major players. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7614.28s)]
*  They're gonna get the maximum amount of what. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7615.12s)]
*  According to academics, hoes. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7615.96s)]
*  That's true. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7618.04s)]
*  Yo, can we talk about that? [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7619.240000000001s)]
*  Like where. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7620.84s)]
*  We should've talked about that on a regular episode. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7621.84s)]
*  Where do you stand? [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7623.4800000000005s)]
*  Where do you guys stand with academics [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7624.52s)]
*  alleging that LeBron was out there fucking bitches? [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7626.120000000001s)]
*  This is the smartest move by Drake. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7629.360000000001s)]
*  All right guys, thank you guys so much for listening. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W17FWAOC8oc&t=7631.400000000001s)]
