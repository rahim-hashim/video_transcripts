**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4)
*  Why is it rude to say to someone, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=0.0s)]
*  you guys are getting along, you're in love, you're having fun. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2.4s)]
*  Why do you want to get the government involved? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5.84s)]
*  What most people call love today [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8.16s)]
*  was something that was invented in the 50s to sell shampoo. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=10.96s)]
*  Wow. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=14.08s)]
*  All three of you have a prenote. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=14.8s)]
*  The government wrote it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=16.0s)]
*  You think that's a good idea? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=16.88s)]
*  You ever been to the DMV? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=18.32s)]
*  You ever walk into the DMV and go, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=19.68s)]
*  these people should be in charge of everything. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=21.52s)]
*  You are pro-marriage, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=23.28s)]
*  you're just anti-marriage without a prenote. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  People want to do dumb sh**. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=25.84s)]
*  You jump out of planes. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=27.04s)]
*  Like, I f**king care. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  You want to do some dumb sh**, do some dumb sh**. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=29.52s)]
*  Just admit you're doing some dumb sh**. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=31.6s)]
*  What is your craziest divorce that you've had? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=33.2s)]
*  I shouldn't say this in public, but I will. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=35.2s)]
*  Her husband ran her over three times and stabbed her 16 times. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=36.72s)]
*  Who's the worst in divorce? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=41.2s)]
*  Culturally, ethnically, racially. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=42.56s)]
*  Sometimes stereotypes are a real time saver. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=45.84s)]
*  Let's just call that out. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  Russian women, in my experience professionally, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=50.08s)]
*  they get f**king ice cold. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=52.96s)]
*  When you're married to a Russian woman, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=54.64s)]
*  there's nothing she won't do for you. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=56.32s)]
*  And when you're divorcing a Russian woman, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=58.08s)]
*  there is nothing she won't do to you. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=59.6s)]
*  Like, she will f**k your sh** right up. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=61.28s)]
*  Is there anything that you've learned through all these divorces [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=63.12s)]
*  about what makes marriages successful? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=65.84s)]
*  I've learned a lot by being a divorce lawyer [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=68.64s)]
*  about what keeps people together. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=70.64s)]
*  What I've learned, I would say more than anything else, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=72.08s)]
*  is just pay attention. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=73.92s)]
*  People get divorced the same way they go bankrupt. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=74.88s)]
*  Very slowly and then all at once. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=77.52s)]
*  What's up, everybody? Welcome to Flaygrid. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=80.48s)]
*  And today's guest, I just want to point out, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=82.08s)]
*  was not suggested by any of the people that were sitting here. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=85.28s)]
*  We were all happily married or in great relationships, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=89.76s)]
*  and none of us would suggest such a guest. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  A prolific guest, mind you. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=95.28s)]
*  We got Jim Sex in here. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=97.12s)]
*  The world's most murderous divorce attorney. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=104.80000000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=105.68s)]
*  That's going on the website. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=107.12s)]
*  I don't know what that is. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  The world's most murderous divorce attorney, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=109.84s)]
*  Andrew Schultz of Netflix fame. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=112.16000000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=114.88s)]
*  It's really, yeah. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=115.38s)]
*  Obviously, you're incredibly successful. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=116.08s)]
*  We've seen a bunch of the content that you've put up out on the internet, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=118.56s)]
*  mostly interviews that you've done. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=122.24s)]
*  It's kind of interesting because you've been this divorce attorney for decades, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=123.68s)]
*  and now you have a public profile about your job. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=126.32s)]
*  So bizarre. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=129.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=130.56s)]
*  So bizarre. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=131.04s)]
*  I can't actually stand still anywhere in New York City [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=131.52s)]
*  because people know you. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=134.24s)]
*  Without someone coming up going, you're that divorce lawyer. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=134.64s)]
*  The problem is when you do, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=137.84s)]
*  if you're going to be known for a viral clip, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=139.52s)]
*  don't be wearing the same outfit you wear every fucking day. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=141.68s)]
*  You're like Batman. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=145.28s)]
*  Because there's no way to camera. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  It's like your mustache. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=148.08s)]
*  If you shave that shit, you could probably get away with it for a few days. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, you could blend right in. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=153.76000000000002s)]
*  Maybe that's what I'm planning. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=155.44s)]
*  Without that, that's what you got to do. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=156.32s)]
*  You want to take a week or two off, you just get that right out. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=157.6s)]
*  That's free advice. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=160.88s)]
*  Are you new to Salino and Barnes for us New Yorkers? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=161.68s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=164.32s)]
*  I could be both Salino and Barnes. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=166.16s)]
*  Of course. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=168.16s)]
*  Man, that's a hype. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=168.88s)]
*  They had a bad breakup. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=169.68s)]
*  Did you work on that before? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=170.64s)]
*  I got the shit out of myself. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=171.67999999999998s)]
*  That's a deep cut New York reference. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=174.88s)]
*  I just want to let you know. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=176.23999999999998s)]
*  These were iconic New York lawyers. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=177.27999999999997s)]
*  And it was one of the first call lines for law advice. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=180.32s)]
*  Like 1-800-888-888. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=183.11999999999998s)]
*  Did that exist? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=185.6s)]
*  Salino and Barnes. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  Majority attorneys. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=187.67999999999998s)]
*  1-800-888-888. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=189.44s)]
*  There was a lot of eights. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=192.72s)]
*  And then they had the most brutal breakup, epic level breakup. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=193.67999999999998s)]
*  But then what's the... [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=199.28s)]
*  One of them died in a plane crash. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=200.56s)]
*  Which is like, here you go. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=201.84s)]
*  You finish this brutal hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=204.08s)]
*  trying to get away from each other and then one of you dies. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=207.2s)]
*  And it's all, fuck. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=209.28s)]
*  That's pretty lucky for you. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=210.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=211.68s)]
*  But not a guy. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=212.24s)]
*  He was like, shit, I could have saved some counsel. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=213.04s)]
*  How many people just kill their wife instead of divorcing them? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=214.88s)]
*  Surprising number of people killed. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=217.68s)]
*  Have you ever been involved in one of those cases? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=219.04s)]
*  I've never had one where someone was killed. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=221.12s)]
*  I did have a client who her husband or estranged husband, now ex-husband, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=222.88s)]
*  ran her over three times and stabbed her 16 times. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=228.88s)]
*  This is during the divorce? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=232.39999999999998s)]
*  During the divorce. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=233.92s)]
*  And she survived. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=235.28s)]
*  This guy couldn't even get that shit right. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  Like, stabs two and 16 times, run him over three times, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=238.64s)]
*  and she's alive to tell the tale and he's in fucking prison. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=243.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=246.56s)]
*  So she got 100% in the end, probably. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=247.04s)]
*  She got 100%. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=249.2s)]
*  She also had to get another kidney and some other things. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=250.0s)]
*  So she lost out. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=252.48s)]
*  Probably could afford that on a black market. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, with the amount of money. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=254.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, she did all right. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=256.0s)]
*  What role do you play in that? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=257.68s)]
*  I wasn't like the lookout, if that's what you mean. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=260.32s)]
*  Meaning, how much pressure were you putting on him? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=265.52s)]
*  A lot. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=269.12s)]
*  Yeah, I think when you're dealing with high net worth and ultra high net worth divorces. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=269.76s)]
*  What is high net worth? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=274.71999999999997s)]
*  So high net worth is generally defined as a divorce where the estate is more than $10 million. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=275.59999999999997s)]
*  Ultra high net worth is over $100 million. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=280.88s)]
*  So it's a different level in some ways because you're fighting over bigger numbers. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=283.36s)]
*  It's harder to track the values. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=288.4s)]
*  A lot of the stuff that people do for like wealth preservation and tax avoidance, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=290.24s)]
*  super, super rich people don't own anything. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=295.28s)]
*  They have trusts that own LLCs that are beneficiaries of, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=298.96s)]
*  and they're like great grandchildren that haven't been born yet, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=303.12s)]
*  own everything and they just borrow it from you. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=306.32s)]
*  So that's why they pay less in taxes than a guy who works at Burger King. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=309.2s)]
*  So it's unbelievable. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=314.24s)]
*  They're not actually generating income and you only pay tax on income. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=315.52s)]
*  Generally. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=318.8s)]
*  I guess you can pay capital gains too. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=318.96s)]
*  But not if you do it the right way. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=320.47999999999996s)]
*  So what happens is these people pay hundreds of thousands of dollars [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=322.64s)]
*  to accountants and tax attorneys to make sure they don't have to pay taxes. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=325.68s)]
*  But they don't anticipate that when they get divorced, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=329.28s)]
*  this is just going to blow up in your face. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=332.24s)]
*  Wait, why is it? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=334.15999999999997s)]
*  Because it makes it so complicated to figure out where is the money, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=335.12s)]
*  what is marital, what is outside the scope of the marital estate, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=339.12s)]
*  what can the judge get their hands on, what can't they get their hands on. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=342.32s)]
*  So it becomes a really, really tricky, messy thing. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=345.12s)]
*  Do you prefer the ultra high net worth clients, those cases? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=347.12s)]
*  I mean, they pay their bill on time, which is nice. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=352.16s)]
*  But outside of payment, is it just more stressful? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=354.24s)]
*  Is it more grueling? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=356.72s)]
*  Is it? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  You know, I'm very blessed. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=358.40000000000003s)]
*  I'm at the place in my career now where I have high net worth and ultra high net worth clients [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=359.52000000000004s)]
*  and you can have a smaller number of clients who you give a lot more personalized attention to. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=363.6s)]
*  Because anybody who's at a certain level of net worth, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=369.04s)]
*  they are used to being waited on and they're used to their professionals. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=372.16s)]
*  Like they've not romanticized a lawyer. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=375.52000000000004s)]
*  Like they know lots of lawyers. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=377.92s)]
*  So they look at lawyers like you'd look at a plumber. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=379.36s)]
*  There's a lot of people that do this. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=382.40000000000003s)]
*  You work for me and they're used to it. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=383.76000000000005s)]
*  So you have to give them a certain level of attention. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=386.8s)]
*  But unlike a plumber, you do get to yell at them. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=389.20000000000005s)]
*  Sometimes that's what they want. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=393.76s)]
*  This is interesting. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=395.12s)]
*  Yeah, you're almost like an authority figure. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=395.92s)]
*  Even though they're hiring you. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=398.08s)]
*  There's few positions where you're subservient to the person you're hiring. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=404.88s)]
*  Like a trainer is one of them. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=407.84s)]
*  Like your trainer can yell at you, tell you to be lazy, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=409.35999999999996s)]
*  you can tell them to stop eating this shit. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=411.59999999999997s)]
*  There's lawyer and then maybe like doctor. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=413.59999999999997s)]
*  People you should never lie to are your doctor and your lawyer. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=417.52s)]
*  Because everything you tell us, every single thing you tell us is protected by privilege. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=420.47999999999996s)]
*  And there's absolutely are only jobs to protect you. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=424.64s)]
*  How do you do that in the beginning? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=427.28s)]
*  So you're sitting down with somebody and you could tell they're being a little [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=428.32s)]
*  fugazi about the information. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=430.32s)]
*  How do you just go, dude, you're going to screw yourself if you don't tell me where [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=431.76s)]
*  the fucking bodies are buried? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=436.08s)]
*  I literally say that. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=437.35999999999996s)]
*  I don't pull any punches on it. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=439.84s)]
*  But what I usually will say to them just to kind of like take it to a place that they [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=442.23999999999995s)]
*  can understand is I'll say, look, I just want at the beginning of this relationship, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=446.0s)]
*  I want you to understand I represent people who've been victims of domestic violence. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=449.28s)]
*  I represent perpetrators of domestic violence. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=453.03999999999996s)]
*  I represent people who are by any objective standard, amazing parents. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=455.52s)]
*  And I represent people who just want to put the kids in the middle for leverage for child [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=459.91999999999996s)]
*  support purposes. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=463.12s)]
*  And I am no one's moral compass. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=464.32s)]
*  I'm a weapon and a weapon in the hands of a hero, right? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=466.4s)]
*  Is a great thing. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=471.35999999999996s)]
*  Is going to protect people. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=471.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=472.96s)]
*  And a weapon in the hands of the villain is going to cause chaos. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=473.35999999999996s)]
*  But the weapon is kind of neutral, right? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=476.08s)]
*  Who's the worst person you've defended? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=478.24s)]
*  Who? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=481.12s)]
*  I mean, obviously a lot of my clients, I can't disclose who they are. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=481.35999999999996s)]
*  Not in nationality. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=484.64000000000004s)]
*  But what did they do? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=485.84000000000003s)]
*  Oh, I've represented people who are, you know, by any objective metric are, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=486.96000000000004s)]
*  are, you know, malignant narcissists. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=491.52000000000004s)]
*  I mean, so unfortunately, the traits that make people very successful, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=493.68s)]
*  particularly in high finance, which is what New York is really like. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=498.40000000000003s)]
*  My colleague Laura Wasser is in LA. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=501.76000000000005s)]
*  She represents like every celebrity you've ever seen. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=503.84000000000003s)]
*  I represent a lot of people in finance who could buy those celebrities 10 times over, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=506.88s)]
*  but you would walk past you on the street. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=511.6s)]
*  You never know who they were. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=512.96s)]
*  Do you represent any current or former presidents? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=513.76s)]
*  No, no presidents yet. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=516.4s)]
*  Yeah, no presidents yet. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=517.6s)]
*  They all seem to keep it together. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=518.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=519.84s)]
*  Yeah, they're not. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=520.0s)]
*  Clint and I got my fingers crossed. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=520.64s)]
*  How do you come to those? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=521.76s)]
*  Bomber maybe. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=522.88s)]
*  Real quick, because I don't want to get away from that. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=524.24s)]
*  The reason why I was asking that question, like the worst person you've represented. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=525.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=528.16s)]
*  Like talking to you even before, you don't seem like a sociopath. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=528.48s)]
*  Like you seem like, even watching videos of you, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=533.04s)]
*  like you seem like quite like empathetic. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=534.96s)]
*  You have a lot of emotion, right? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=536.88s)]
*  I've seen you get like sensitive in interviews for sure. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=537.92s)]
*  So I understand, and there's a lot of times this happens with like defense attorneys. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=540.5600000000001s)]
*  You go, how could you represent this person? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=544.48s)]
*  It's a great question. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=546.8000000000001s)]
*  So you're representing sometimes scumbags. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=547.52s)]
*  Awful people. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=549.44s)]
*  Yeah, awful people. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=550.08s)]
*  Is there ever a moment where you're like, I can't fight for this guy? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=550.72s)]
*  No, because- [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=554.32s)]
*  Real quick, just a caveat. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=554.88s)]
*  This guy abuses his kids or this woman abuses her kids. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=556.64s)]
*  And by fighting for custody, I'm enabling the abuse of those kids. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=561.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=565.6800000000001s)]
*  So you have that thought. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=566.08s)]
*  So first of all, yes, I'm a sensitive person. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=568.4s)]
*  I don't think I could do this job well if I wasn't. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=572.0799999999999s)]
*  Because to do this job well, it's just like, I think it's like being a comic. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=574.0799999999999s)]
*  I think you have to have a sensitivity. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=577.36s)]
*  You have to be able to read what's going on with this audience [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=580.24s)]
*  and you have to know what's working, what's not be able to shift. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=582.64s)]
*  Right? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=584.9599999999999s)]
*  So it's the same exact thing. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=585.1999999999999s)]
*  It's just my audience is a judge. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=586.3199999999999s)]
*  And I'm really here, like our job's the same. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=588.88s)]
*  We're here to manipulate people's emotional states. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=591.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=593.76s)]
*  That's our job. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=594.3199999999999s)]
*  Like our job is to manipulate people. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=595.12s)]
*  You want them to laugh, relax, and enjoy. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=596.72s)]
*  I want the other side to be scared. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=600.16s)]
*  I want my client to feel safe. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=602.64s)]
*  I want the judge to like my client and hate the other side. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=604.24s)]
*  So I'm here just manipulating everybody's emotional state. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=607.44s)]
*  And to do that well, I have to be very open, receptive, empathetic, and sensitive. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=610.0s)]
*  The downside of that is, yeah, I'm sensitive. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=615.28s)]
*  You're feeling all that shit. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=617.76s)]
*  I feel a lot of it. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=618.72s)]
*  I represent the client, but I also represent the system. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=621.6s)]
*  And I don't always believe in the client, but I believe in the system. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=625.28s)]
*  Give me an example of that where those... [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=628.72s)]
*  I was talking about it on Mark's show some time ago when I represented a guy who was a pimp, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=630.4s)]
*  like literally a pimp. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=636.08s)]
*  That was his job. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=637.28s)]
*  Like he actually was, I mean, he had other, he's in federal prison now for guns, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=638.0s)]
*  but he was an atrocious human being. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=642.8s)]
*  He was an abuser. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=646.16s)]
*  He was, and I was up against an adversary who was an unskilled attorney and very, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=647.36s)]
*  like it was all this woman could afford. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=653.12s)]
*  I absolutely ran her over and we walked out of court and the guy pat me on the back and he said, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=656.0s)]
*  man, one good lawyer's worth 20 stick up men. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=662.32s)]
*  And I just remember thinking like, I want to go home and just take a shower right now, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=665.6s)]
*  because that just feels dirty. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=670.08s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=671.68s)]
*  But... [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=672.32s)]
*  So you do have that... [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=672.64s)]
*  I've always wondered if lawyers had that feeling. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=673.44s)]
*  Of course, of course. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=674.96s)]
*  And then can you compartmentalize that and move on? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=675.84s)]
*  I think you have to, because look, what I'll tell you is the truth has a way of coming out. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=679.12s)]
*  Sometimes despite my best efforts. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=683.84s)]
*  Meeting that guy ends up in federal prison. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=685.44s)]
*  Well, that's what ended up happening with that guy is he ended up in federal prison. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=688.0s)]
*  I mean, I think the truth has a way of coming out. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=690.4s)]
*  I have to tell my clients that sometimes. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=692.88s)]
*  Like, look, I can throw up a lot of smoke and mirrors, but shit comes out. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=694.4s)]
*  Like the truth comes out. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=697.52s)]
*  So many questions. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=699.9200000000001s)]
*  I'm sure everybody else does, but very exciting. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=700.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=702.24s)]
*  So there's this thing with lawyers where like a lot of times our engagement with lawyers [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=702.64s)]
*  is usually during maybe the worst times in our lives. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=707.52s)]
*  Sure. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=709.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=710.1600000000001s)]
*  So the connectivity that we have with lawyers is like, it's pretty abysmal. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=710.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=715.4399999999999s)]
*  But when you need help in a lawyer's helping you, they're heroic, as you just said. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=716.16s)]
*  And you've seen like TV shows that talk about like Lincoln Lawyer was a great movie with [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=720.72s)]
*  McConaughey. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=724.24s)]
*  Now they have this TV show where the lawyer is protecting the innocent that are wrongfully [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=724.72s)]
*  accused, et cetera. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=729.6s)]
*  Like you've seen it with Joe Pesci and my cousin Vinny and that kind of stuff. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=730.48s)]
*  Suits. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=734.88s)]
*  Are there suits? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=735.6s)]
*  Are there ever moments where you get to be the hero? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=736.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=739.92s)]
*  And what does that feel like? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=740.16s)]
*  That feels amazing. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=741.28s)]
*  That's intoxicating. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=742.0799999999999s)]
*  Give me an example of like somebody who you protected. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=743.1999999999999s)]
*  It was like a woman who was being abused. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=746.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'll give you a great one. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=747.4399999999999s)]
*  I'll give you a great one. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=748.0799999999999s)]
*  I'm a dog person. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=749.04s)]
*  I love dogs. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=750.88s)]
*  So I had a woman come in and she said to me, you know, described this situation of like [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=751.68s)]
*  coercive controlled domestic violence she'd been in for ages. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=757.8399999999999s)]
*  And this guy was controlling abusive in the worst, worst possible ways, like insidious [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=760.7199999999999s)]
*  ways, but also was an incredibly charming narcissist. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=766.64s)]
*  So like no one would ever suspect. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=769.76s)]
*  Like if you said to anybody this guy was an abuser, he's the nicest guy. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=771.6s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=775.52s)]
*  And she told me her story. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=777.12s)]
*  She said, I'm afraid nobody's going to believe me. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=779.92s)]
*  He said to me, no one will ever believe you. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=781.36s)]
*  You know, I'll make sure you're penniless. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=783.04s)]
*  I'll do whatever I have to do to like crush you. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=784.64s)]
*  And I'm listening to this and I've handled a lot of domestic violence cases before. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=787.4399999999999s)]
*  So I was like, okay, look, the system has a way of sorting these things out and let's [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=791.2s)]
*  talk about what we can prove and what we can't. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=794.4s)]
*  And she said, you know, I have something. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=796.56s)]
*  She said, we have a puppy. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=798.4s)]
*  We have a six month old black lab puppy. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=800.56s)]
*  And the ring camera of our doorbell caught him just beating the shit out of this six [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=803.84s)]
*  month old puppy. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=810.72s)]
*  And I was like, and you have that footage. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=812.56s)]
*  And she was like, yeah. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=814.8s)]
*  And I was like, okay, like give me everything you have and I'll take a look. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=815.52s)]
*  And I sat there that night and I watched this footage. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=819.04s)]
*  And as a dog lover, like I, I was shaking. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=822.0799999999999s)]
*  I mean, it was to listen to it, to hear it, like to watch. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=825.36s)]
*  This guy beating this puppy and the puppy like is a puppy. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=828.32s)]
*  It's tails wagging. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=831.9200000000001s)]
*  It's trying to like kind of get away from him and like, it doesn't understand what's [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=832.72s)]
*  going on. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=835.44s)]
*  And I just remember looking at it and thinking like, I'm going to torture this fucking guy [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=836.5600000000001s)]
*  to death. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=839.9200000000001s)]
*  I called her the next day and I said, I'll take your case. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=844.24s)]
*  And she was like, well, I'm worried. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=848.24s)]
*  I can't afford you. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=849.2s)]
*  I'm like, I'll cut my hourly rate in half. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=849.84s)]
*  I was like, I just want a piece of this fucking. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=852.4000000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=854.4000000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=854.56s)]
*  He killed it. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=862.64s)]
*  Dogs. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=865.68s)]
*  All right. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=866.0s)]
*  I got to eat. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=868.2399999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=870.8s)]
*  All right. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=871.1999999999999s)]
*  So how did you torture? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=871.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=872.3199999999999s)]
*  That's a shit. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=872.64s)]
*  Me a little bit worse than the memory of the dog. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=873.1199999999999s)]
*  For free. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=878.2399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=878.9599999999999s)]
*  Free. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=879.28s)]
*  God. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=879.8399999999999s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=880.4s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=881.1999999999999s)]
*  I cut my rate in half. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=881.5999999999999s)]
*  God. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=882.9599999999999s)]
*  That's impressive. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=884.24s)]
*  That's only like 500 bucks. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=884.9599999999999s)]
*  That's pretty good. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=887.1999999999999s)]
*  So I took on the case and, you know, I, I, it was like a professional hit. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=888.3199999999999s)]
*  Like I got this guy thrown out of his house. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=895.04s)]
*  I got, I mean, I, I, it happened to get assigned to a judge who I knew liked dogs, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=898.4799999999999s)]
*  who had a court attorney who I knew liked dogs. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=902.8s)]
*  So I just made a meal out of this. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=905.5999999999999s)]
*  Like you wouldn't believe. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=907.76s)]
*  And I actually, when I got to the courthouse, I shouldn't say this in public, but I will. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=908.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm close enough to retirement. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=911.84s)]
*  I can get away with it. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=913.0400000000001s)]
*  I actually went up to the court officers who are, you know, the, the security for the building, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=914.0s)]
*  they're armed, you know, and I said to them, by the way, this is because I had mentioned [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=918.08s)]
*  that there was this case coming in where I had video of this guy beating the dog. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=922.88s)]
*  And you ever want to see like people's vindictive side come out, tell them somebody beat up a puppy. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=925.76s)]
*  It's like, I have to tell you people, like a little old lady would be like, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=929.9200000000001s)]
*  kill the motherfucker. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=932.4s)]
*  You know, so I said to the court officer, I said, listen, I said, this case is in today. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=933.9200000000001s)]
*  They said, oh, that guy's today. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=939.2800000000001s)]
*  I said, yeah. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=940.5600000000001s)]
*  I said, and by the way, I said, if he and I ended up in the restroom at the same time together, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=941.52s)]
*  he started whatever fight happened. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=946.48s)]
*  And they were like, absolutely. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=948.72s)]
*  In fact, we heard him shouting at me. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=952.8s)]
*  I was like, thanks, man. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=954.96s)]
*  You know, and, but sure enough, like that was a case where that single piece of evidence [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=956.4s)]
*  was able to just neutralize his ability to go in and charm. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=963.28s)]
*  And you saw the real side of him. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=967.4399999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=969.68s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=970.56s)]
*  And the more he went in trying to be charming, as opposed to saying like, the more psycho he looks. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=971.12s)]
*  Sometimes you see a person and you can see in smaller examples, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=980.64s)]
*  but that's such a crystal clear example of like, oh, everything you say is bullshit. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=983.36s)]
*  This is you. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=987.36s)]
*  This is you. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=988.56s)]
*  And everything she says, I'm going to believe. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=989.36s)]
*  Well, and that's exactly what you say to the judge because I said to the judge, I'm like, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=991.28s)]
*  no judge, you know, for every cockroach you see, there's 50 in the walls. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=994.16s)]
*  Like we caught this on video. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=997.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=999.28s)]
*  Like, this isn't the only time. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=999.6s)]
*  How many other times, like when was the camera not rolling in the last? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1002.32s)]
*  And the next time I'm in court, it'll be another cockroach. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1006.16s)]
*  So just for my case, for my case specifically. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1008.4s)]
*  That's like when Diddy did the apology video, but then the hotel video came out and was like, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1010.72s)]
*  we looked at that apology video as such bullshit. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1015.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1017.84s)]
*  You're a psycho. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1018.0s)]
*  And this is in the lobby of the hotel. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1018.96s)]
*  That's in the entrance of the house. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1020.48s)]
*  We're not seeing what's actually happening behind closed doors. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1022.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1024.56s)]
*  So perpetrators of domestic violence are, in my experience, like they're, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1025.28s)]
*  they're charming. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1029.04s)]
*  Like how else would they get victims? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1029.92s)]
*  Like the way you, you know, there are people that are great at love bombing. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1031.52s)]
*  They're great at like convincing a person that, oh my God, I would never hurt you. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1034.72s)]
*  I care so much about you. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1038.4s)]
*  And then when something happens, doing the whole like, I'm so sorry that that happens. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1039.2s)]
*  You know, I love you so much. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1044.16s)]
*  It'll never happen again. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1045.3600000000001s)]
*  It's really interesting because a lot of times when they're portrayed in like TV or film, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1046.24s)]
*  they're these like drunken asshole scumbags. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1050.08s)]
*  No way. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1052.48s)]
*  But there was that show, I don't know if it was Pretty Little Liars or something, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1052.88s)]
*  not Pretty Little Liars. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1056.16s)]
*  The one that takes place in Silicon Valley at Nicole Kidman. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1057.68s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1061.1200000000001s)]
*  Uh, I know what you're talking about. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1061.68s)]
*  Big Little Lies. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1062.96s)]

*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1064.3200000000002s)]
*  The, the, the, the husband of Nicole Kidman was an abuser. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1064.96s)]
*  That was a great portrayal of what they're like. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1069.28s)]
*  What they actually are like. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1071.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1072.8000000000002s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1077.44s)]
*  Like all these things. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1077.76s)]
*  Because a lot of that like adjustment personality disorder, that like sociopath behavior, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1078.4s)]
*  that ability to sort of blend into your circumstances. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1083.28s)]
*  A, it makes people very effective in their professional lives because they can just go [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1086.3999999999999s)]
*  into whatever setting and be whoever they need to be in that setting. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1090.56s)]
*  I mean, yeah. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1093.44s)]
*  But in their home life, it turns into something that, you know, that's, that's chaos when you [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1094.08s)]
*  have to deal with those DV cases. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1098.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1099.68s)]

*  So funny, so charming. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1105.76s)]

*  listen, I'm a straight piece of shit. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1240.0s)]
*  I've been this woman for years. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1242.72s)]
*  I just need you to help me get out of it. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1244.88s)]
*  It's not our work. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1246.8s)]
*  They come in like a victim, too. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1247.44s)]
*  They come in and they're like, listen, she's crazy. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1248.16s)]
*  She attacks me. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1251.44s)]
*  And once I had pushed her off me. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1252.32s)]
*  She hit against the wall, but now she's going to falsely accuse me of domestic violence. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1254.16s)]
*  And you sit there and you're kind of and sometimes I'm in court. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1257.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1261.3600000000001s)]
*  When I'm sitting my clients next to me and I realize like, oh shit, I've got the villain. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1262.3200000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1267.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1268.64s)]
*  That was not great. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1269.28s)]
*  It's not surprising when people tell you the story of their life. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1271.04s)]
*  They're usually the fucking hero of the story. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1274.72s)]
*  Rarely do they come in and go, listen, I'm all fucked up. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1277.76s)]
*  It's one of the few things that like standups I think do very well. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1281.8400000000001s)]
*  Most people come in and just go like, oh, listen, I'm wonderful. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1288.56s)]
*  I'm great. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1292.24s)]
*  And then you sort of learn progressively and you start to look at their text messages. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1292.64s)]
*  And also do there's like human growth too, like who you were 10 years ago and who you are now. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1296.88s)]
*  I had a client once who was a custody case about like a 10 year old. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1302.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1306.24s)]
*  And when the woman was pregnant, when the mother was pregnant, so 11 years earlier, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1306.96s)]
*  he had sent her all these text messages saying, because they'd been dating for like two months, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1313.8400000000001s)]
*  like you need to get an abortion. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1317.92s)]
*  I don't want this baby. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1319.52s)]
*  If you have this baby, I want nothing to do with it. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1320.72s)]
*  And of course he'd been for 10 years a phenomenal father loves his. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1324.0s)]
*  And the other side in our exchange of discovery, you have to like share all your ammunition in [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1328.16s)]
*  advance because it's not supposed to be trial by surprise. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1332.96s)]
*  They sent me these text messages. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1336.24s)]
*  Real quick, so everybody understands that is that like all the information that both lawyers are [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1338.08s)]
*  going to use in court has to be shared with both lawyers. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1343.12s)]
*  So no lawyer is going, ah, but you didn't see this. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1345.52s)]
*  Exactly right. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1347.6s)]
*  So anything you're going to put in like photographs, audio recordings, video, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1348.16s)]
*  you have to exchange it in advance. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1351.92s)]
*  That's called discovery. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1353.36s)]
*  It's called discovery. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1354.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1355.28s)]
*  And it's a process where it's meant so that everyone has the opportunity to like review [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1355.44s)]
*  something, make sure it's authentic, have it reviewed by experts if they need to, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1359.92s)]
*  and also to prepare their case. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1363.44s)]
*  Prepare their case as best they can. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1365.12s)]
*  You're not allowed to like trial by surprise. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1366.4799999999998s)]
*  Did you order the code red? [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1368.1599999999999s)]
*  It doesn't really work that way. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1369.6s)]
*  Like what you have to do is you have to exchange the stuff. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1370.9599999999998s)]
*  So they'd sent these text messages and my attitude was, okay, we got to get in front of this. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1373.6799999999998s)]
*  Like we got to like M&M eight mile final rap battle. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1378.8s)]
*  Like I got to go in and like cover this and be like, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1382.2399999999998s)]
*  now tell these people something they don't know about him. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1385.04s)]
*  You know, like I got to do something with it. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1386.7199999999998s)]
*  So that's exactly what I did. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1388.6399999999999s)]
*  I put them on the stand and I said, you know, you see these text messages, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1389.84s)]
*  you know, did you send these texts? [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1393.52s)]
*  He said, yeah. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1395.1200000000001s)]
*  And I said, is that how you felt at the time? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1395.68s)]
*  He's like, yeah. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1398.4s)]
*  And I was like, how do you feel when you read those text messages now? [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1399.04s)]
*  And this guy legitimately started crying on the witness stand. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1401.68s)]
*  And he was like, I'm so, he's like, I'm so mad at myself. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1404.4s)]
*  He's like, and I'm so horrified and I'm so like, if she'd listened to me, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1408.8s)]
*  I wouldn't have my son like, and he's like, I, I, but I, but I know I was like [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1413.3600000000001s)]
*  just stupid and scared. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1417.68s)]
*  And I'm watching opposing counsel just crossing out whole pages [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1419.6799999999998s)]
*  because we got in front of it, you know, but that is like what happens. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1425.04s)]
*  And that's also like a more human relatable moment. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1428.6399999999999s)]
*  Like it is terrifying. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1430.7199999999998s)]
*  I imagine when somebody gets somebody pregnant and they're not aware of it, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1432.2399999999998s)]
*  they don't know what to do. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1434.7199999999998s)]
*  And that's this knee jerk reaction and you sound horrible. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1435.6s)]
*  And then you have 10 years with the most amazing thing you've ever created. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1438.1599999999999s)]
*  And you were just so embarrassed that that you're like, you could have made [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1440.8799999999999s)]
*  one flippant decision that eliminated those 10 years. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1444.2399999999998s)]
*  Well, and that's what that's why, you know, when people say like representing [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1447.28s)]
*  good people and bad people, like if only we could just put people in boxes of [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1450.08s)]
*  good people and bad people and just separate them. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1453.44s)]
*  But like, you know, the line of good and evil runs right through the human heart. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1455.44s)]
*  So I think at the end of the day, what you have to say, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1458.56s)]
*  like if I judge your husband being a husband, your ability to be a husband by [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1462.08s)]
*  your best moment as a husband, you're a phenomenal husband. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1467.28s)]
*  If I look at the worst moment you've ever had as a husband, that's the totality of you. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1470.72s)]
*  I'm bonafide. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1474.8s)]
*  That's not how it works. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1475.2s)]
*  You kind of have to average it out. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1476.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1479.52s)]
*  So that's an interesting thing too, because I imagine in divorce or in an argument or [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1480.64s)]
*  in anything, the only thing that we're focusing on are the worst moments of that person's life. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1485.52s)]
*  So I'm sure the husband and the wife in those circumstances are just judging them by the most [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1491.3600000000001s)]
*  horrible things that they've done. When in reality, there's probably amazing memories. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1496.8s)]
*  I'm not talking about domestic violence people. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1500.0800000000002s)]
*  I'm talking about people that had a marriage and then it became loveless. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1501.52s)]
*  They're like, let's separate. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1504.0s)]
*  And now it gets contentious over kids or assets. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1505.2s)]
*  But again, you're just focusing on these horrible things. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1507.52s)]
*  Not a beautiful vacation you guys went to. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1509.36s)]
*  Not a great time you guys cooked dinner together. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1511.36s)]
*  The laughs. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1513.04s)]
*  And again, maybe this doesn't make you enough money, but is there ever, not enough money, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1515.04s)]
*  but is there ever a moment in divorce where both lawyers are going, hey, should we try? [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1519.04s)]
*  These people don't hate each other. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1525.04s)]
*  Nobody did something heinous. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1526.64s)]
*  How can we not prolong this? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1528.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1530.48s)]
*  Do you guys do that at all? [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1531.12s)]
*  100%. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1532.32s)]
*  The best of us absolutely do that. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1533.12s)]
*  You live and die by reputation in this business. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1536.1599999999999s)]
*  And if you're the kind of person that just exacerbates conflict, you don't last long in this business. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1538.32s)]
*  Because why? It looks like you're just trying to milk it and then the lawyers get rich and everybody else. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1542.56s)]
*  Yeah. And your client leaves with a really bad taste in their mouth because they start, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1546.24s)]
*  they see that you're just amplifying. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1550.8s)]
*  My job very often is to protect people from the part of themselves that's feeling broken, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1552.8799999999999s)]
*  hearted, and vindictive. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1556.72s)]
*  Oh, so they- [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1557.84s)]
*  People come in and they're like, I caught him fucking his secretary. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1558.72s)]
*  I want to rip his nuts off. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1562.0800000000002s)]
*  I hate, I want to kill him. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1563.44s)]
*  And my job is to go, look, you have every right to feel the way that you feel. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1564.5600000000002s)]
*  But let's focus on the issues right now. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1569.0400000000002s)]
*  You're going to have grandkids with this person someday. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1571.92s)]
*  You're stuck with him. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1574.48s)]
*  You're going to see him for the rest of your life, no matter what. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1575.5200000000002s)]
*  I have an ex-wife. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1578.16s)]
*  Trust me, I got to sit next to her at graduations. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1579.0400000000002s)]
*  I got to sit next to her. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1580.96s)]
*  It's what you do. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1581.8400000000001s)]
*  So you have to learn how to interact with this person. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1583.0400000000002s)]
*  And you try to say to them, look, most people, the good news is, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1585.8400000000001s)]
*  most people love their kids more than they hate their ex. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1588.32s)]
*  Most people's love for their children is the most powerful thing they have. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1591.9199999999998s)]
*  I know we've got two relatively new fathers here. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1595.52s)]
*  I mean, the truth is that that is a powerful emotion [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1599.6799999999998s)]
*  that very often will make you put down a lot of other stuff. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1603.2s)]
*  And so it really turns into something where our job is to try to bring out [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1607.04s)]
*  the angels of people's better nature. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1611.36s)]
*  So I always tell clients, in a negotiating table in a courtroom, I'm a weapon. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1613.04s)]
*  My job is to just go at a person and attack and do that. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1617.76s)]
*  Before you get there. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1620.72s)]
*  When the door is closed, it's me and my whole thing is, look, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1621.6s)]
*  I'd rather you pay her than pay me. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1625.04s)]
*  Like, stand down. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1627.12s)]
*  Like, let's not do this. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1628.32s)]
*  Put your kids through college, not mine. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1629.6s)]
*  Like, let's figure out how to do this right way. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1631.28s)]
*  If I get a sense when I do a consult with somebody [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1634.0s)]
*  that they have any chance that they could go to a mediator [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1637.12s)]
*  instead of using lawyers and they could sit, I'll send them right to a media. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1640.08s)]
*  I probably send two, three cases a week to mediators. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1643.76s)]
*  Is that the, what is like the process? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1646.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1649.52s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of paths up the mountain, but the ideal process [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1649.9199999999998s)]
*  is two people sit down and they map out what do you want to do with the kids? [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1653.9199999999998s)]
*  What's going to make sense? [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1658.3999999999999s)]
*  Like, well, you work this night, I work this night. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1659.4399999999998s)]
*  So you'll have the kids this night or that night. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1661.36s)]
*  Ideally, people could sit down at the kitchen table [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1663.52s)]
*  with a piece of paper and just map it out. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1665.4399999999998s)]
*  But second best is you go to a mediator. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1667.52s)]
*  That's a person who's usually an attorney or an accountant, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1670.56s)]
*  who's trained, who knows what issues to talk about. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1673.1999999999998s)]
*  And they walk through it with you and they'll say, all right, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1675.84s)]
*  here's the things we have to decide. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1678.32s)]
*  And they don't represent either person. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1680.0s)]
*  They represent both people in a sense. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1681.76s)]
*  The next step from that is you get two attorneys that work collaboratively. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1684.32s)]
*  They just don't come at each other. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1688.3999999999999s)]
*  Don't try to vilify either side and just try to work, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1690.24s)]
*  come up with identifying assets, valuing them and how to divide them, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1693.1999999999998s)]
*  figuring out what's going on and just doing it that way. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1696.72s)]
*  The thing I've got very good at over the course of 25 years [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1699.6s)]
*  is the warfare part of it. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1703.6799999999998s)]
*  Like the courtroom. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1705.76s)]
*  So the people that come to me now tend to be people that have that complex case. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1706.56s)]
*  And they need someone who knows how to do that particular set of skills, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1711.28s)]
*  which is why I have all of these amusing anecdotes of like chaos. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1714.7199999999998s)]
*  But the truth is, like the majority of divorce lawyers, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1718.3999999999999s)]
*  it's really just about a negotiation. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1721.28s)]
*  It's about trying to sort of work with people in a way that doesn't amp up the conflict. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1723.28s)]
*  Yeah. 56% of people get divorced. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1727.4399999999998s)]
*  It can't be 56% warfare. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1729.4399999999998s)]
*  No, it's actually, thankfully, a really small percent. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1731.28s)]
*  But the outliers, like very few people can just like hold hands, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1734.24s)]
*  sing kumbaya and like write it down and solve it. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1739.1200000000001s)]
*  Very few people go to war. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1741.44s)]
*  But you hear about the war because, A, it's way more fucking interesting. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1743.2s)]
*  I don't get invited to a lot of parties, but if I'm at a cocktail party and someone says, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1748.3200000000002s)]
*  what do you do? [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1750.96s)]
*  I say, I'm a divorce lawyer. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1751.3600000000001s)]
*  And they're going to go, oh my God, you must have stories. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1752.24s)]
*  And if I said, I do, there was this couple and they were married [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1754.8s)]
*  and then they slowly grew apart from each other. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1757.92s)]
*  They decided how they would like amicably resolve their differences financially [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1760.3999999999999s)]
*  and they shared their time with the children. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1764.24s)]
*  They'd be like, that's the worst fucking story. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1765.6799999999998s)]
*  Like they want to hear the like, no, and then he took a chainsaw and he cut the car in half. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1767.76s)]
*  And they said, pick which half you want, bitch. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1772.32s)]
*  You know, like that story, by the way. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1774.3999999999999s)]
*  No, yeah. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1776.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. What is your, let's go there. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1777.52s)]
*  What is your craziest divorce? [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1779.6799999999998s)]
*  Well, I mean, the guy and the lady over and stabbed her 16 times. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1781.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Fun crazy. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1784.0s)]
*  Yeah. Fun crazy. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1784.8799999999999s)]
*  No, it doesn't have to be fun. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1785.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1786.8s)]
*  Just insanity. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1787.9199999999998s)]
*  You're involved in this case. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1789.44s)]
*  You're like, what the fuck is happening? [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1790.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I've had ones where like there's a lot of cash involved. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1792.0s)]
*  So I had one where they, they over the years guy was a dentist and he took a lot of cash. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1796.1599999999999s)]
*  And what he used to do is he used to wad it up in like these round things [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1802.96s)]
*  and then fill tennis ball cans with cash. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1806.6399999999999s)]
*  And then they had a jacuzzi in the backyard and he lined the jacuzzi thing with these tennis ball cans. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1810.0s)]
*  So there was like $800,000 of cash in the lining of the jacuzzi. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1816.8000000000002s)]
*  And I actually had to bring in an expert to testify to the size of the jacuzzi [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1822.0800000000002s)]
*  and the size of how much could be held in the tennis cans to ascertain what the value [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1830.4s)]
*  of the money that he had then removed from the jacuzzi was. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1835.0400000000002s)]
*  He took it all out. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1837.68s)]
*  Took it all out. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1838.48s)]
*  And he was like, what money? I don't know what you're talking about. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1839.1200000000001s)]
*  So that kind of stuff is like always an interesting bizarre puzzle. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1842.0s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, people are constantly cutting shit in half. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1845.4399999999998s)]
*  I mean, the ones that shock me are the people who come in and they've... [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1847.84s)]
*  And by the way, like Apple, like Apple technology is responsible for more divorces than they have. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1854.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1861.76s)]
*  That's real discovery right there. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1863.28s)]
*  Yeah, I saw shots fired. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1864.6399999999999s)]
*  It's jobs. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1866.4799999999998s)]
*  I saw Tim Cook's gonna like, my iPhone's gonna stop working now. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1867.1999999999998s)]
*  Love your products. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1870.08s)]
*  Don't do that to me, man. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1870.8s)]
*  But the truth is, like there's the whole integration of the different devices. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1872.0s)]
*  A lot of people don't realize like your fucking text messages are coming up on the iPad that [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1877.44s)]
*  your kids play with. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1881.6s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1882.48s)]
*  And then your wife, like you're upstairs texting with the girlfriend about like, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1883.12s)]
*  it was so great last night, you know? [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1888.08s)]
*  And then the kid is like, bing, bing, bing. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1889.76s)]
*  And mom comes over like, what's going on? [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1892.48s)]
*  And they're like, I don't know. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1893.92s)]
*  The cartoon stopped. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1894.8s)]
*  And mom's like, what is this? [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1896.32s)]
*  And all of a sudden there's naked pictures of the girlfriend. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1897.36s)]
*  And she's reading in real time. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1899.44s)]
*  And this happens like once a week. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1902.72s)]
*  I get one of those things. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1905.04s)]
*  Okay, question about that. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1906.72s)]
*  Do you think those people are just at the point where they're okay getting caught? [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1907.76s)]
*  Because that seems so foolish. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1911.52s)]
*  Yeah, I ask myself that question a lot because sometimes people are so brazen. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1913.6000000000001s)]
*  That it's just like you kind of go, yeah, like I want to be a part. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1918.0800000000002s)]
*  On some level, subconsciously, you're like, they're just cowards. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1920.3200000000002s)]
*  They can't admit it. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1924.0800000000002s)]
*  And they're like, I just need some. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1925.04s)]
*  If something does happen where it doesn't, I'm okay with it. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1927.1999999999998s)]
*  But I don't want quiet quitting. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1929.76s)]
*  Yeah, I feel, you know, Patrice O'Neill had a thing he used to say about. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1931.6799999999998s)]
*  Point me over right there. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1936.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1937.12s)]
*  He had a great thing about how he said, you know, cheating, if you think about it, is a man. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1938.08s)]
*  A man is leaving his home to get some happiness without hurting your feelings. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1944.6399999999999s)]
*  Go to fuck a girl behind a dumpster. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1951.52s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1952.9599999999998s)]
*  Like, but fooling around. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1953.4399999999998s)]
*  Get a little bit of happiness. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1954.2399999999998s)]
*  So I think a lot of these guys. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1955.04s)]
*  Without hurting your feelings. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1956.88s)]
*  Cheating is for you. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1957.44s)]
*  Yes, for you. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1958.48s)]
*  Yeah, and I remember like hearing that and going like, but you know, [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1959.52s)]
*  when you spend enough time with people who've cheated. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1962.16s)]
*  That's legit, they're like, look, I love her. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1965.44s)]
*  I love her. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1968.16s)]
*  But we don't have that anymore. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1968.88s)]
*  Like we have this, like we're running a daycare center together. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1971.76s)]
*  And like, I love her. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1975.1200000000001s)]
*  I like coming home to her. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1976.24s)]
*  I like her mom. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1977.44s)]
*  I like her brother. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1978.4s)]
*  Like we all get along. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1979.3600000000001s)]
*  I like all the stuff we do. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1980.88s)]
*  I like our home. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1982.48s)]
*  I like our life. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1983.2s)]
*  But like, I want to fuck sometimes. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1983.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1986.0s)]
*  Like I had a friend who once said to me like, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1987.3600000000001s)]
*  the moment you know you're in a relationship [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1990.16s)]
*  is when you're in the middle of sex and you think, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1993.04s)]
*  one of these days I've got to get laid. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1996.0s)]
*  And I think that most married men do not acknowledge that this is correct. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=1999.52s)]
*  No, it's a bit. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2004.0800000000002s)]
*  Most married men will go, oh yeah, okay. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2004.5600000000002s)]
*  Like, I kind of get that. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2009.8400000000001s)]
*  Like the difference. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2011.1200000000001s)]
*  Because again, I think there is something really true about you can't, [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2011.76s)]
*  some of the freaky shit you want to do in your head. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2015.68s)]
*  You blame Pornhub. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2018.8s)]
*  You know, it's on all everybody's heads. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2019.6s)]
*  You're not going to do that with the person that then you'd be like, [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2021.6s)]
*  okay, so which of us is going to bathe the kids now? [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2023.44s)]
*  Like that's not going to do that. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2025.2s)]
*  So I think men sometimes move away from that kind of a connection with their spouse. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2026.8799999999999s)]
*  And then they say, look, I don't want to hurt her. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2032.4s)]
*  I don't want to lose my family. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2034.8s)]
*  I want to chase this shiny object. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2036.48s)]
*  And by the way, like, I mean, how, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2038.16s)]
*  look at how many half naked women we are exposed to on a daily basis. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2041.04s)]
*  Thanks to Instagram and Tik Tok and everything else. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2046.6399999999999s)]
*  Our fault, really. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2049.44s)]
*  We have to keep degrading the women we love. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2050.4s)]
*  I don't think that's bad advice. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2053.36s)]
*  I mean, so in so far as they at some point enjoyed that. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2055.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2058.4s)]
*  Like if they were, if you started out that way and then you said, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2058.88s)]
*  she might secretly be like, why don't you have a, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2061.84s)]
*  I mean, you guys are like a filthy slut. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2063.68s)]
*  I'm also a mom, but I'm also a filthy slut. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2067.2s)]
*  We can be both. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2070.4s)]
*  You can be both. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2071.1200000000003s)]
*  I think you probably. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2072.08s)]
*  Mark, that's why our parents are still married. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2072.8s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2074.8s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2075.92s)]
*  I didn't know what the gyms, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2076.7200000000003s)]
*  custom in the basement. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2078.8s)]
*  There's no Madonna war complex. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2081.1200000000003s)]
*  You gotta just put them together. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2082.6400000000003s)]
*  Put them together. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2083.6800000000003s)]
*  Your parents got eight kids. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2084.1600000000003s)]
*  I could have told you they were doing some while. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2085.2000000000003s)]
*  My dad always makes this comment, we'll be at dinner. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2087.1200000000003s)]
*  He's like, you know, man, do you still got that nurse outfit? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2088.7200000000003s)]
*  Everyone's like, dad, what the fuck? [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2091.6000000000004s)]
*  No way. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2092.48s)]
*  He's like, I'm joking. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2094.2400000000002s)]
*  But dude. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2095.28s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2096.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's, yeah, that's interesting. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2097.52s)]
*  Cheating is one of those things. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2099.52s)]
*  I mean, I joke that I've got a PhD in cheating because you, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2100.64s)]
*  you listen to people who've been cheated on. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2104.4s)]
*  You listen to people who've done the cheating. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2106.16s)]
*  But the people that I'm shocked by are the people that like, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2107.7599999999998s)]
*  they know their spouse is cheating. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2111.68s)]
*  Like they had one of those iMessage moments where they like, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2113.2799999999997s)]
*  cameras catch stuff, all the little Nest cams, security cams, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2116.56s)]
*  the baby cams, nanny cams, catch stuff. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2119.92s)]
*  And they don't let the spouse know that they know it. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2122.96s)]
*  And they're like three, four months in to like, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2126.96s)]
*  I watched this person having sex with their mistress on the nanny cam. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2130.72s)]
*  And I'm still sitting across the table from them. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2135.7599999999998s)]
*  And I find myself thinking like, how the fuck do you keep that? [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2138.3999999999996s)]
*  You're the sociopath, actually. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2142.56s)]

*  You know, but people can do it. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2151.52s)]
*  Why do you think that? [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2152.3999999999996s)]
*  Kids usually are. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2153.3599999999997s)]
*  I think it's, I don't know, I think it's a combination of like, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2154.72s)]
*  if they say it out loud, it's real. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2158.16s)]
*  They're in denial. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2160.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2161.3599999999997s)]

*  they have a very hard time. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2163.8399999999997s)]
*  There's tissues on like every desk because people just, [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2165.12s)]

*  Like, I think sometimes when you're like young and in a relationship [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2176.64s)]
*  and you don't have like children or anything like that, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2180.0s)]

*  So yeah, I'm interested to talk about that. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2193.6s)]
*  Not for personal reasons at all. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2195.8399999999997s)]
*  No, no, no, nothing to do with that. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2198.3999999999996s)]

*  you have homes, you have a life that you guys all enjoy. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2203.6s)]

*  But when the husband does some shit, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2213.04s)]
*  I wonder if some of the wives are like, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2214.56s)]
*  does he not have a relationship with her? [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2217.7599999999998s)]

*  Well, and the question. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2223.2s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2224.24s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2224.88s)]
*  It depends on the nature of the infidelity. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2225.2s)]
*  Yeah. If you get your dick sucked while you're in a trip with the boys [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2226.88s)]
*  or something like that, that's different than if you're fucking like her friend [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2230.16s)]
*  in the community because now you're embarrassing her [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2233.2799999999997s)]
*  and there's this whole. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2235.44s)]
*  Well, what I'll tell you is the difference between men and women is when a woman gets [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2236.4s)]
*  caught cheating, the man's first question is, did you fuck him? [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2242.88s)]
*  Wow. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2246.96s)]
*  And the woman's first question is, do you love her? [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2247.36s)]
*  Do you love her? [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2249.44s)]
*  Because that's the distinction. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2250.96s)]
*  And I will tell you in my experience, and again, don't fucking pillory me for this one, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2253.6s)]
*  guys. I didn't make up gender roles. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2257.76s)]
*  I'm just observing what's sitting on the other side of the fucking desk. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2259.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2261.36s)]
*  But what I'm not talking about you guys, I mean the comments, what, which the reality is [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2261.84s)]
*  that women are much more forgiving of those things because I think there is a part of them [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2267.6800000000003s)]
*  that goes, yeah, you're a fucking idiot. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2272.32s)]
*  You're a guy. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2273.84s)]
*  Like you're an idiot, you're a guy. Like this had nothing to do with me. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2274.48s)]
*  And there's so much to lose. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2277.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2279.04s)]
*  That you losing so much. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2279.6000000000004s)]
*  Whereas a man allowing his wife to cheat, he's lost his entire identity as a man. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2282.0s)]
*  But what's hard for me. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2286.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't think a woman loses anything as a woman when we cheat because the expectation of us [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2286.7200000000003s)]
*  is we're a bunch of fucking idiots that can't stop putting our dick and stuff. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2290.4s)]
*  They spend the majority of their lives telling guys that they don't want to fuck them. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2293.6000000000004s)]
*  So when they do, you must have wanted that shit. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2297.36s)]
*  The problem I have too is. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2300.0800000000004s)]
*  Real quick, Bill Maher, when I was doing this podcast with Bill Maher, he had a funny idea. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2302.0s)]
*  He was like, I often times hear female rappers say this thing like, I'm going to steal your man. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2305.2000000000003s)]
*  Like I'm going to steal your man. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2309.52s)]
*  And it's like, oh no. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2310.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2312.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2313.2000000000003s)]
*  That's the hardest. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2313.68s)]
*  How the hell you stole me? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2314.88s)]
*  Like this is the easiest thing in the world. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2316.96s)]
*  That's the hard task to do. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2319.52s)]
*  No, it's the easiest thing in the world. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2321.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2322.2400000000002s)]
*  Stealing somebody's girl is tough because you're taking away from a life you really want. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2322.64s)]
*  That's why I've always said the whole thing of a hall pass [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2326.88s)]
*  is the fucking dumbest deal in the world for men. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2330.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2332.56s)]
*  Because like, think about it. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2332.96s)]
*  If I say, all right, with my girl, if I say to her, like, all right, we each have a hall pass. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2334.48s)]
*  And she goes, OK, mine's Bradley Cooper. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2339.92s)]
*  And I say, OK, mine is, I don't know, Angelina Jolie or whatever. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2342.48s)]
*  She can fuck him. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2346.0s)]
*  The chances of him, if I meet her in the first class and I go, listen, just so you know, [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2346.56s)]
*  I have permission if you want to go have a little something. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2352.88s)]
*  But the chances of like a guy being like, you know, she went, listen, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2355.76s)]
*  I'm allowed to suck your dick right now. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2359.04s)]
*  You're like, I got 10 minutes. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2360.48s)]
*  It's never a good deal for the men. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2361.92s)]
*  Well, because we take the wrong people. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2365.52s)]
*  I'm being ambitious. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2366.88s)]
*  You've got to pick a camera setup. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2367.68s)]
*  Jet blue flight attendant and then some gay guy with tits. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2369.92s)]
*  And you're just like, that's the one who I'm going to cheat. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2374.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's all. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2377.92s)]
*  Something attainable. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2378.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2379.2799999999997s)]
*  But it really is one of those things that I think with women, what I do feel bad for women about [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2380.08s)]
*  is the women who have been cheated on. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2386.16s)]
*  They've said, okay, you know what? [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2388.4s)]
*  I'm going to look past this. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2389.68s)]
*  We have kids and stuff like that. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2390.56s)]
*  No, what I actually feel bad is that how other women, they have to suffer in silence [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2392.64s)]
*  because if they told any of the women in their life, I'm taking him back, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2399.2799999999997s)]
*  they would be fucking excorated. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2405.12s)]
*  They would be destroyed. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2407.68s)]
*  Like you ever want to read vitriolic comments? [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2409.36s)]
*  Any woman who takes back a man who cheated on her, like Beyonce got way more shit than Jay-Z. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2413.28s)]
*  She had to put out a whole album. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2419.36s)]
*  She had to beat him up somehow to have some redemption. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2421.76s)]
*  And again, from other women, because women were like, how dare you take him because it has to. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2425.28s)]
*  She left him. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2431.44s)]
*  That social media. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2432.32s)]
*  She'd have been the girl boss. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2432.8s)]
*  She'd have been the, yeah, he has no right to do that. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2434.56s)]
*  Wouldn't that be the same for men though? [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2437.28s)]
*  If a girl cheats and a guy takes her back, wouldn't guys be fucking... [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2438.56s)]
*  You get pillory for it. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2441.8399999999997s)]
*  So you have to suffer in silence. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2444.3999999999996s)]
*  You have to not tell people that this happened, which by the way, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2445.6s)]
*  it is a hard thing for people to come back from, rebuild trust from. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2448.3999999999996s)]
*  People do it all the time. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2451.2799999999997s)]
*  People do it all the time. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2452.96s)]
*  And usually what it is, they come into my office. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2454.08s)]
*  They're like, I want to kill him. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2456.08s)]
*  I want him out. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2457.4399999999996s)]
*  I want to file tomorrow. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2458.16s)]
*  And I have done this long enough. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2459.6s)]
*  And I'll go, okay, listen, if we want to do it, and on Monday we'll still do it, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2461.2799999999997s)]
*  but let's just just happen. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2464.96s)]
*  Just hang out a sec. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2466.16s)]
*  Let's take a breath. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2466.64s)]
*  Let's get our ducks in order. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2467.9199999999996s)]
*  And usually a couple days later, they'll call me and they'll say, you know what? [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2470.2400000000002s)]
*  We talked and then we're going to go talk to someone. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2473.44s)]
*  We're going to go to counselor. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2475.44s)]
*  And very often I never hear from that person again. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2476.6400000000003s)]
*  And I think that they figure out a way to navigate. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2478.6400000000003s)]
*  Do kids make a difference? [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2480.7200000000003s)]
*  Kids make a huge difference. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2482.4s)]
*  Massive. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2483.0400000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2483.44s)]
*  I mean, look, you have a tremendous reason to keep it together if you have children. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2484.0s)]
*  You're fully going in best case scenario, you're going to lose a huge chunk of time [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2489.6000000000004s)]
*  with your children. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2494.0800000000004s)]
*  You're going to lose the support of a co-parent. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2495.1200000000003s)]
*  I mean, it's difficult to raise a child with two people. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2497.52s)]
*  It's difficult to do with one person. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2500.08s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2502.08s)]
*  It's almost impossible. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2502.4s)]
*  It's like, unless you have help, I can't believe it. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2503.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's very challenging. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2505.52s)]
*  So I think that people have the more skin you have in the game, you know? [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2506.64s)]
*  Like that's why I always say like the ultra people say like, oh, it must be really hard [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2510.8s)]
*  representing like super wealthy people. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2514.32s)]
*  I'm like, no, they have enough money to buy another fucking house and another apartment [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2515.76s)]
*  and another place in the Hampton. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2520.48s)]
*  So they each have one and they have nannies that travel between both places. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2521.68s)]
*  So their stability for the kids. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2525.36s)]
*  Sometimes they keep the kid in the same house and the parents. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2526.64s)]
*  Nesting. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2530.0s)]
*  Yeah, nesting. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2530.64s)]
*  The parents, the kids have the nest. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2531.3599999999997s)]
*  So the kids never have to leave, which is really awesome. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2532.8799999999997s)]
*  The parents each get an apartment and they kind of come back and forth with the kids. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2534.96s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2538.96s)]
*  You know, look, we don't know. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2539.3599999999997s)]
*  That's like a huge privilege. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2539.92s)]
*  How many people can own a free home? [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2541.7599999999998s)]
*  But that is probably the best for the children because now they're not packing a bag literally [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2544.3199999999997s)]
*  every single week. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2547.68s)]
*  You know what I'll tell you is we don't know who discovered water, but it probably wasn't a fish. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2548.48s)]
*  Like when a kid grows up in an environment where mom was here, dad was here, and I spent time with [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2552.96s)]
*  each other, that's just all they know. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2558.0s)]
*  Like, OK, that's how it was. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2559.6000000000004s)]
*  Like when a kid's 10, 11, 12, and suddenly mom and dad who were living together are living [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2561.04s)]
*  in different places, that's traumatic. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2565.28s)]
*  That's challenging. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2566.5600000000004s)]
*  But if you're a little, you're a two-year-old and now it's like, OK, dad lives here, mom lives [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2567.6800000000003s)]
*  here, and I spent. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2572.32s)]
*  When you ask that person when they're in high school, like, what was your childhood like, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2573.2000000000003s)]
*  they'll say like, I don't know. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2576.48s)]
*  Like, it was, yeah, I lived with mom sometimes, dad sometimes. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2577.84s)]
*  I spent time with both of them. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2580.32s)]
*  Also, if you grew up in like New York City where divorce is pretty popular, it's probably [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2581.7599999999998s)]
*  easier for you to do. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2587.36s)]
*  But I agree with you, like, the kids can be absolutely destroyed if it happens when they're [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2588.24s)]
*  a little bit older, a little bit smarter and aware of what's going on. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2592.16s)]
*  I see a lot of divorce where the kids are kind of being used as like a leverage tool. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2595.04s)]
*  That's really fucked up. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2600.08s)]
*  Is there every time where you like step in, you go, why are we punishing the kids? [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2601.52s)]
*  I try to do that a lot. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2605.44s)]
*  I mean, what I always say is that the person who cares less about the children has tactical [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2605.6s)]
*  advantage in a custody proceeding in the same way that a bank robber has tactical advantage [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2611.04s)]
*  over the cops because they can shoot innocent bystanders. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2616.56s)]
*  Like the cops can't just spray with a machine gun and hope they'll hit one of the robbers. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2619.36s)]
*  But robbers can just spray and hope they hit the cops like they can run over the sidewalk. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2623.36s)]
*  How would that work in the court proceeding, for example? [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2629.36s)]
*  You know, by insidiously alienating a child from their co-parent, you know, by injecting [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2632.08s)]
*  into the child like a dislike or a fear of your co-parent so that you get custody. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2638.8s)]
*  I mean, by the way, most of the time this isn't just done as a vindictive thing. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2643.36s)]
*  It's also done for financial reasons because if you have the children more than 50% of the time, [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2647.2000000000003s)]
*  you get child support. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2651.1200000000003s)]
*  And that's a big chunk of money. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2652.5600000000004s)]
*  New York state, one kid, 17% of your gross income, less FICA. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2654.0s)]
*  Two kids is 25%. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2657.1200000000003s)]
*  Three kids, 29%. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2658.48s)]
*  Four kids, 31%. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2659.76s)]
*  So like the gross income. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2661.44s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2664.5600000000004s)]
*  That's before taxes. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2665.04s)]
*  So if you're spending 50% of taxes, like say you're some rich person, 31% is going to your wife and [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2666.32s)]
*  the children. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2672.0s)]
*  You have four kids. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2672.48s)]
*  If you have four kids and only if she gets them 51% of time, you still got to provide for your life. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2673.1200000000003s)]
*  It'd be a lot cheaper to just hire a nanny and fight for custody. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2678.8s)]
*  And that's what ends up happening. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2682.56s)]
*  And there's alimony that goes along with that. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2683.6000000000004s)]
*  There can be spousal support. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2685.1200000000003s)]
*  But think about it. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2686.56s)]
*  So if it goes to 50% and you hire the nanny, at 51% to 50%, there's no real difference in the [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2687.04s)]
*  amount that you're going to see your children. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2694.48s)]
*  But the difference in the amount that you're giving to that woman who now you hate and hates you. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2696.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2701.6000000000004s)]
*  Wow. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2702.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2702.96s)]
*  And by the way, there's no one like doing an accounting to make sure it's spent on the kids. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2703.28s)]
*  That's the other thing you hear a lot. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2708.48s)]
*  Sometimes it's like that was meant to be for the kids and it was used for the tit job. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2709.36s)]
*  Or it was used for like sex toys with the new boyfriend. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2713.6800000000003s)]
*  And how is that decided who gets custody? [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2717.52s)]
*  In New York, we have what's called the best interest standard, but most states have some [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2720.8s)]
*  variation of that. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2723.92s)]
*  And it's as subjective and crazy as you'd think it is. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2724.7200000000003s)]
*  Like it's it really is full context storytelling. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2727.2000000000003s)]
*  Like you go in as a lawyer and you just have to try to tell the story of why your client [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2730.56s)]
*  is stable, consistent, reliable, and a good parent and why the other side is less than. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2734.4s)]
*  And this may be a New York thing, but I always hear that the mother always gets the custody. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2739.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2743.04s)]
*  I mean, that's a pretty common misconception. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2743.2000000000003s)]
*  And I understand why people say that because I think women fight much harder for custody [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2745.28s)]
*  than men do. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2752.56s)]
*  And I'll tell you why. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2753.52s)]
*  Like, and I probably don't even need to, but I'll point out. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2754.72s)]
*  If you and I, all right, if we meet in real life, we're just out in a bar and you say [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2758.08s)]
*  to me, so Jim, tell me about yourself. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2763.04s)]
*  And I say, well, you know, I'm a lawyer, I'm divorced, I have my kids, they live with their [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2764.64s)]
*  mom. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2768.4s)]
*  Every other weekend I have them. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2769.04s)]
*  You'd go, oh, divorced dad, nice guy, probably. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2771.28s)]
*  I'm a woman. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2774.48s)]
*  You don't have those kids. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2775.68s)]
*  I have two kids. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2776.64s)]
*  They live with their dad. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2777.6s)]
*  I see them every what the fuck is wrong with her? [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2778.8s)]
*  Social drugs, mental health. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2781.36s)]
*  And by the way, like, I mean, go on Instagram, hashtag mom life. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2783.28s)]
*  Like, believe me, like I've represented some some co-parents of celebrities that like these [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2787.28s)]
*  people are opiated out of their minds. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2792.2400000000002s)]
*  But when it's time to take that kid out like a Birkin bag, you know, they bring them out [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2794.48s)]
*  and they're like, oh, I'm a mom. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2798.88s)]
*  And then they're like back to, all right, take this fucking kid away. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2800.48s)]
*  You know, and they can care less. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2802.6400000000003s)]
*  But it's optics, you know, whereas for a man, if you go, yeah, the kids live with their [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2804.1600000000003s)]
*  mom, people go, oh, yeah, well, of course, the kids live with their mom. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2808.2400000000002s)]
*  So that's where I think that comes from. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2810.5600000000004s)]
*  But the truth is, like men get custody all the time. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2812.64s)]
*  The maternal presumption was eradicated years ago. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2815.3599999999997s)]
*  There used to be something called what was called the tender years doctrine, which was [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2817.7599999999998s)]
*  if a child was under the age of seven, you let the mom automatically got custody unless [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2821.44s)]
*  you could show she was an unfit mother. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2826.4s)]
*  That was eradicated in the 1980s. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2828.72s)]
*  But, you know, some of the judges like have been around since then. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2830.7999999999997s)]
*  So they remember that. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2833.7599999999998s)]
*  And judges remember judges are human. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2834.72s)]
*  Like judges are people. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2836.56s)]
*  So they have the same bias as anybody else has. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2837.8399999999997s)]
*  So sometimes he's the judge is a divorced dad who's like, dads are just as good as moms. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2840.32s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2844.56s)]
*  Sometimes they're a pissed off ex-wife of somebody and they're like, fuck that guy [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2845.44s)]
*  because they're taking out, you know, these are humans. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2849.76s)]
*  I guess we take a break for a second. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=2851.84s)]

*  You know, this wasn't a thing. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3098.56s)]
*  And this was not the dude you would think. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3099.68s)]
*  Like, there was nothing feminine about this guy. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3101.8399999999997s)]
*  Like, I was way more feminine than this guy. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3104.56s)]
*  And he was like, yeah, you know, I've always felt this way. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3107.2799999999997s)]
*  And I, you know, and he did. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3110.96s)]
*  Sure enough, he transitioned pretty quickly. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3112.8799999999997s)]
*  And like many people who transition, initially, he looked like a guy wearing a wig. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3114.96s)]
*  Like he looked like a dude who was, you know, he'd started hormones. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3120.08s)]
*  And when we went to court, the judge actually issued a temporary decision saying [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3123.3599999999997s)]
*  that he was allowed to see his kids as long as he dressed like a man when he saw his kids. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3127.7599999999998s)]
*  Now, if a judge did that now, they'd be thrown off the bench. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3132.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3135.44s)]
*  And I possibly jailed for a hate crime. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3135.9199999999996s)]
*  But back then, that was considered a perfectly acceptable resolution. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3138.56s)]
*  Funny PS to that story, by the way. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3142.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3144.7999999999997s)]

*  colleagues and I look off to the far left and I see a very attractive woman staring at me. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3150.96s)]
*  And I'm thinking like, you still got it, sex. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3157.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3158.96s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3160.56s)]
*  And she's just smiling at me. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3161.44s)]
*  So I'm like, do I know her? [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3162.88s)]
*  This is weird. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3164.32s)]
*  So I finished this conversation. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3165.12s)]
*  I kind of do the peacocking thing where I'm like, all right, man, catch you later. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3166.4s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm going to walk past her. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3169.2s)]

*  And I was like, I'll just take the bike. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3251.6800000000003s)]
*  What about cash? [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3252.88s)]
*  Like just straight cash? [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3253.76s)]
*  People try to pay me in cash all the time. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3254.48s)]
*  And you say no. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3256.4s)]
*  I know. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3256.96s)]
*  I'll accept cash. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3257.36s)]
*  But I do tell them, like, there's rules about how we take cash. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3258.2400000000002s)]
*  And then we have to report it if it's over $10,000. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3261.44s)]
*  But oh, I've had people who come in with like $300,000 in cash. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3263.84s)]
*  And they're like, can I just pay my bill with this? [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3267.2000000000003s)]
*  And when you say to them, yes, but I have to then report to the bank where I got it. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3268.96s)]
*  And suddenly they're like, no problem. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3272.48s)]
*  I'll bring you a check. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3273.84s)]
*  You know, and instead. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3274.56s)]
*  OK, so you're by the book when it comes to payment. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3275.84s)]
*  You have to be as a lawyer. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3278.0s)]
*  I mean, a lot of lawyers are Wild West with that shit. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3279.04s)]
*  You know, like not who's going to stay in a hotel. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3281.12s)]
*  He's almost retired. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3284.2400000000002s)]
*  He's like, I didn't let it go. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3285.2s)]
*  Not lawyers who are paying trillions outside of town. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3286.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3289.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3289.68s)]
*  No, we went to a hotel. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3290.16s)]
*  That's it. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3291.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3292.16s)]
*  I have some class here. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3292.64s)]
*  I'm a cheap date. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3293.6s)]
*  No, I feel like a lot of lawyers. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3294.72s)]
*  What's interesting is if you read the disciplinary opinions for lawyers, [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3297.68s)]
*  it's really funny because they fuck up lawyers and disbar lawyers for financial stuff really fast. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3301.44s)]
*  Almost like you read that they publish these decisions. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3309.52s)]
*  It's like runs chills through all of us. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3311.84s)]
*  But you read it and they're like, this lawyer had sex with three of his clients. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3313.6000000000004s)]
*  He, you know, had a serious cocaine problem and he told three of his clients that cases [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3318.1600000000003s)]
*  were resolved when in fact they weren't, you know, suspended for two weeks from the practice of law. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3322.88s)]
*  And then they're like, this guy did not report $23 that he received in cash disbarred. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3328.64s)]
*  And you're like, fuck. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3334.64s)]
*  The money thing is the biggest thing. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3336.48s)]
*  So lawyers who play it fast and loose with that stuff, like you're not going to be around. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3338.16s)]
*  Have you ever hooked up with any clients? [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3341.6s)]
*  No, no. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3343.92s)]
*  And I have to tell you. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3345.04s)]
*  Have they thrown it at you? [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3345.92s)]
*  No, for real. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3347.2799999999997s)]
*  You never circled back after you got the good divorce, got the pay and I was like, yeah, [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3348.7999999999997s)]
*  we can spend his money together. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3352.72s)]
*  I will tell you why. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3354.0s)]
*  Because I'm trying to figure out how to say this without offending any of my existing clients. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3355.52s)]
*  The truth is that if you represent a woman in her divorce, you will never fucking want to date her. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3361.52s)]
*  Like you see the worst of this person. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3368.48s)]
*  Wow. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3370.7200000000003s)]
*  Like, like, you know, there's a rule. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3371.12s)]
*  That's a good lie. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3373.36s)]
*  I know. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3373.92s)]
*  That's a good lie. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3374.16s)]
*  That's a good lie. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3375.04s)]
*  He's a good lawyer. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3375.6s)]
*  I almost believed that. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3376.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3378.32s)]
*  There's a rule in New York. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3379.12s)]
*  There's a rule in New York. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3380.48s)]
*  Matrimonial lawyers are not, we're the only lawyers that are not allowed to have sex with our clients. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3382.24s)]
*  It's a rule. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3386.56s)]
*  Like if you do a real estate closer for someone, you can fuck them. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3387.04s)]
*  But if you're a divorce lawyer, a domestic relations lawyer, you cannot have sex with [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3389.6s)]
*  your clients for six months after the representation is concluded. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3393.52s)]
*  You should have said that. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3396.48s)]
*  It's just illegal. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3397.28s)]
*  No, we're saying do you circle the block? [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3398.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3400.48s)]
*  But I'm telling you something. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3402.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3403.28s)]
*  Whoever wrote that rule. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3407.92s)]
*  Jimmy did three. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3408.8s)]
*  Whoever wrote that rule was not a divorce lawyer because you don't even want to fucking [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3409.76s)]
*  talk to these people, much less fuck them. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3415.44s)]
*  This guy is good. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3417.36s)]
*  Some of these women too, they have a hero thing they've put on you that is so unhealthy. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3419.6800000000003s)]
*  His first time starts to sweat all. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3426.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3427.84s)]
*  Can we take a break? [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3429.84s)]
*  I can call my lawyer. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3432.1600000000003s)]
*  So we know you've never fucked a client or anything, but hypothetically speaking, [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3433.84s)]
*  if you ever were to circle the block seven months later, eight months later, and now [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3437.12s)]
*  that girl has tons of money that you won for her and she's really grateful, what would [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3440.88s)]
*  that be like hypothetically? [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3446.3199999999997s)]
*  What is that head like? [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3447.7599999999998s)]
*  Hypothetically speaking, like when you just got her $100 million. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3450.4s)]
*  I mean, look, it'd probably be fantastic. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3454.0s)]
*  Yeah, it'd be a lot of money. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3456.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3457.2s)]
*  She's got enough money to do better than me at that point. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3460.24s)]
*  No, but she's really grateful. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3462.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3464.08s)]
*  I mean, look, they do. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3464.58s)]
*  What I'll tell you is your female clients fall in love with you. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3465.12s)]
*  They do. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3467.44s)]
*  But it's not you that they're in love with. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3467.84s)]
*  You're their hero in this situation. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3469.7599999999998s)]
*  Of course. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3470.96s)]
*  And so you have to have the presence of mind. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3472.0s)]
*  It's like when you're a college professor, like, yeah, of course, you got 20 something [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3475.44s)]
*  year old girls who are like coming to your office hours and they're into you. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3479.36s)]
*  Of course, there's a part of your brain that goes, oh my God, are you kidding me? [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3483.2799999999997s)]
*  This is fucking... [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3486.96s)]
*  But the truth is they think you know shit you don't know. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3487.7599999999998s)]
*  They think that you're this genius person. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3490.72s)]
*  You're just a fucking person. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3492.56s)]
*  So I really don't... [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3494.48s)]
*  They're not in love with you. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3496.7999999999997s)]
*  I think like 20 of them, you fuck. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3498.24s)]
*  In two decades, in two decades. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3505.44s)]
*  Bro, you're out of luck. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3506.72s)]

*  I know some things. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3514.56s)]
*  I know some things. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3515.6s)]
*  Well, here's what I'll say. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3516.3199999999997s)]
*  I know a court clerk in Manhattan family court. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3517.04s)]
*  She knows some stories about you. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3520.48s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3521.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3522.18s)]
*  We do research on this. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3526.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3527.22s)]
*  That's really why I was launched that one. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3528.8999999999996s)]
*  That's how you get 50% off. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3532.5s)]
*  It's never pro bono. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3534.2599999999998s)]
*  But that's how you get 50% off. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3535.46s)]
*  I'm gonna give you my card. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3538.74s)]

*  But they should. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3543.14s)]
*  Come over. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3544.1s)]
*  But they should if it's like a horrible divorce and you free this woman from this oppressive [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3546.66s)]
*  man and then you take the majority of money, give it to him and the house and all this other stuff. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3551.7s)]
*  And she can't just, you know. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3556.3399999999997s)]

*  No, Andrew's whole goal is to have her make more money than me anyway. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3635.38s)]
*  Who cares? [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3637.94s)]
*  Look, what I'll tell you is, first of all, I don't think anybody wants their marriage [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3638.8999999999996s)]
*  to continue, their spouse to stay in the marriage because they don't want to give up half their shit. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3644.18s)]
*  That's like a bad incentive. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3650.02s)]
*  You want someone to stay married to you because they want to be married to you. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3652.1s)]
*  They think you add value to their life, that they enjoy your company, that more often than not, [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3654.5s)]
*  they're glad they're with you, whatever. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3658.9799999999996s)]
*  Any number of justifications. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3660.74s)]
*  But to say, well, I'm with him because I don't want to have to give away half my shit. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3662.8999999999996s)]
*  You got broke boy mentality. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3666.8199999999997s)]
*  He's got broke boy mentality. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3668.82s)]
*  He's like a child. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3670.02s)]
*  He's like a big child. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3670.7400000000002s)]
*  So if I were to get a prenup, what should I include in it? [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3673.7000000000003s)]
*  I think the easiest prenup is the one that I would encourage most people to have, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3676.58s)]
*  which is I call it the yours, mine, and ours. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3679.86s)]
*  If it's in your name, asset or liability, you keep it. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3681.6200000000003s)]
*  If it's in her name, asset or liability, she keeps it. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3684.6600000000003s)]
*  If it's in joint names, you split it 50-50. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3686.82s)]
*  That's it. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3688.7400000000002s)]
*  Clean. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3689.1400000000003s)]
*  Here's what I'll tell you. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3689.46s)]
*  All three of you have a prenup. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3691.6200000000003s)]
*  The government wrote it. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3693.3s)]
*  The state legislature wrote your fucking prenup. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3695.1400000000003s)]
*  And by the way, you think that's a good idea? [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3697.3s)]
*  You ever been to the DMV? [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3701.1400000000003s)]
*  You ever walk into the DMV and go, these people should be in charge of everything. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3702.9s)]
*  They're great at it. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3706.98s)]
*  This is really good. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3708.26s)]
*  But the reality is, the government is the worst fucking people to write your prenup. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3709.3s)]
*  To whom, though? [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3713.94s)]
*  To whom? [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3714.5s)]

*  Because my attitude is, look, all kidding aside, every marriage has a prenup. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3767.54s)]
*  It's either one that's written by the government or it's written by the two people that like [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3771.4599999999996s)]

*  And that's all the prenup is. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3783.14s)]
*  A prenup is just saying, look, there's going to come a time. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3784.26s)]
*  Like, if you're getting married, it's smart to say to your spouse, when you're getting [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3788.5800000000004s)]

*  I promise. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3797.5400000000004s)]
*  It's probably going to be my fault. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3798.34s)]
*  I'm going to say some dumb shit. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3799.3s)]
*  I say dumb shit. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3800.26s)]
*  It happens. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3801.0600000000004s)]
*  When we get in that fight, what should that look like? [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3802.1800000000003s)]
*  Do you need a minute? [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3805.38s)]
*  Should I give you some space? [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3806.1800000000003s)]
*  Like, if I force you to talk about it, is it going to turn into a whole thing? [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3807.46s)]
*  Or do we need to take care of this now because you don't want to go to bed angry? [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3810.5s)]
*  Because the worst time to learn how to fight is when you're in a fucking fight. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3814.26s)]
*  That's the worst time to learn how to do a fight. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3818.58s)]
*  So that's all the prenup is. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3821.14s)]
*  A prenup is saying, look, we're getting along right now. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3822.7400000000002s)]
*  We have an abundance of goodwill between the two of us. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3825.06s)]
*  If, God forbid, in the highly unlikely 56% percent, the highly unlikely chance that we [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3827.86s)]
*  would get divorced, what would that look like? [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3835.38s)]
*  And by the way, there's a way to say it that I think has a tremendous amount of big dick [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3837.2200000000003s)]
*  energy, which is to say, you know what? [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3841.06s)]
*  You're my woman. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3843.62s)]
*  I want you to feel safe. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3844.5s)]
*  You can't be a love unless you feel safe. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3846.18s)]
*  And the way I want you to feel safe is I want you to feel safe from everyone, including me. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3849.54s)]
*  So what is dumb? [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3856.9s)]
*  We're going to go live. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3857.7s)]
*  Well, I mean, the marriage. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3861.14s)]
*  She's like, I got this. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3866.9s)]
*  This is simple. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3868.18s)]
*  You know, actual question, yours, mine, and ours. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3870.18s)]
*  How does that go once you're married? [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3872.8199999999997s)]
*  Everything is just going to go hours, right? [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3874.1s)]
*  You're going to buy the house. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3875.7s)]
*  It's going to be our name. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3876.5s)]
*  You're going to buy the cars. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3877.2999999999997s)]
*  It's going to be our name. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3878.02s)]
*  Conversation you got to have. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3878.5s)]
*  Like, look, you know this as a married man. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3879.62s)]
*  If you can't have difficult conversations with your spouse, don't get fucking married. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3882.74s)]
*  Like part of being married is having hard conversations. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3886.74s)]
*  How do you feel personally? [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3889.46s)]
*  Let's say you and your wife are both working. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3892.5s)]
*  Wife decides to not work to raise the child. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3895.54s)]
*  Sure. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3898.02s)]
*  Common. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3898.42s)]
*  Maybe I'm telling you how I feel without asking you how you feel. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3900.98s)]
*  But like there's a part of me that goes, okay, well, anything, first of all, [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3903.46s)]
*  anything I don't have a pre-emptive obviously, is there anything that we own as both of ours? [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3907.62s)]
*  But like, I think that if she's going to make that sacrifice and that decision, [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3910.42s)]
*  I think she's entitled to half of everything. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3914.02s)]
*  Who would disagree with that? [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3916.98s)]
*  Okay, good because I think there's sometimes people. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3918.02s)]
*  Totally fair. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3919.62s)]
*  Okay. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3920.34s)]
*  And I think sometimes people are like, well, if you're making the money, that's all you. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3920.98s)]
*  It's like, yeah, yeah, but you're able to do that because somebody's looking after [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3923.78s)]
*  the child. Now their circumstances, like your guys circumstances, they don't have a kid yet, [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3927.62s)]
*  right? So like he's making money and you know, she, your wife could be making money. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3932.74s)]
*  So he might have an argument to go, well, I'm going to keep all of this because you could be [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3936.8199999999997s)]
*  working. But I do think once you add children into the mix, there's a very different. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3940.58s)]
*  But I totally agree and I think any reasonable person would. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3945.54s)]
*  But just to push back on that thought a little bit. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3948.42s)]
*  What I would say to you is, okay, but there's got to be a stop loss somewhere in there, right? [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3951.46s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3955.46s)]
*  There's got to be some sense of like, what is that obligation? [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3956.34s)]
*  Cause look, at the end of the day, we all owe each other things when we make decisions like this. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3959.3s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3964.5s)]
*  Like in some ways, in some ways, you're, you wouldn't have the success you have if it wasn't [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3965.06s)]
*  for your wife. She supported you. She's helped build it. Okay. Absolutely. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3970.5s)]
*  Your wife wouldn't be the person she is if it wasn't for her mother. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3973.78s)]
*  So what do you owe her mother? How much? [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3977.38s)]
*  I think at least half. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3979.06s)]
*  Okay. Her mother wouldn't be the person she was if it wasn't for her mother. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3979.94s)]
*  She needs to have to. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3984.02s)]
*  We owe grandma. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3984.58s)]
*  Okay. So the math on this gets a little fuzzy. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3985.62s)]
*  They all need half. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3987.7799999999997s)]
*  So the reality is. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3988.5s)]
*  Everybody. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3989.7s)]
*  Look, I think fundamentally. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3990.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, they need half of her. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3992.74s)]
*  Value is an important thing. You know, I just watched your special, you know, [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3993.62s)]
*  and I got a huge kick out, especially as a divorce lawyer, the shit we laugh at. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=3998.42s)]
*  But when you said the thing about, you know, like, [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4001.7s)]
*  We made a baby. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4005.06s)]
*  We made a baby. And you're like, oh, just like we made this money. Like it's our money. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4005.8599999999997s)]
*  Like, okay, look, at the end of the day, we know you earn more than her. Right? [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4009.7s)]
*  Okay. So we don't why do we have to be afraid to say that out loud? [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4013.86s)]
*  Like marriage is an economy. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4016.82s)]
*  That's not a dirty word. An economy is we're exchanging value. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4018.82s)]
*  We're giving and receiving. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4023.3s)]
*  And an economy does not require that everyone gives and receives the exact same fucking thing. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4024.6600000000003s)]
*  You can say like Steve Jobs, Steve Woznak, without Steve Woznak, [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4029.46s)]
*  Steve Jobs would have a lot of cool ideas he couldn't do shit with. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4034.34s)]
*  And if it wasn't for Steve Jobs, he was actually a dude in his garage making shit, [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4037.3s)]
*  but have no vision. So together they brought something to fruition. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4040.82s)]
*  Same thing with the marriage. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4044.5800000000004s)]
*  There's no question. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4045.54s)]
*  Does she get half? Does that really make sense? Half of everything? [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4046.34s)]
*  So there's no question of whether what you're saying makes sense. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4050.1800000000003s)]
*  I think the difficult emotional battle, which you've probably done thousands of times, [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4054.26s)]
*  is putting a dollar value on what somebody brings to the table in a marriage. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4058.42s)]
*  Like what is the dollar value you're worth for raising our kid? [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4063.7000000000003s)]
*  That's a really difficult thing to do. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4066.6600000000003s)]
*  It feels icky to say. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4068.42s)]
*  It feels icky. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4069.1400000000003s)]
*  But it only feels icky for reasons that I think we could fix as a culture. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4069.78s)]
*  And that is that why can't we be honest? Like I'm a fan of honesty. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4073.86s)]
*  I'm a fan of just being, just say a quiet part out loud. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4078.34s)]
*  Like you give me, like, because here's the problem. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4081.5400000000004s)]
*  Here's the problem with modern marriage from a man's perspective, as far as I'm concerned. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4083.94s)]
*  Most of the marriages I know, okay, the man provides financially. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4088.26s)]
*  He protects, right? [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4093.0600000000004s)]
*  He's also there to be part of the family dynamic, taking care of kids, [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4095.78s)]
*  doing the things that he can do. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4099.06s)]
*  What does the woman bring? [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4100.580000000001s)]
*  She brings love, affection, a little bit of sweetness at the end of the day, you know, [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4101.860000000001s)]
*  sex, she brings, you know, taking care of kids. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4106.02s)]
*  Okay, if you get divorced, every single thing on that side of the man equation, [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4108.42s)]
*  he can be compelled to do by the power of the state. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4115.22s)]
*  And if he fails to do it, they can put him in jail. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4118.1s)]
*  Nothing on that other side, the female side, is enforceable at law. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4121.46s)]
*  The court cannot order her to be nice to you, to fuck you, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4126.34s)]
*  to be a wonderful mother to your children. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4129.54s)]
*  She can't, they can't force that. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4131.38s)]
*  So when you have a contract where only one side of it is enforceable with the power of the state, [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4133.38s)]
*  and the other side is not, my attitude is why don't we then just have an honest conversation [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4138.42s)]
*  about what we could both be afraid of and what value we want to attribute to something? [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4143.54s)]
*  But the court can't force you to protect your wife, [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4148.1s)]
*  and the court can't force you to make money for your family. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4150.02s)]
*  Well, economically, they can force you to. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4151.22s)]
*  They can force you to protect somebody. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4152.74s)]
*  I've had cases where the court says, okay, this person needs a security detail. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4154.9s)]
*  If it's a celebrity, they say these kids are going to need security for when they go to school, [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4159.299999999999s)]
*  things like that. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4162.66s)]
*  But the average person, can the court say you have to work to a dad? [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4163.0599999999995s)]
*  Well, what the courts say is, link and free the slaves. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4166.98s)]
*  Like if you're a, you know, if you're a, if you're a... [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4169.7s)]
*  You know, I didn't look old. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4176.0199999999995s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4177.139999999999s)]
*  Like, I like free the fucking guy. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4178.419999999999s)]
*  He jumps right in on that. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4179.86s)]
*  Not to link him, by the way. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4182.42s)]
*  He's one of the big ups. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4183.7s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4184.74s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4185.46s)]
*  What I'm saying, what I... [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4186.179999999999s)]
*  The dude in court. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4188.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4189.7s)]
*  You said her blood was like a bowl of oatmeal. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4194.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4196.66s)]
*  So, so if, if you, if your financial status at the moment you were getting divorced, [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4202.0199999999995s)]
*  determined what your obligations were, everybody quit their fucking job the minute [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4207.3s)]
*  they were getting divorced. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4210.5s)]
*  So what the courts say is like, if you're a brain surgeon, who now I'm getting divorced, [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4211.7s)]
*  I decided I want to be a fucking yoga teacher. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4215.62s)]
*  The court goes, look, link and free the slaves. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4217.86s)]
*  We can't make you be a brain surgeon. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4219.38s)]
*  You're just going to be a brain, you're going to be a yoga teacher who has the financial [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4220.82s)]
*  obligations of a brain surgeon. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4223.78s)]
*  So they impute an income to you. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4225.62s)]
*  And they'll say, whatever you do for a living, it's fine. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4227.9400000000005s)]
*  We can't force you to work, but we can give you financial obligations commensurate with [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4230.5s)]
*  your earning capacity, even if you're not earning at that capacity. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4234.1s)]
*  Which is actually really fucked up sometimes. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4237.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4240.26s)]
*  Like I had a client once who was an air traffic controller. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4240.66s)]
*  And if you know anything about air traffic controllers, like you can have a high school [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4243.860000000001s)]
*  education, be an air traffic controller, make like three, 400 grand a year. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4246.74s)]
*  Wow. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4250.58s)]
*  You can do really, really well. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4250.900000000001s)]
*  Well, this guy, his mother passed away. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4252.58s)]
*  He was very close with her. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4254.66s)]
*  He had a lot of anxiety and a lot of depression from it. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4256.18s)]
*  And he had to go on, on medication, psychiatric medication to like sort of deal with it. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4258.900000000001s)]
*  You're not allowed to be on benzodiazepines or certain psychiatric medications while [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4263.22s)]
*  you're in air traffic control. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4267.46s)]
*  So he was terminated from his position. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4268.34s)]
*  The next best job this guy could get, he made about 50 grand a year. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4270.9800000000005s)]
*  But the court was like, no, no, no. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4275.38s)]
*  You still got to pay. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4277.06s)]
*  Your earning capacity is $350,000 a year. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4277.62s)]
*  That's what you made. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4280.34s)]
*  And we were like, judge, what job can this guy get where he's going to make that amount [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4281.3s)]
*  of money? [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4285.54s)]
*  So it can sometimes, this is how guys end up in jail for not paying support. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4286.18s)]
*  So what'd he do? [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4289.62s)]
*  It's not their fault. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4289.860000000001s)]
*  So what'd he do? [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4290.58s)]
*  He suffered basically. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4293.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4294.9800000000005s)]
*  I mean, he had a very unfair child support award placed against him. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4295.22s)]
*  He ended up in jail a couple of times. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4298.5s)]
*  Because he was like selling drugs or something to make the money? [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4300.58s)]
*  No, he just was not, he didn't pay his support. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4303.46s)]
*  It's illegal to not pay child support. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4306.099999999999s)]
*  You can be put in jail. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4307.54s)]
*  But you can't go back for a readjustment if you haven't. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4308.419999999999s)]
*  We did after a certain amount of time and then it was granted. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4310.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4313.139999999999s)]
*  Like it was, the judge sort of didn't buy that this was not done intentionally. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4313.54s)]
*  Like we joke in our industry that, you know, we call it sudden income deficiency syndrome. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4317.86s)]
*  That it hits like nine out of 10 divorcing men. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4322.98s)]
*  Like guys are doing really great and then all of a sudden they're getting divorced. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4325.0599999999995s)]
*  And they're like, but this year is going to be bad. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4327.379999999999s)]
*  I'm not going to do well this year. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4328.98s)]
*  Like you work for Goldman Sachs. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4330.419999999999s)]
*  And you're like, yeah, but we're having a bad year. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4331.86s)]
*  It happens a lot that judges tend to look at people and go, you know, something tells me that [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4334.74s)]
*  if you're saying you're suddenly not doing well financially and it happens to be when [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4339.78s)]
*  you're getting divorced, there might be, you know, it's not a coincidence. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4342.82s)]
*  So I hear about these guys who don't pay child support. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4345.62s)]
*  You see that anecdotally, whatever. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4348.419999999999s)]
*  But then the saying I always hear is, well, courts are not in the collections business. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4350.259999999999s)]
*  So how do some guys seemingly not really pay kind of be unfair? [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4354.339999999999s)]
*  And then some guys well-intentioned. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4357.78s)]
*  So the courts, it depends on how bold the judge is. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4359.62s)]
*  I mean, what I'll tell you is a big, I'll give you some free legal advice. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4362.42s)]
*  If you ever have a child support obligation against you, which I hope you never do, [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4366.98s)]
*  and you have to pay it and you don't have the money to pay it. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4372.5s)]
*  Like if you're supposed to give her $2,000 a month and you don't have $2,000, [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4375.62s)]
*  don't give her $1,000. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4380.66s)]
*  Give her $1,226.37. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4383.38s)]
*  Because then when we get in front of the judge, we can say, judge, I had $1,000. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4387.38s)]
*  I borrowed $200 from my cousin. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4391.54s)]
*  I found $32 under the mats of my car. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4393.94s)]
*  This is everything I have. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4397.78s)]
*  Because what people do is if you gave $1,000, why didn't you give $1,001? [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4399.86s)]
*  If you gave $1,500, like a round number, it just looks like you're full of shit. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4403.7s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, look, we courts don't always, you know, again, because judges are human. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4409.46s)]
*  There are some judges, they will put you right the fuck in jail. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4414.5s)]
*  I've had clients let off in orange, you know, where the judge says, look, [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4417.38s)]
*  you got a week to pay this child support. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4420.74s)]
*  And if you don't bring a toothbrush when you come back to court, because I'm putting you away. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4422.66s)]
*  And they'll put some, they'll lock guys up. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4426.42s)]
*  They have what's called weekend jail, where on Friday after work, you check in and you stay in [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4428.58s)]
*  jail until Monday morning. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4433.62s)]
*  And then Monday morning. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4434.74s)]
*  So you can work and pay your child support. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4436.02s)]
*  Why does alimony exist? [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4440.1s)]
*  That's a great question. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4442.26s)]
*  This, I get child support. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4443.3s)]
*  I get. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4446.58s)]
*  It's splitting a bad set. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4447.06s)]
*  I get that. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4448.5s)]
*  You ever want to, you ever want to, real quick, [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4449.06s)]
*  you ever want to take a feminism out of a woman? [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4451.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4453.38s)]
*  Make her pay alimony. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4453.860000000001s)]
*  Dude, I think one of the coolest things in the White Lotus episode, they have these three [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4455.22s)]
*  different girls that make up this girl group. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4459.22s)]
*  It's phenomenal. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4461.14s)]
*  And each is an archetype of a woman at that age. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4461.9400000000005s)]
*  But one of them is paying child support or alimony. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4464.1s)]
*  But it is really interesting to see her reaction to it and how her friends react. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4467.9400000000005s)]
*  They hate it. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4471.62s)]
*  Yes. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4472.26s)]
*  Okay. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4472.74s)]
*  So can you explain one, what is alimony? [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4472.9800000000005s)]
*  And two, what is like the steelman argument for it? [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4474.74s)]
*  Like give me the, not like, oh, this sucks. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4477.3s)]
*  But what is the best case scenario? [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4479.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4481.38s)]
*  So alimony or spousal support or spousal maintenance, every state calls it something different, [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4482.02s)]
*  is a payment that's made from one former spouse to another. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4486.900000000001s)]
*  And it's intended to either rehabilitate their earning capacity so that they can kind of get [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4490.58s)]
*  on their feet or it's to roughly approximate the marital lifestyle for a certain period of time. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4494.9800000000005s)]
*  So it's very rarely what we call non-durational, meaning like you broke it, you bought it forever, [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4501.3s)]
*  you owe her the marital lifestyle. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4505.38s)]
*  There was a time where that was the way it was done, [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4506.66s)]
*  but it hasn't been that way for many, many years now. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4509.14s)]
*  So just so I can clarify, and everybody's listening, [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4511.46s)]
*  essentially there's this idea where if you're married and you have a certain lifestyle. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4513.46s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4517.78s)]
*  And there's a wide disparity in your incomes. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4518.1s)]
*  And there's a wide disparity in your potential income because the wife might not even be working. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4520.820000000001s)]
*  Correct. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4524.1s)]
*  It is up to the husband or the wife, whoever is the breadwinner, [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4524.74s)]
*  to maintain that lifestyle outside of the marriage. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4528.02s)]
*  Or some approximation of it for some period of time. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4530.5s)]
*  Got it. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4533.7s)]
*  So the steel man argument for it is the following. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4534.02s)]
*  There are economic decisions you make during your marriage and you make them as a couple. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4538.02s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4542.26s)]
*  So it is very difficult for everybody to be Beyonce. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4542.66s)]
*  Somebody's got to be Destiny's child. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4546.98s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4548.66s)]
*  You can't all be the Lionel Richie. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4549.22s)]
*  Somebody's got to be the comedians. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4551.22s)]
*  Sure. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4552.34s)]
*  So what you do is you say, okay, look, you're the star right now. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4552.66s)]
*  I'm going to stand back. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4556.98s)]
*  I'm going to take care of home. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4557.62s)]
*  I'm going to do my thing. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4558.5s)]
*  You, in the law, we call it diminished lifetime earning capacity, [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4559.7s)]
*  which basically means if a woman takes her late 20s or her 30s off from the workforce, [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4563.7s)]
*  because that's when you have kids. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4571.38s)]
*  You have kids in your 30s, kids in your 40s. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4572.5s)]
*  Very hard for her to get back into the workforce. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4574.42s)]
*  And when she gets back into the workforce, she's behind in the race. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4576.34s)]
*  So now she's still- [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4580.58s)]
*  Like if you join the New York City Marathon halfway through, [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4581.22s)]
*  you're not going to finish with everybody else, no matter how fucking fast you're on. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4584.74s)]
*  Just clarifying, behind in the race means when she was 20, [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4588.099999999999s)]
*  she would be in this beginner position. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4591.0599999999995s)]
*  I forget what that's called. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4592.66s)]
*  Like early entry position. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4593.86s)]
*  At 40, she should be like a VP or something. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4595.54s)]
*  So she hasn't worked for two decades. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4598.42s)]
*  She has to go back at that beginning position. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4600.099999999999s)]
*  So in the law, we call that diminished lifetime earning capacity. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4601.46s)]
*  And because it's a beginning position, the earning potential is very small. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4603.94s)]
*  And it'll never catch up because by the time she reaches the age she would have been at 40, [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4607.139999999999s)]
*  she's 60. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4612.9s)]
*  So she's closer to retirement. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4613.78s)]
*  So it's lost. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4614.98s)]
*  So what you're doing is you're sort of saying, okay, we're going to compensate for that. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4615.7s)]
*  That's the argument for it. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4619.0599999999995s)]
*  Now, I actually think that there's a lot of compassion and empathy in that idea. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4620.42s)]
*  That's the best steel man I've heard for it. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4626.5s)]
*  It makes a lot of sense. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4628.34s)]
*  I don't think most people would disagree with that. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4630.099999999999s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4632.5s)]
*  Here's the other question I have. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4633.0599999999995s)]
*  There are certain circumstances where there is a divorce, [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4634.26s)]
*  there's a payment and splitting of assets to the tune of like tens of millions of dollars. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4638.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4642.74s)]
*  And on top of that, an alimony payment, [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4643.3s)]
*  isn't there a way where it could be calculated that the assets themselves [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4646.26s)]
*  would assume that alimony payment? [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4652.82s)]
*  So what's really interesting is without realizing it, you've actually just joined [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4654.74s)]
*  the legislative committee of the New York State Bar Association because a few years ago, [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4659.22s)]
*  the domestic relations law was actually modified to reflect exactly that. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4663.86s)]
*  Okay. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4668.26s)]
*  I think that's worth it. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4668.5s)]
*  Where they said what they call it is the income creating capacity of assets received [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4668.82s)]
*  in equitable distribution. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4674.74s)]
*  Ah. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4675.78s)]
*  Now it is one of the factors. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4676.26s)]
*  When I started my career 25 years ago, that wasn't a factor. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4678.179999999999s)]
*  And then a lot of lawyers, myself included, were like, wait, she's getting $20 million. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4681.0599999999995s)]
*  Why does she also leave? [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4685.0599999999995s)]
*  Put it in treasuries at 5%. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4685.94s)]
*  She's got an income stream. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4688.9s)]
*  So the courts and the legislature caught up. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4690.58s)]
*  And now they say, yeah, if you're getting like, I just did a divorce where there was [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4693.139999999999s)]
*  an $800 million marital estate. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4696.099999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4697.94s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4698.26s)]
*  She actually had the audacity to ask for alimony. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4698.74s)]
*  I mean, the judge looked at it and went, listen, you're getting $400 million worth [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4700.98s)]
*  of assets. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4704.58s)]
*  You're going to be all right. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4705.0599999999995s)]
*  You know, we're not that can kick off income if you want it. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4706.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4709.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4709.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4709.7s)]
*  So, okay, I'm glad that they are making these adjustments. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4709.78s)]
*  And I think a lot of times you have to put in this legislation because you have to protect [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4712.42s)]
*  women, especially at a time where like they weren't able to work. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4715.38s)]
*  Yes. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4717.78s)]
*  Like a lot of these laws, I imagine, are put in times where like women aren't even [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4718.18s)]
*  part of the workforce. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4721.0599999999995s)]
*  That's when a lot of them came about. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4721.86s)]
*  And then the law is very slow to change because the way that our law works is it's [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4723.3s)]
*  sort of a living thing that modifies times and standards change. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4726.98s)]
*  As it should, but there is bureaucracy you have to go through and that's always going [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4731.0599999999995s)]
*  to be. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4733.94s)]
*  And by the way, to bring it back to where we started here, that's why I'm a fan of prenups. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4734.5s)]
*  Yes. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4740.02s)]
*  Yes. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4740.26s)]
*  Because if you're a fair person and your soon to be spouse is a fair person, couldn't [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4740.5s)]
*  you have this conversation? [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4746.02s)]
*  So this is really interesting. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4747.860000000001s)]
*  And just before, just to caveat it, like we all understand the emotional reaction to a [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4749.620000000001s)]
*  prenup and this idea of like the impending doom of your marriage before it even starts. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4754.740000000001s)]
*  So we get that. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4758.740000000001s)]
*  But it is interesting to attack the prenup, maybe attack is the wrong word, but approach [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4760.02s)]
*  the prenup with this idea that current legislation might not reflect what both parties feel is [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4764.9800000000005s)]
*  fair in a relationship, no matter how it goes. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4771.06s)]
*  And you can, if you love some of the current legislation, put that into the prenup. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4773.620000000001s)]
*  Sure. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4778.26s)]
*  If you don't, you can remove it. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4778.5s)]
*  So I think that's an interesting argument for it. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4780.18s)]
*  That's to me the best argument for it because here's the other problem. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4782.5s)]
*  Is there another contract that you've ever heard of? [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4785.700000000001s)]
*  That they can change the terms of the contract without even fucking telling you? [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4790.34s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4794.820000000001s)]
*  Like imagine if you bought or leased a car. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4795.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, this is really interesting. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4799.06s)]
*  And they said, oh, by the way, the state just decided we're going to change how the interest [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4800.42s)]
*  rate works and when you have to make the payments. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4805.3s)]
*  And you're not allowed to go, oh, well, then I'd like to opt out and return the car. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4807.22s)]
*  And they go, oh, no, no, no, you can't do that. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4810.9800000000005s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4812.42s)]
*  Like, so there's rules. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4813.14s)]
*  There's a prenup that was written for all three of your marriages. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4814.740000000001s)]
*  By the government. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4818.820000000001s)]
*  That can be changed unilaterally by people other than you and your wife and affect you forever. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4819.3s)]
*  So to me, my attitude is, listen, you could do a prenup one way and then three years later, [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4825.7s)]
*  do an addendum and modify it. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4830.66s)]
*  You can make it a living document just like you make your will. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4832.42s)]
*  You make your will at one point. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4835.14s)]
*  You make it again five years later. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4836.34s)]
*  You change it. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4837.860000000001s)]
*  You change it frequently. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4838.42s)]
*  I think the perception of it is a person with a lot of assets trying to make sure that the [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4839.06s)]
*  person that they're going to spend the rest of their life with never gets those assets [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4845.14s)]
*  in the event that the marriage doesn't work out, which is the goal of a lot of prenups. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4848.5s)]
*  And by the way, not an unfair concept. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4851.94s)]
*  Of course. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4853.86s)]
*  Like, let's, let's, let's. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4854.18s)]
*  You're bringing 100 million. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4855.22s)]
*  Let's go to an alternate reality. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4855.94s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4857.78s)]
*  I got to people quick because the next thing I do want to talk to you about is like, [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4858.1s)]
*  I think we're getting there. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4861.94s)]
*  Like, what happens with these like huge estates, these people that have like generational wealth? [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4863.14s)]
*  Anyway, can we take like two minute break? [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4868.74s)]
*  Listen, very important that we discuss March Madness. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4870.82s)]
*  There's nothing that is more important to the people in this podcast than amateur sports. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4873.46s)]
*  Yes. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4878.58s)]
*  Love amateur sports. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4879.54s)]
*  We love amateur football. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4880.74s)]
*  We love amateur basketball right now. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4882.82s)]
*  Crazy money now. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4885.06s)]
*  So are they even amateur? [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4885.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4887.14s)]
*  So they're just shittier pros. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4887.46s)]
*  We love shittier pros. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4889.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4890.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4891.38s)]
*  Like I don't have enough time to watch every NBA game that I want to watch, but I make sure [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4891.62s)]
*  I make time to watch shittier pros. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4895.3s)]
*  Most of them. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4897.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4898.34s)]
*  Watch guys who will probably never make it to the NBA. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4898.58s)]
*  Never make it. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4900.42s)]
*  And if they do, there'll be huge disappointment. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4901.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4902.74s)]
*  There's maybe one or two guys that will have a career in this entire draft. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4903.38s)]
*  So, yeah, but you know, it's March Madness. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4907.22s)]
*  Doesn't feel very mad, right? [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4911.7s)]
*  Does it feel like so mad? [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4913.78s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4914.58s)]
*  Are they getting crazy upsets yet? [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4914.74s)]
*  Yeah, probably. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4916.42s)]
*  St. John's is the only one. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4917.14s)]
*  That team lost to that team or whatever. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4918.34s)]
*  Oh, I heard about that. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4920.02s)]
*  Yeah, I heard about that. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4920.74s)]
*  And then everybody, and then all the adults pretended like they cared. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4921.86s)]
*  Do you remember? [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4925.38s)]
*  They all have, my bracket is busted. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4925.78s)]
*  My bracket is so busted. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4929.22s)]
*  No sport has had as much done for it by March Madness with brackets. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4931.06s)]
*  Like it's saved. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4934.580000000001s)]
*  This is the only reason anybody gives a fuck [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4935.860000000001s)]
*  because their office is going to give you free lunch if you win. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4937.700000000001s)]
*  This is. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4940.580000000001s)]
*  And that's why you can't. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4940.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, you're all working at Lumen. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4942.34s)]
*  I think this was fantasy sports before fantasy. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4945.3s)]
*  In that, like, remember, I don't know, [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4948.660000000001s)]
*  obviously everybody gambled on whatever the fuck they wanted to gamble back in the day. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4950.900000000001s)]
*  But like you rooted for your team. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4954.02s)]
*  When we were growing up, I rooted for the Knicks. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4956.02s)]
*  I rooted for the Giants or the Jets, whoever was fun. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4958.1s)]
*  I root for the Yankees. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4961.86s)]
*  And then fantasy comes around, you start rooting for like individual players [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4963.7s)]
*  because it reflects on your team. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4966.419999999999s)]
*  And I think that the bracket was the closest that we came to that. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4968.0199999999995s)]
*  Most of us did not go to the colleges that are playing in the tournament. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4971.139999999999s)]
*  My school, I think we made it the year before I went there. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4974.98s)]
*  I don't even know if we've made it since. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4977.299999999999s)]
*  So you end up having this like almost fantasy-esque relationship with the bracket. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4979.54s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4984.419999999999s)]
*  So we pretend that we care about amateur athletics, which we do not. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4985.219999999999s)]
*  New York people also have a weird relationship with college sports. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4988.099999999999s)]
*  In general, which I don't get because so many New Yorkers will go to state schools [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4990.66s)]
*  and then they'll should have some patriotism. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4993.7s)]
*  Because there's no good state school like at athletics in New York. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4995.86s)]
*  But if you go to Ole Miss from New York, I understand what you're saying. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=4999.22s)]
*  A lot of New Yorkers end up going to Michigan or Wisconsin if they can't get into high school. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5002.099999999999s)]
*  And they'll still be like, yeah. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5005.22s)]
*  So like if there's a New Yorker that's at Michigan or Wisconsin, [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5007.3s)]
*  I just want you all to know that that was his last choice. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5010.26s)]
*  They thought they were better than that. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5015.139999999999s)]
*  They applied to Cornell. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5016.82s)]
*  They applied to Brown. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5018.099999999999s)]
*  They probably didn't think they were smart enough to get into Harvard or Princeton, [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5019.22s)]
*  but they applied to the lower IVs. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5021.780000000001s)]
*  They didn't get in. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5023.38s)]
*  And they're like, my safety school will be, [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5024.42s)]
*  I will make the pilgrimage with the rest of the New York Jews to Wisconsin or Michigan. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5026.9800000000005s)]
*  They have a good business school. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5031.780000000001s)]
*  They have a good business school. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5032.66s)]
*  That's what it is. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5033.9400000000005s)]
*  Anyway, and then they pretend to like the college amateur athletics. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5035.62s)]
*  And ironically, NYU is a bunch of kids who wanted to get into IVs and couldn't. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5040.18s)]
*  So they're at NYU. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5042.900000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5043.780000000001s)]
*  They're at NYU. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5044.1s)]
*  But it's actually a good school. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5044.740000000001s)]
*  That's the difference. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5046.18s)]
*  Whereas Michigan and Wisconsin. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5046.9800000000005s)]
*  They just hated their parents. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5048.74s)]
*  Michigan's good. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5049.78s)]
*  Wisconsin. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5050.0199999999995s)]
*  I said they hated their parents. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5050.58s)]
*  They just wanted to get away. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5052.9s)]
*  They just said, how do we get away? [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5053.62s)]
*  Why go to an even colder place? [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5055.139999999999s)]
*  You did it well. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5056.74s)]
*  Go to Santa Barbara. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5057.94s)]
*  The polar opposite weather-wise. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5059.0599999999995s)]
*  Michigan, let's go to a shittier weather state. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5060.98s)]
*  No winter, no classes. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5062.5s)]
*  Like perfect. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5064.179999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5064.9s)]
*  That's what you want in a college experience. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5065.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5067.0599999999995s)]
*  Good Mexican food, finally. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5068.66s)]
*  Do you guys remember a single thing you learned in college? [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5070.5s)]
*  Maybe one or two. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5075.3s)]
*  I don't remember one. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5076.34s)]
*  I thought about this the other day. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5077.780000000001s)]
*  I don't remember one thing I learned in college. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5078.820000000001s)]
*  No, come on. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5082.58s)]
*  I don't remember one. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5083.22s)]
*  I can't remember a single thing. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5084.900000000001s)]
*  You know all of gente Fernandez because of college. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5085.860000000001s)]
*  Not in college. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5089.860000000001s)]
*  Extravirricular. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5091.54s)]
*  Yeah. I would have learned that shit here too. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5092.26s)]
*  You'd think I would have met a Mexican kid here. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5096.34s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5097.860000000001s)]
*  If they had that class though. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5100.820000000001s)]
*  I'm trying to think. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5102.1s)]
*  I think I learned some evolutionary biology stuff. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5102.58s)]
*  That's all I remember. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5104.820000000001s)]
*  Maybe some psych 101. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5106.02s)]
*  But like I don't think you don't learn anything. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5107.22s)]
*  Statistics right now. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5110.900000000001s)]

*  There are certain people that are targeted, [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5185.46s)]
*  meaning they come from very wealthy families. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5190.58s)]
*  Their families might have billions of dollars. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5193.46s)]
*  Marriage has been almost like a tool to protect those assets [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5198.179999999999s)]
*  for hundreds of years maybe in some of these families. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5201.94s)]
*  Well, that's what marriage originally was designed culturally [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5204.82s)]
*  for the purposes of maintaining land ownership and emerging plans. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5208.34s)]
*  I kind of want to, actually, after we get into this discussion, [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5211.94s)]
*  I'd really like to know some of the history of marriage. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5215.46s)]
*  Why, one, why it's continued to be around. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5218.34s)]
*  If this is something that didn't have societal utility, I think that we- [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5220.9s)]
*  Who were the first people that were like, [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5223.54s)]
*  this is going so great, we should get the government involved. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5225.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5227.38s)]
*  You know, that's fucking weird. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5227.62s)]
*  It does seem weird that- that's an interesting thing. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5228.9s)]
*  Even when my wife and I were getting married, [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5231.0599999999995s)]
*  I was like, I really don't care that the government knows about this. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5232.179999999999s)]
*  It's important to me that you and I know about this. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5235.7s)]
*  And we are committing to one another. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5238.82s)]
*  And I think for them, I think that the idea that the government knows about it [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5241.22s)]
*  makes it feel more real because of societal expectations or whatever it is. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5245.78s)]
*  But you know, what's an interesting thing I've always found fascinating is [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5248.82s)]
*  if you said to me, you know, Jim, I'm thinking about buying an airplane. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5255.62s)]
*  If I said, oh, really, why? [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5260.58s)]
*  That's not a rude question. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5262.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5264.259999999999s)]
*  You would say, oh, you know, I fly a lot and it'd be nice. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5264.58s)]
*  I want to learn how to do it. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5267.3s)]
*  OK. If you're dating a girl for a certain period of time, [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5268.179999999999s)]
*  you say to me, you know, Jim, I'm thinking about getting married. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5272.42s)]
*  And I go, why? [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5274.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5275.7s)]
*  That's rude. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5276.1s)]
*  Why is that rude? [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5277.78s)]
*  This is a technology that fails 56 percent of the fucking time. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5280.66s)]
*  And let's say there's another 10, 20 percent that stay together for the kids [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5285.14s)]
*  because they don't want to give away half their shit. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5288.02s)]
*  Why is it rude to say to someone, you guys are getting along, [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5289.94s)]
*  you're in love, you're having fun. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5294.18s)]
*  Why do you want to get the government involved? [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5296.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5298.66s)]
*  Like, why? [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5299.14s)]
*  What my whole thing is, what is the problem [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5299.94s)]
*  to which marriage is a solution? [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5304.18s)]
*  Like, what is the problem to which marriage is like anything else in your life? [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5307.3s)]
*  You can answer that. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5310.66s)]
*  What is the problem to which this is a solution? [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5311.62s)]
*  It's hard to hold water in my hand. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5313.780000000001s)]
*  So we need a container for it. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5315.54s)]
*  What is the problem to which this is a solution? [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5316.9800000000005s)]
*  It's nice to be able to talk to people when they're not in the room. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5318.820000000001s)]
*  OK. What is the problem to which marriage is a solution? [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5320.820000000001s)]
*  I'm lonely? [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5323.54s)]
*  No, marriage doesn't solve that problem. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5324.820000000001s)]
*  I think for women, it's security. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5326.42s)]
*  To answer your question, I thought you brought up a really great point [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5327.38s)]
*  when it came to allocating time with the kids and a divorce, [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5331.54s)]
*  which was like, if a dad has every other weekend, [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5336.02s)]
*  it's kind of looked at like, oh, yeah, OK, he's got a job. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5338.42s)]
*  He's a divorced dad. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5340.9s)]
*  If a mom has ever other weekends, she's looking at it like a psychopath. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5341.94s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5344.82s)]
*  So I do think that women that are in long term relationships but aren't married, [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5345.3s)]
*  feel a societal scrutiny. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5350.1s)]
*  Sure. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5351.7s)]
*  Will he not commit to me? [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5352.1s)]
*  Does he not really love you? [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5353.54s)]
*  Is he trying to protect his money or his assets or something like that? [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5355.14s)]
*  I think a lot of times that informs their decision to, quote unquote, [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5358.82s)]
*  get the government involved. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5361.7s)]
*  It's less about the government. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5362.98s)]
*  It's more about how will society view me as this person's partner? [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5364.26s)]
*  And is it a lack of commitment? [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5368.82s)]
*  Which obviously now, if we remove the emotion from it, [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5370.42s)]
*  we can unpack and go, yeah, it doesn't change anything in that relationship. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5373.54s)]
*  But you can literally not get married, [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5377.54s)]
*  but you can sign a contract with some lawyers about how assets can be distributed. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5380.099999999999s)]
*  You can have the government play no part. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5384.98s)]
*  And if you, by the way, don't even know what role the government plays in that, [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5387.06s)]
*  it's kind of a fiction. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5390.26s)]
*  And by the way, you trust that Mark is married. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5391.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5394.660000000001s)]
*  Have you checked the fucking paperwork ever? [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5395.14s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5396.580000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5397.06s)]
*  No, no. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5397.620000000001s)]
*  Honestly, have you ever gone to a wedding and after, at the end, [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5398.1s)]
*  gone, lovely ceremony, great pigs in the blanket at the cocktail alley. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5402.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5406.02s)]
*  See the paperwork? [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5406.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5407.22s)]
*  I'm sorry, you don't have the marriage license. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5407.860000000001s)]
*  I just want to make sure. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5409.38s)]
*  Your parents might not be fucking married. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5410.34s)]
*  But you know what? [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5412.02s)]
*  Did you check the paperwork? [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5412.5s)]
*  I've never looked. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5413.46s)]
*  We know about the nurse outfit. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5413.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5415.22s)]
*  You don't know about the paperwork. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5415.7s)]
*  They're so low. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5416.98s)]
*  You're speaking logically. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5417.7s)]
*  By the way, have as many fucking weddings as you want, guys. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5418.74s)]
*  Getting married's lots of fun. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5421.94s)]
*  It's a great party. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5423.54s)]
*  I'm all for it. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5424.58s)]
*  I fucking love weddings, so I like pigs in blankets. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5425.139999999999s)]
*  But the truth is, does that mean you actually have to go sign a marriage license [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5427.7s)]
*  and get the government involved? [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5431.94s)]
*  It's not necessarily. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5432.82s)]
*  But let's real quick, let's just divide this up. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5433.62s)]
*  What you're not saying, you're not saying that having a partner [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5436.82s)]
*  that you guys dedicate your lives to each other and grow a family with is bad. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5439.94s)]
*  Not only is it not bad, I think it's the- [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5443.86s)]
*  Best thing in the world. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5445.62s)]
*  It's incredibly important that we all need to do it. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5446.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's the best pair of bonds. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5447.94s)]
*  Relationships, love, what is better than love? [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5450.099999999999s)]
*  Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5453.38s)]
*  I guess what happens is I think when people hear the word, [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5454.42s)]
*  why would you get married, they often assume that you're like, [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5457.38s)]
*  have a few girlfriends or don't commit to one person or it's not going to work out. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5460.42s)]
*  You're pro-relationship. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5464.5s)]
*  I'm pro-monogamy. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5466.099999999999s)]
*  You're pro-monogamy, pro-family. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5468.34s)]
*  I'm pro-people building families together. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5470.0199999999995s)]
*  There's a reason why throughout the history of humankind, pair bonds, monogamy, [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5472.9800000000005s)]
*  this exists for biological reasons, it exists for social reasons. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5478.900000000001s)]
*  If I saw a correlation between love and marriage and love being sustained [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5484.42s)]
*  by the fact that you've married, I would be the biggest fan of marriage in the world. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5492.900000000001s)]
*  What I see is the opposite. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5497.9400000000005s)]
*  What I see is people dating and in love who then sign on for a contract [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5500.18s)]
*  that they do not understand at all and then I think it becomes almost antagonistic to it [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5505.54s)]
*  because our society considers it so acceptable. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5512.58s)]
*  Come on, listen, look at every group of women you've ever seen out who are married. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5516.34s)]
*  One of them is not married. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5522.82s)]
*  The one who's not married is talking about a guy who she just started dating and they all are, [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5525.38s)]
*  oh my God, he sounds so great, he's so wonderful, it's so great, oh my God, [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5530.42s)]
*  he did that, he's so lovely. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5533.86s)]
*  And then when they talk about their husbands, oh, yeah, she's such a, I mean, you know, [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5535.94s)]
*  and then he comes home and all that is, is the guy that she's talking about [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5539.78s)]
*  a couple of years down the road. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5546.9s)]
*  Like marriage becomes very antagonistic to this situation, [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5549.22s)]
*  says the guy who's been married how many years now? [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5554.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5556.18s)]
*  Like, okay, the reality is, like, listen, I'm telling you, [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5556.82s)]
*  the previews is always the best part of the movie. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5560.74s)]
*  No, no, no, what I'm trying to say is, specifically, one, like, [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5562.98s)]
*  when everybody knows that you're married, it's no, like, you'd have to be a psychopath [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5568.42s)]
*  to walk into a room of your friends and be like, my wife and I did the most amazing thing [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5573.3s)]
*  and she's the kindest person. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5577.86s)]
*  That's not what we want to hear about. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5579.38s)]
*  We want to hear, like you said, like, as a divorce attorney, you walk into a party, [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5580.74s)]
*  you're like, tell me the drama, tell me the craziest thing. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5584.099999999999s)]
*  So I'm coming in with the funny shit, which is the drama. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5586.179999999999s)]
*  When you're dating a new person, there's no drama yet. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5588.58s)]
*  It's like, we went on one date, he beat me. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5590.82s)]
*  That never happens. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5592.42s)]
*  So it's just like, oh, what's the sex? [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5593.219999999999s)]
*  What's it like? [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5595.219999999999s)]
*  Is he good? [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5596.0199999999995s)]
*  It's bubble. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5596.82s)]
*  And we miss that euphoria, not that the love fades, [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5597.86s)]
*  but it shifts from euphoria to a different love. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5600.66s)]
*  And by the way, what it shifts to can also be way better than that euphoria. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5602.98s)]
*  I think my relationship with my wife has gotten better since. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5606.26s)]
*  I think most, there are a lot of people that will tell you that. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5608.34s)]
*  And by the way, at its best, that's what happens in a relationship, [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5610.820000000001s)]
*  is you give up novelty in exchange for a depth of connection, [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5614.34s)]
*  a person who understands you, a person who, look, this all makes sense to me. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5618.9800000000005s)]
*  Again, the question I have is how does the government get involved in that [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5623.38s)]
*  and does the institution of marriage add value to it? [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5627.62s)]
*  Like, I genuinely believe what you are saying about how you feel about your wife. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5631.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5635.3s)]
*  If you had not married her and you hadn't signed that contract, [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5636.0199999999995s)]
*  you would still feel that way. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5640.98s)]
*  What I could say in your favor is that maybe society, law hasn't caught up to society. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5643.0599999999995s)]
*  Society has gotten more egalitarian gender roles wise, equality wise for men and women. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5648.42s)]
*  But especially 30, 40, 50 years ago, there wasn't that. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5653.62s)]
*  So women needed that security. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5657.3s)]
*  And I think that's still left over. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5659.22s)]
*  I don't think marriage has no place, but I definitely understand women's need [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5661.62s)]
*  for it more than men because they're still coming from, this equality thing is relatively recent. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5664.58s)]
*  My attitude about tradition, because really marriage is a tradition. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5669.14s)]
*  It's a societal tradition. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5672.66s)]
*  And there's really two ways to look at tradition. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5674.5s)]
*  And I think they're both valid. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5677.22s)]
*  Okay. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5678.58s)]
*  One is a tradition is something that worked in the past because there's reasons for it. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5679.46s)]
*  And maybe the people before us knew some things that we haven't figured out yet [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5684.74s)]
*  because we're younger than them in the scheme of things. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5689.14s)]
*  The other way you can look at tradition is peer pressure exerted by dead people. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5692.1s)]
*  That's really what tradition very often is, is it's peer pressure from dead people. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5697.54s)]
*  Why are we doing it this way? [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5701.9400000000005s)]
*  Because my great grandmother did it that way. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5702.9800000000005s)]
*  Your great grandmother didn't have a smartphone. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5704.66s)]
*  Your great grandmother did a whole bunch of things differently. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5707.46s)]
*  Some of which, by the way, make as much if not more sense now, [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5710.82s)]
*  but some of which make no sense anymore. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5713.86s)]
*  And how have we evolved as a culture to the point where if you said, [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5716.42s)]
*  my wife is my property, she was her father's property. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5720.1s)]
*  And then he handed her to me in exchange for me giving something to her. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5724.18s)]
*  And now I own her. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5728.58s)]
*  Sounds pretty fire. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5730.58s)]
*  It sounds fun. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5731.38s)]
*  Sounds pretty fire. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5732.58s)]
*  Some people would have an issue with it. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5734.02s)]
*  Okay. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5735.700000000001s)]
*  Yet, what is a wedding ceremony? [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5736.5s)]
*  Most wedding ceremonies is the gives away the bride. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5740.02s)]
*  It's symbolic of things that most women would find terribly offensive. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5742.900000000001s)]
*  But because we put all these cultural things around it, it's like, oh, yes, [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5747.38s)]
*  buying a woman an engagement ring. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5751.22s)]
*  Like how many women have you met that are so feminist that they go, [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5753.38s)]
*  I'm not accepting you giving me some expensive thing as a way of purchasing. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5756.42s)]
*  Is it there? [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5760.5s)]
*  Fuck that. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5760.9800000000005s)]
*  You could be a Bella Abzug feminist and you would still be like, oh, yeah, no, [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5762.26s)]
*  I want a big fucking rock and it better not be lab made. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5766.18s)]
*  That's how it works. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5769.62s)]
*  I mean, I like Christmas presents. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5770.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5772.74s)]
*  It's the same shit. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5773.22s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5773.9400000000005s)]
*  But we like nice things, right? [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5775.78s)]
*  And there's no problem with that. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5777.38s)]
*  Of course. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5778.5s)]
*  But I don't then create a whole fiction as to why this is good for society. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5779.46s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5784.34s)]
*  I think what we agree on is two people coming together to share love and then [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5784.9s)]
*  potentially raising a family together and not leaving each other to go fuck other people [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5790.58s)]
*  and create other families at the same time. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5796.66s)]
*  I think kids are the biggest thing. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5798.099999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5799.38s)]
*  It is really good and beneficial for society. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5799.86s)]
*  I think we can all agree on that. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5802.66s)]
*  And let's just use the term marriage for that. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5803.86s)]
*  OK. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5806.82s)]
*  If, for example, every marriage required a prenup, meaning you couldn't get married [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5808.82s)]
*  unless you had agreed on the terms of that marriage. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5816.339999999999s)]
*  Now we've removed the government doing the prenup, which it seems to me is your biggest concern. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5820.42s)]
*  You love love. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5826.5s)]
*  You love people coming together. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5827.46s)]
*  You love them creating families. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5828.74s)]
*  And it's really important for society. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5829.86s)]
*  What you don't love are these rules imposed on us that might be antiquated [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5831.78s)]
*  or not favorable for either party. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5835.62s)]
*  Well said. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5837.139999999999s)]
*  You're a marriage libertarian. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5837.78s)]
*  Exactly correct. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5839.86s)]
*  So what you want to do is, so I think what you're telling me, [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5840.74s)]
*  just because I don't want it to seem like you're anti-marriage, [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5844.9s)]
*  you're anti- no, sorry, you're pro what we assume marriage is, which is this union, [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5847.54s)]
*  without this antiquated gunk that is then imposed on us if it doesn't go well. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5851.7s)]
*  If it doesn't go well. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5856.9s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5857.62s)]
*  My attitude is, by the way, and if you want to buy into any of the antiquated gunk, [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5857.94s)]
*  you have every right to. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5862.259999999999s)]
*  And you put it in your prenup. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5863.219999999999s)]
*  And this person who you've picked out of eight billion other options, [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5865.299999999999s)]
*  you're saying this is my person. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5869.86s)]
*  Who is more qualified than the two of you to agree on the rules? [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5873.139999999999s)]
*  I think reframing things, and I'm sure you've done this in every single meeting, [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5877.62s)]
*  I'm more talking to the audience, but I think us reframing marriage in that way [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5880.5s)]
*  and having a real cool understanding and fair conversation about what would make us both [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5885.78s)]
*  comfortable in this. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5891.86s)]
*  And then you learn a lot about each other. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5893.3s)]
*  By the way, and that's the point. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5894.66s)]
*  And that's- [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5896.26s)]
*  To me, that is the point, because that's a conversation worth having. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5896.58s)]
*  Even if you don't end up doing a prenup, having a conversation about, [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5901.78s)]
*  hey, what do we owe each other? [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5905.46s)]
*  What does this mean to you? [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5907.7s)]
*  What do you expect of me? [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5909.62s)]
*  Because I want to meet your expectations. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5911.139999999999s)]
*  What do you want from me? [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5913.62s)]
*  And then you learn a lot about each other through that process, [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5914.82s)]
*  because if some guy is marrying a girl, then they have to do this prenup process, [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5917.86s)]
*  because that's part of the marriage. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5922.099999999999s)]
*  The government basically says this, hey, our rules are kind of fucked up. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5923.54s)]
*  We're going to give you a baseline. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5927.38s)]
*  Use some, don't use some, but we recommend you go get an attorney. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5929.0599999999995s)]
*  And maybe there's even a public office where they can do it. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5932.82s)]
*  I don't know if that's- [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5934.9s)]
*  It doesn't even have to be that complicated. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5935.38s)]
*  But yeah, so you go do it. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5936.82s)]
*  And then you can learn a lot. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5939.62s)]
*  If the guy goes, by the way, in this prenup, [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5940.82s)]
*  I want to make sure that you don't deviate within 10 pounds of your weight right now. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5942.98s)]
*  You'll learn what's really important to that guy. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5946.5s)]
*  And then you might go- [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5948.339999999999s)]
*  Don't you want to know that before you marry this fucking guy? [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5949.0599999999995s)]
*  And then you might go, I don't want to get married to this guy. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5951.86s)]
*  Or before she says to you, well, you know, if you earn less than X number of dollars- [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5954.339999999999s)]
*  I don't want to be with you. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5958.66s)]
*  Well, I'd like to have that conversation before we've signed up for that contract. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5959.7s)]
*  I think that's a very fair way of approaching it. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5963.94s)]
*  But I like this idea that you're not against the union. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5965.86s)]
*  And I think a lot of times when there's criticism of marriage, [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5969.54s)]
*  people think it's criticism of two people starting a family and loving each other. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5972.1s)]
*  That's not it. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5975.9400000000005s)]
*  We need that for society. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5976.42s)]
*  And staying together. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5977.46s)]
*  That's a good tradition. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5978.02s)]
*  Saying I do isn't saying I can. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5978.820000000001s)]
*  It's saying I'll try. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5984.1s)]
*  Right. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5985.780000000001s)]
*  At best. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5986.02s)]
*  Right. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5986.740000000001s)]
*  At best. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5987.06s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5988.02s)]
*  You know, like at best, what you say when you say I do is you're saying, [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5988.5s)]
*  I'm making you a promise. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5992.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5993.38s)]
*  And if you're not fucking three, you know people break promises, right? [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5994.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5997.700000000001s)]
*  So really what you're saying when you make a promise is I'm going to really try- [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=5997.9400000000005s)]
*  I'm going to try my best. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6001.22s)]
*  I'm going to try my best. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6002.02s)]
*  I'm going to try my best to love you. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6003.3s)]
*  I'm going to try my best to take everything that you bring to this relationship and see it in good faith. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6005.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6011.54s)]
*  And I'm not going to attribute negative intentions. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6012.02s)]
*  I'm going to cheer for you. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6014.26s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6015.62s)]
*  And you're going to cheer for me. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6016.02s)]
*  And I'm going to see your blind spots. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6017.62s)]
*  And when I have to call you out, I'm going to do it with love. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6018.9800000000005s)]
*  And I'm going to try to say to you, babe, I think this is going to hurt you long term, [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6020.9800000000005s)]
*  what you're doing right now. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6023.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6024.740000000001s)]
*  Like what is more beautiful than that? [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6024.9800000000005s)]
*  No, it's awesome. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6026.740000000001s)]
*  Who would disagree with that? [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6027.22s)]
*  It's awesome. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6028.1s)]
*  But again, like why not call those terms out in advance and have that conversation? [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6028.58s)]
*  I think this is a super healthy way of looking at marriage. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6032.66s)]
*  And if you're telling me right now that the legislation has already changed to adjust some [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6036.18s)]
*  of the antiquated ideas that were there to obviously protect women but now are no longer needed, [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6040.82s)]
*  what you're basically saying is the government is going, hey, we got to update the prenup. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6045.62s)]
*  If the government has a prenup, they're basically going, marriages deserve prenups. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6049.62s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6053.3s)]
*  And the government, by the way, is changing it. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6053.78s)]
*  They're changing it the way the government changes things, [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6056.1s)]
*  which is way late in the game. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6057.94s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6059.7s)]
*  So it's like they don't catch up. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6060.419999999999s)]
*  There's a reason why the IRS's lawyers and the tax lawyers that get paid millions of dollars, [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6062.66s)]
*  the tax lawyers that get paid millions of dollars are always four steps ahead of these fucking guys. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6068.5s)]
*  And they're reacting. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6072.0199999999995s)]
*  The top of the class goes to work for these firms. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6072.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6075.139999999999s)]
*  Why? [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6075.299999999999s)]
*  Because they have every incentive to do that. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6075.94s)]
*  So for me, saying, you know what, I trust the government so much that I know they'll [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6078.179999999999s)]
*  change the law to protect me. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6084.339999999999s)]
*  That's the most naive thing I've ever heard of them being said. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6085.94s)]
*  And even if you want to look at the government acting in good faith, they're like, hey, [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6088.66s)]
*  there are these people who go, hey, we got a problem. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6092.82s)]
*  There are these divorced women. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6094.419999999999s)]
*  They're fucking homeless right now. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6095.78s)]
*  Or they're going back to living with their parents. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6097.139999999999s)]
*  They're starving to eat. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6099.219999999999s)]
*  They can't even take care of their kids. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6100.419999999999s)]
*  Now they're not around their kids. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6101.78s)]
*  We got to do something to protect that. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6103.0599999999995s)]
*  They overcorrect. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6104.74s)]
*  And this is the mistake. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6105.94s)]
*  People come into this and they think prenups were designed for wealthy people only. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6107.139999999999s)]
*  Right? [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6112.0199999999995s)]
*  And by the way, there's a reason why. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6112.339999999999s)]
*  Because look, there's times where a person comes to the marriage, they have a tremendous [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6114.02s)]
*  amount of assets. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6117.38s)]
*  I want to talk about that. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6117.9400000000005s)]
*  And they say, look, I've got a ton of money. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6118.820000000001s)]
*  In an alternate universe, you are you now at your level of success. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6121.620000000001s)]
*  And you meet a lovely young woman and you say, you know what, let's get it. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6126.740000000001s)]
*  Let's do this thing. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6129.620000000001s)]
*  If you get divorced in three months, you should get half of everything. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6131.9400000000005s)]
*  That's fucking crazy. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6134.42s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6135.540000000001s)]
*  And I think even the government would say that that's not how it works. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6136.34s)]
*  That isn't how it works. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6139.22s)]
*  But maybe there was a time where it was. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6140.5s)]
*  Well, and there's still very complicated things, which is how guys like me make a lot of money. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6142.42s)]
*  Because what happens is we have what's called transmutation, which is if you had a separate [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6146.34s)]
*  property asset, meaning something you own before the marriage, and then you get married [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6150.18s)]
*  and you mix an asset that you earn during the marriage or income earned during the marriage [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6154.26s)]
*  with your premarital money, you turn that separate into marital. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6159.14s)]
*  So we have what's called the marital presumption, which is basically so like, think of it. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6164.74s)]
*  I always tell clients, think about it like, you know, your separate property, [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6169.14s)]
*  premarital money is like a bowl of water and marital money is like a drop of red dye. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6173.9400000000005s)]
*  You drop that in, you can't take it back out. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6179.46s)]
*  The whole thing's pink. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6181.620000000001s)]
*  You're doing renovations on it with your marital money. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6182.5s)]
*  Now all of a sudden you're saying the property becomes marital. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6186.820000000001s)]
*  But you could make the argument that by doing those renovations, it increased the value [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6191.780000000001s)]
*  of that property five million. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6196.26s)]
*  100%. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6197.86s)]
*  And you know, I get paid a lot of money per hour to make that argument. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6198.5s)]
*  And then the other lawyer gets paid a bunch of money by the hour to say, no, no, no, [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6201.46s)]
*  there was no donative intent. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6204.82s)]
*  There was no consideration. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6205.94s)]
*  But the fact that there's so many people. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6207.0599999999995s)]
*  So the reality is, is why are we making money on this? [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6208.0199999999995s)]
*  Why couldn't the two of you in advance just sit down and say, hey, you know what? [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6211.139999999999s)]
*  Let's put aside some, like, let's decide the rule set. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6216.9s)]
*  If we put it in your name, it's this. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6219.38s)]
*  If we put it in joint sets, we'll split it 50-50. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6220.74s)]
*  If we use premarital money, we'll do it this way. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6222.74s)]
*  Have that fucking conversation. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6224.9s)]
*  This is great. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6226.98s)]
*  I love how, like, you obviously are an amazing communicator and you're very spirited about [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6227.86s)]
*  this. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6231.219999999999s)]
*  But like, the spirit to me seems to come from this place of, guys, this could be so much easier. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6231.459999999999s)]
*  And so much better. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6236.9s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6237.7s)]
*  So much better. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6238.419999999999s)]
*  But there is this negative stigma about a prenup because we only think about these people with [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6239.219999999999s)]
*  tons of assets that are doing it to protect it from a gold digger. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6244.259999999999s)]
*  We don't think about people who are building a life, like, in a lot of our circumstances. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6247.299999999999s)]
*  We don't really have that. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6251.379999999999s)]
*  I mean, we're doing OK, but we don't have, like, tons of money. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6252.82s)]
*  And then once we get married, we start building this amazing life. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6254.74s)]
*  And that's probably the majority of people that are getting married. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6259.139999999999s)]
*  The majority of people aren't coming from $300 million. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6262.66s)]
*  And by the way, people that don't have as much are the ones who really have to worry [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6266.179999999999s)]
*  about how do we divide it and protect it. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6269.62s)]
*  Because if you got hundreds of millions of dollars, fucking you. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6271.54s)]
*  Give her $20 million. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6274.099999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6274.42s)]
*  But if you're in a situation where, like most people, you're kind of basically getting by, [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6275.3s)]
*  well, now you're going to have two electric bills and two cable bills and two everything. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6280.34s)]
*  So to me, like, you know, what's so funny is when early in my career. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6283.700000000001s)]
*  I'm sorry to cut you here, but it is really interesting to, like, [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6287.860000000001s)]
*  understand your perspective on this. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6290.9800000000005s)]
*  You're not against the institution. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6292.660000000001s)]
*  You're like, it could be so much more better. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6295.22s)]
*  And you've gone through so many where you're like, we're still bickering over this because [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6298.26s)]
*  you guys didn't make this very easy decision early on. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6301.46s)]
*  And I just don't think it makes it unromantic. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6304.1s)]
*  Like, we all know life ends. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6308.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6310.740000000001s)]
*  How would you? [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6310.900000000001s)]
*  Does that mean life's not like, did you ever go like, well, I'm going to die someday, [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6311.3s)]
*  so I might as well just die now. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6314.900000000001s)]
*  Like, no, like the beauty is going through the press. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6316.58s)]
*  Like you're watching a movie and someone says, oh, the movie's going to end. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6318.740000000001s)]
*  You don't go, well, fuck it. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6321.62s)]
*  I'm not even going to watch it. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6322.42s)]
*  Like, no, the beauty is to watch the movie and know that this is a temporary thing. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6323.3s)]
*  Look, look, every marriage ends. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6327.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6329.7s)]
*  It ends in death or in divorce. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6330.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6332.740000000001s)]
*  Your marriage will end. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6333.38s)]
*  I promise. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6334.5s)]
*  I hope so. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6335.06s)]
*  That's a weird thing to say to a person. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6337.38s)]
*  I hope your marriage ends in death, but I do. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6339.54s)]
*  I hope that's how your marriage ends. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6342.58s)]
*  Because the only two options are just going to end in death or divorce. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6344.0199999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6346.5s)]
*  So you have life insurance. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6347.06s)]
*  No one ever would look at you and go, you're so morbid with that life insurance. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6349.22s)]
*  Like, why would you think you have to do that? [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6353.06s)]
*  I'm protecting these people that I love. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6355.06s)]
*  Like, I know something's good. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6357.14s)]
*  OK, so what is wrong with two people? [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6358.42s)]
*  When I was early in my career, I decided, I thought, you know what? [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6361.22s)]
*  You did these wedding fairs. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6365.14s)]
*  Have you ever seen, I don't know if any of you were forced to do, you chose well. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6366.5s)]
*  If you didn't have to do this, this is good. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6369.3s)]
*  You did well with the women in your lives. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6370.74s)]
*  With where you go see a bunch of vendors or something? [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6372.1s)]
*  Yes. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6373.7s)]
*  My wife did that. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6373.860000000001s)]
*  OK, so she made you go? [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6374.58s)]
*  No. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6377.54s)]
*  She's my big sister. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6377.9400000000005s)]
*  That's fantastic. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6378.9800000000005s)]
*  Listen, this is next for this is not. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6379.860000000001s)]
*  You ever want to see sad men? [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6382.58s)]
*  About that thing. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6385.22s)]
*  They're just like, hold, you know, it's like if you took her to the car show. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6386.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6389.22s)]
*  Like, she's just like, what the fuck are we doing here? [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6389.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6391.54s)]
*  So, but these things, they have photographers, the cake people, the invitation. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6391.860000000001s)]
*  The criminals, all of them. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6396.18s)]
*  The little sweatshirts. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6396.900000000001s)]
*  All of them. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6397.7s)]
*  They're all wedding industrial complex. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6398.26s)]
*  They're all more. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6400.42s)]
*  The whole crew. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6401.139999999999s)]
*  All of them. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6402.099999999999s)]
*  Please, I'm not the scavenger. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6402.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6404.099999999999s)]
*  I don't make the rain. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6404.66s)]
*  I sell the umbrella. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6405.38s)]
*  These fucking people. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6407.94s)]

*  Fuck you, Cinderella Blanche. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6413.86s)]
*  It's like you're actually going to have a wedding and not give away scented candles. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6414.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6418.26s)]
*  I know we had to do that. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6418.9s)]
*  You don't care about your family. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6420.099999999999s)]
*  I guess you don't have to have the scented candles. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6423.78s)]
*  She's like, babe, we need scented candles. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6425.22s)]
*  But I went and I said, hey, listen, can I get a table? [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6427.219999999999s)]
*  Can I have a table? [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6432.5s)]
*  Like you pay like 10 grand. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6433.3s)]
*  Just for prenups. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6436.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6437.219999999999s)]
*  Just for prenups. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6437.7s)]
*  I said, I promise I'll do it very respectfully and say, hey, congratulations on your engagement. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6438.26s)]
*  Let's talk about prenups. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6441.94s)]
*  They wouldn't take my fucking money. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6443.7s)]
*  Wow. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6445.46s)]
*  They wouldn't let me in the door. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6446.099999999999s)]
*  Because, and why? [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6447.86s)]
*  Because there's a fucking fantasy they're selling people and don't let reality get into the fantasy. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6449.0599999999995s)]
*  For me, I think I'm actually a true romantic because I like reality. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6454.74s)]
*  My attitude is I like somebody who looks at the situation and goes, you know what? [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6459.46s)]
*  Whether we win, whether we lose, let's play this fucking game. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6463.78s)]
*  Let's do this thing. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6467.3s)]
*  Let's try. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6468.26s)]
*  Let's shoot for it. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6469.7s)]
*  This is a game we can't win. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6471.38s)]
*  We're either going to die and lose each other or we're going to divorce and lose each other. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6473.14s)]
*  But fuck it. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6477.06s)]
*  I want to take this ride. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6477.860000000001s)]
*  Could you make the argument that going through that prenup process could lengthen the marriage? [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6478.66s)]
*  Well, here's what I'll tell you. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6486.0199999999995s)]
*  I've been doing prenups for 25 years. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6486.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6488.82s)]
*  Okay? [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6489.0599999999995s)]
*  25 years I've been doing prenups and I always end up having a good relationship with the person at [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6490.18s)]
*  the end of the transaction because unlike a divorce, it's not protracted. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6494.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6497.46s)]
*  It's relatively inexpensive. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6497.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6499.0599999999995s)]
*  I've probably only had to do three divorces, four divorces of people I didn't prenup. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6500.18s)]
*  This is interesting to talk about. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6504.18s)]
*  I think it's a self-selecting group. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6505.46s)]
*  What are the percentages? [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6507.38s)]
*  Okay. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6508.74s)]
*  So we know what the percentage of divorces for marriage. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6508.9800000000005s)]
*  What is the percentage of divorce for prenup? [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6511.78s)]
*  You'll never know. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6514.74s)]
*  And here's why. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6515.78s)]
*  The prenup's not filed anywhere. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6516.82s)]
*  Like I have celebrity clients who I did their prenup. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6519.38s)]
*  That'd be really important. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6522.34s)]
*  And they are doing interviews saying, oh, we don't have a prenup. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6523.06s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, you fucking do. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6526.74s)]
*  It's in my safe. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6528.1s)]
*  I wrote it. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6528.9800000000005s)]
*  But they tell people because why? [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6529.9400000000005s)]
*  It's one of those things. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6531.7s)]
*  Everything I do, so here's the cake. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6533.54s)]
*  Oh, here's this ticket out flower. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6535.06s)]
*  No one's ever like, here's the signing the prenup because everybody goes, [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6536.42s)]
*  they got a prenup. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6539.46s)]
*  Oh, all right. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6540.34s)]
*  It's all social stigma. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6542.9s)]
*  And there's no reason for we have to normalize prenups. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6544.42s)]
*  We have to democratize prenups. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6549.54s)]
*  By the way, prenups are so unbelievably easy for attorneys to draft. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6552.26s)]
*  No one is making a bunch of money on prenups. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6560.1s)]
*  We make our money on litigation. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6563.3s)]
*  We make money on the way out. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6564.82s)]
*  Not on the way in. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6566.26s)]
*  So the truth is, there is no reason why it has to be reserved for the wealthy. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6567.54s)]
*  This is something that can be democratized. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6572.1s)]
*  There can be an access to justice. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6573.9400000000005s)]
*  People could go even with AI technology that's out there now. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6575.54s)]
*  Listen, I've been involved in a startup called Trusted Prenup. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6579.780000000001s)]
*  And our thing is going to be we are going to democratize prenups. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6584.1s)]
*  It's coming soon because AI has made it possible now for there to be a tree menu [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6587.22s)]
*  where people go in and go, OK, what do we want to do with Alamo? [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6592.42s)]
*  What do we want to do when it comes to our estates? [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6595.219999999999s)]
*  What do we want to do? [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6596.82s)]
*  And you can just pick and put it together, spit that document out. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6597.86s)]
*  And by the way, it's not filed anywhere. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6601.7s)]
*  You don't have to tell anybody that you did it. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6603.0599999999995s)]
*  It can just be a discussion between you and this partner [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6604.9s)]
*  that you tell the most intimate things to. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6607.62s)]
*  You have the most intimate experiences with. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6609.86s)]
*  Why can't you have honest conversations about that? [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6611.54s)]
*  So hearing that, are the three of you guys going to get post notes? [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6614.419999999999s)]
*  No, for sure not. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6616.82s)]
*  It's going to be really bad for us. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6618.179999999999s)]
*  I'm going to have them watch this episode. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6620.5s)]
*  They're not going to get one. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6621.78s)]
*  They're going to get one. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6623.38s)]
*  And he's going to show it to every girl. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6624.5s)]
*  Baby, once you watched this, is that last week? [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6627.7s)]
*  We had different haircuts. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6631.7s)]
*  You're like, no, that was a rerun. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6633.22s)]
*  But it was a good one. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6635.46s)]
*  Our wives are going to watch this episode. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6636.5s)]
*  He said something about Abraham Lincoln, very racist. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6637.62s)]
*  The whole issue. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6641.860000000001s)]
*  We had to cuss because we got him through hands. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6642.66s)]
*  No, I think our wives are going to watch this episode for sure. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6646.74s)]
*  I'm curious their perspective on it. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6649.06s)]
*  But I can't. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6650.66s)]
*  I texted Mark this morning. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6651.14s)]
*  And I said, you got to tell your wife that you're spending the day with a divorce lawyer. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6652.740000000001s)]
*  You'll definitely get some. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6655.9400000000005s)]
*  I brought that up three days ago. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6657.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6659.22s)]
*  I was like, by the way, we're going to have this divorce attorney with Mark. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6659.700000000001s)]
*  My wife was definitely like, why are you having him on? [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6662.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6664.660000000001s)]
*  Your wives have never met me and all hate me. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6666.58s)]
*  But hopefully by the end of this episode, they're like, you know, he's kind of a romantic. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6668.820000000001s)]
*  That's not so bad. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6672.1s)]
*  You are pro-marriage. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6673.06s)]
*  You're just anti-marriage without a prenup. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6674.02s)]
*  What I'll say is, I think it's irresponsible to marry without a prenup. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6676.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm not again listening. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6680.1s)]
*  People want to do dumb shit. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6681.3s)]
*  You want to do some dumb shit, do some dumb shit. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6685.3s)]
*  Just admit you're doing some dumb shit. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6687.38s)]
*  Like, I'm just a fan of reality. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6689.3s)]
*  I'm an Indian kid who's a stand-up comic. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6691.860000000001s)]
*  You think I'm new to dumb shit? [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6693.620000000001s)]
*  That might be your brand. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6696.58s)]
*  But all I'm saying is at least own it. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6698.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's new weird. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6703.06s)]
*  Fuck it. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6704.02s)]
*  Because marriage is like, you're probably not going to win. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6704.5s)]
*  But if you win, it's so fucking good. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6708.26s)]
*  Bye. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6710.98s)]
*  So whatever, man. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6711.22s)]
*  Do it. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6712.58s)]
*  But I'm just the kind of guy who likes to go into the casino and go, yeah, I'll bet money. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6712.98s)]
*  How much? [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6720.26s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6720.82s)]
*  Whatever you guys decide. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6721.22s)]
*  Like, that's fucking crazy. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6722.34s)]
*  No, it is high risk, high reward. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6723.54s)]
*  And I think anybody who believes differently is it's crazy. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6724.74s)]
*  It is high risk, high reward. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6727.94s)]
*  I just think if you play and you do. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6729.14s)]
*  And one thing you brought up a car analogy. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6730.9s)]
*  One thing I laugh at is people who are like, you know, you get a car, you get an oil change [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6732.5s)]
*  every 3000 miles each, a transmission, you get all the constant maintenance. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6736.26s)]
*  Marriage, people are like, no, you don't need to go to counseling. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6739.860000000001s)]
*  You do it one time. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6741.860000000001s)]
*  Well, what's even more amazing about marriage, if you want to take the car analogy a little bit [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6743.38s)]
*  further, like, all right, so you get married in your 20s or your 30s, right? [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6746.820000000001s)]
*  All right. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6750.66s)]
*  When you're 20 years old, if I said to you, you can have any car in the world, what car do you want? [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6750.900000000001s)]
*  You'd be like Ferrari, Lamborghini, whatever, Aston Martin, anything. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6754.74s)]
*  It might be a muscle car. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6757.9400000000005s)]
*  OK. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6758.900000000001s)]
*  And then after you bought it, I saw, by the way, it's the only car you're ever going to have [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6760.74s)]
*  your whole fucking life. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6763.860000000001s)]
*  You'd be like, wait, what? [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6764.82s)]
*  Because I don't want to be 80 getting out of a Ferrari. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6766.34s)]
*  Like, I'm going to if I have kids, where am I going to put the car seat? [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6768.74s)]
*  Marriage is you are choosing this person. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6772.259999999999s)]
*  And theoretically, you are saying in your 20s or 30s, you are saying this person for the rest of my life. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6774.74s)]
*  Now, again, at best, it's like those trees that grow next to each other and then become entwined. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6781.299999999999s)]
*  And it's like they grow together and they become something different, but they become something [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6786.42s)]
*  different together. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6791.7s)]
*  So like, that's amazing when it's done the right way. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6792.74s)]
*  But to suggest that like, oh, it'll never change. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6795.38s)]
*  We're always going to be like we were when we fell in love. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6798.66s)]
*  That's foolish. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6800.74s)]
*  Jim, Jim, you need to you need to switch the name. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6801.78s)]
*  So it's called I don't know why Al's been laughing at me. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6807.54s)]
*  I literally know I got lost when Al Kosh was like, I'm I don't know what he was saying. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6813.139999999999s)]
*  Something. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6817.46s)]
*  I was like, what's going on? [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6817.86s)]
*  He's a car. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6818.66s)]
*  He's a car. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6819.139999999999s)]
*  But Al's been laughing at me. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6820.18s)]
*  And then I started going like, am I making a weird face? [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6821.78s)]
*  Does it look like I'm regretting my marriage? [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6823.78s)]
*  Like, I got really self-conscious. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6825.54s)]
*  I know regretting the marriage face and you don't have. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6829.78s)]
*  Okay, but I think that prenup is already so stained. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6831.86s)]
*  Like, it's just so stained. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6835.46s)]
*  I think that if you called it like estate planning, like, for example, like my wife and I did like [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6837.06s)]
*  estate planning and you're just playing for the worst case scenario. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6842.58s)]
*  What if I die? [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6844.9800000000005s)]
*  What if she died? [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6845.62s)]
*  What if everybody died? [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6846.26s)]
*  How fucked up was that? [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6847.06s)]
*  Oh, it's awful. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6847.94s)]
*  What if we both die? [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6849.54s)]
*  And you're like, oh my God. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6850.66s)]
*  What if we both die and your sister dies? [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6851.62s)]
*  And then you're like, oh, shit. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6853.94s)]
*  It's horrifying. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6856.179999999999s)]
*  It's really fucked up. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6856.82s)]
*  But really important. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6857.7s)]
*  But it is important. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6858.9s)]
*  And at no point during it was it this like contentious thing because you're all looking [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6859.7s)]
*  out for the best case scenario of everything. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6864.74s)]
*  And I think prenup is already so radioactive. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6866.5s)]
*  It's like, what is another thing you could do? [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6869.0599999999995s)]
*  But I really like that idea of like people. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6870.98s)]
*  Because you said it best. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6872.98s)]
*  Call it the marital contract. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6874.259999999999s)]
*  Whatever it is. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6875.46s)]
*  The government has a prenup for you, whether you like it or not. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6876.179999999999s)]
*  And most people don't even know what that means. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6878.74s)]
*  And it changes depending on what state you're in. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6880.74s)]
*  That's the part that scares me the most. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6882.5s)]
*  So you don't even. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6883.7s)]
*  The government can change any time they want. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6884.26s)]
*  And you could move to a different state and live there long enough. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6886.0199999999995s)]
*  And now I think that state takes a jurisdiction. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6888.58s)]
*  Yeah, they take precedence. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6891.3s)]
*  Six months. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6892.099999999999s)]
*  You've been there six months. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6892.66s)]
*  They have jurisdiction. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6893.54s)]
*  So the reality is there is nobody that doesn't have a prenup. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6894.26s)]
*  Everyone has a prenup. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6897.219999999999s)]
*  So you could look into what it is. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6898.42s)]
*  The thought that someone can change the terms and conditions and you can't opt out. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6901.7s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6907.38s)]
*  This is the education I think the Americans need. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6907.78s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6908.98s)]
*  Well, and that's the funny thing. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6910.0199999999995s)]
*  Because like a lot of like, I did an interview with Matt Walsh a bunch of months ago on the [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6910.98s)]
*  Daily Wire. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6915.38s)]
*  And he was all about like no fault divorce. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6916.099999999999s)]
*  No fault divorce is the worst. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6918.42s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6919.38s)]
*  So New York is a no fault state. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6920.58s)]
*  Most states are now no fault states. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6922.34s)]
*  Which means you don't have to prove why you're getting divorced. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6923.7s)]
*  You don't have to have fault. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6927.3s)]
*  It used to be you had to show adultery. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6928.66s)]
*  You had to show incurable mental illness. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6931.0599999999995s)]
*  You had to call abandonment. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6932.82s)]
*  So it was great for lawyers because we had the like, before we even got into the real [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6934.42s)]
*  fight, we had to get into a fight of are you allowed to get divorced? [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6938.26s)]
*  Okay. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6940.9800000000005s)]
*  So the states eventually said, look, this is stupid. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6941.54s)]
*  If one person in the marriage has decided the marriage is over, guess what? [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6943.9400000000005s)]
*  The marriage is over. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6946.58s)]
*  So now we're no fault. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6947.3s)]
*  Well, a lot of people on the far right, Matt Walsh, Ben Shapiro, it was like their big [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6948.58s)]
*  flavor at the moment for a little while was they were saying no fault divorce is the worst [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6954.58s)]
*  thing in the whole wide world. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6957.9400000000005s)]
*  Because it incentivizes divorce in a way? [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6959.22s)]
*  It's kind of like saying, you know, we got to get rid of all these emergency rooms because [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6961.62s)]
*  everybody who's in there has broken bones. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6965.22s)]
*  So people must be breaking bones so they can go to the emergency room. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6966.900000000001s)]
*  That's fucking ridiculous. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6969.46s)]
*  Yeah, that logic. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6970.820000000001s)]
*  No, they didn't break it. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6971.62s)]
*  This is just there to solve the problem. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6973.46s)]
*  They have to pretend to care about it. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6975.14s)]
*  What I said to Matt is, look, why wouldn't we have, why would you have barriers to exit? [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6976.26s)]
*  Why don't you have barriers to entry? [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6983.22s)]
*  Why don't you have, you have to take a class or you have to sit down with a person who [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6986.02s)]
*  went through an ugly divorce or like Catholics, they have the pre-Kena where you got to sit [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6989.7s)]
*  down and you talk to couples who've been married for 30, 40 years. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6993.62s)]
*  The guy says, look, you're going to have to say, I'm sorry for some shit you're not sorry [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6996.5s)]
*  for. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6999.46s)]
*  That's part of being married. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=6999.94s)]
*  You go, all right, cool. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7001.0599999999995s)]
*  I can live with that. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7001.94s)]
*  Like have some barriers to entry. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7002.9s)]
*  Like you, you, if you, I adopted a dog from ACC in New York City. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7005.54s)]
*  You know how much fucking paperwork I had to fill out? [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7009.46s)]
*  They wanted to know my third grade English teacher's name. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7011.54s)]
*  Like they wanted to know, did Mrs. Soybell, she think you'd be good? [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7014.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm like, she hasn't seen me in 40 years. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7017.139999999999s)]
*  You need to have a, you want to piss test? [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7018.5s)]
*  Like I'm adopting a dog you were going to kill in two days. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7020.42s)]
*  Like just give me the fucking dog. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7023.22s)]
*  Get married, 50 bucks. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7025.06s)]
*  You can pay all this in Vegas and you're married. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7026.5s)]
*  All right guys, let's take a break for a second. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7028.1s)]
*  I genuinely want to tell you guys about the best protein bar on the planet. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7029.38s)]
*  Okay. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7032.18s)]
*  I mean this sincerely. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7032.5s)]
*  This right here, the David Bar. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7034.26s)]
*  Okay. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7035.94s)]
*  What do we want to have a protein bar? [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7037.7s)]
*  We want fucking protein and we want it to have low calories and ideally we don't want [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7039.14s)]
*  to have that much sugar. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7045.54s)]
*  And then after that, can it not taste like cardboard? [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7046.74s)]
*  Those are the things we want. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7049.219999999999s)]
*  There is no other bar on the planet that's going to give you 28 grams of protein at 150 [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7050.58s)]
*  calories and zero sugar. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7055.219999999999s)]
*  David figured it out. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7056.9s)]
*  Okay. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7058.0199999999995s)]
*  And it tastes good. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7058.34s)]
*  Figured it out. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7058.9s)]
*  I'm telling you right now, it is fantastic. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7059.78s)]
*  It is the best tasting protein bar that I've ever had. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7063.7s)]
*  And I'm not counting the ones that have six grams of protein. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7067.3s)]
*  That's not even a protein bar. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7069.54s)]
*  I'm talking about the ones that are actually marketed as protein bars. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7070.74s)]
*  This has more protein than all of them and it actually is delicious. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7074.18s)]
*  Okay. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7078.58s)]
*  I'm telling you, adequate protein intake is critical for building and preserving muscle [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7079.3s)]
*  mass now and as we age, if you're an old guy like me, that muscle mass is going to be what [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7083.700000000001s)]
*  really allows you to play paddle for the rest of your life. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7089.22s)]
*  Okay. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7091.38s)]
*  I literally, it's the only reason I lift weights is so I can play paddle. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7091.860000000001s)]
*  And unfortunately when I don't do it, I start to get injured. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7094.58s)]
*  It's that horrible. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7097.3s)]
*  So David bars are the first thing that I'm gobbling down in the morning before I go get [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7098.740000000001s)]
*  a workout or afterwards. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7102.98s)]
*  For some reason, you got to get like your weight in protein in a day, [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7105.62s)]
*  which is like almost impossible, but I tried my hardest. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7108.82s)]
*  Anyway, David has the most protein per calorie. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7112.419999999999s)]
*  So eating 100 calories of David will make you feel fuller than eating 100 calories of any other bar. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7115.7s)]
*  David is also now available in stores and NYC. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7120.419999999999s)]
*  So if you're in New York, stop by your local bodega to get your protein fixed and then tell [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7123.0599999999995s)]
*  the guy at the bodega where you heard about it. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7128.339999999999s)]
*  Let them know it came from flagrant. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7130.259999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7131.7s)]
*  That's very important. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7132.02s)]
*  I'm sure that will get back to David. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7132.900000000001s)]
*  Anyway, David comes in six delicious flavors and they're all worth trying. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7134.5s)]
*  Also, if you buy four cartons, you get the fifth one free, [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7138.26s)]
*  which will not happen at the bodega. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7140.580000000001s)]
*  So make sure you do that over at davidprotein.com slash flagrant. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7141.860000000001s)]
*  I'm telling you, this is the truth, man. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7145.9400000000005s)]
*  It's fantastic. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7148.02s)]
*  It's fantastic. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7148.660000000001s)]
*  It's absolutely fantastic. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7149.700000000001s)]
*  Anyway, let's get back to the show. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7151.14s)]
*  All right, guys, I have a question for you. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7152.34s)]
*  What do a mechanic and auto shop owner in Georgia, a taco restaurant operator in Arizona, [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7153.700000000001s)]
*  and a life-saving medical innovator in Tennessee have in common? [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7158.18s)]
*  They're all small business owners thriving on TikTok. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7161.46s)]
*  In the US alone, over 7.5 million businesses, [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7164.74s)]
*  and I'm talking everything from family-owned shops to entrepreneurs who own tons of shit [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7168.34s)]
*  and are simply looking to get more rich. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7172.82s)]
*  They're all using TikTok. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7174.42s)]
*  It's how you compete. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7175.62s)]
*  It's how you grow. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7176.34s)]
*  74% of businesses on TikTok say it's allowed them to scale operations, [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7177.3s)]
*  increase sales, and expand in new locations. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7180.82s)]
*  And you know what that means? [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7183.3s)]
*  That means US jobs. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7184.42s)]
*  There are over 7.5 million US businesses on TikTok employing more than 28 million people, [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7185.7s)]
*  and that number keeps growing. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7190.5s)]
*  Small businesses thrive on TikTok. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7191.94s)]
*  So if you've got a small business, you can learn more about TikTok's contribution to the economy [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7193.54s)]
*  at TikTokEconomicImpact.com. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7197.86s)]
*  My wife is on TikTok now, [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7200.34s)]
*  and Andrew's entire goal is to make her make more money than me and make my life miserable. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7201.86s)]
*  TikTok, that's a platform that will ruin my marriage, [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7205.7s)]
*  but I'm okay with it because if she leaves me, I'm coming after her money. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7208.26s)]
*  Let's get back to the show. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7212.34s)]
*  You know, it's interesting. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7213.3s)]
*  Back in the day, I had a different business manager, [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7214.1s)]
*  and this is when we were about to get married. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7216.26s)]
*  The business manager hit me up on the side. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7217.62s)]
*  By the way, I think that we should get this prenup set over, or whatever like that. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7219.86s)]
*  And I was operating with good faith, right? [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7223.7s)]
*  So I was like, well, why don't you just get a lawyer, [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7227.14s)]
*  and then my wife and I will talk to the lawyer, [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7229.22s)]
*  and then we'll see what the things are, right? [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7231.06s)]
*  But you're already smiling because you know where this is going. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7233.14s)]
*  Yeah, I know where it's going. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7234.74s)]
*  Because I'm like, let's just figure out what these things are. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7235.38s)]
*  She's not against it. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7238.18s)]
*  And we talk to the lawyer, and the lawyer goes, [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7240.42s)]
*  well, I don't know if I should be having this call with you and your wife. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7243.14s)]
*  And I'm like, well, I'm not trying to fuck over my wife. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7246.26s)]
*  It's called potentially adverse interests. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7249.14s)]
*  But there's the perfect example of how could you then go forward with this agreement if, [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7251.38s)]
*  obviously it's rational, but how can you go forward with this agreement [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7258.26s)]
*  if the first time you're talking to a lawyer, he basically says, [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7260.900000000001s)]
*  hey, she shouldn't be on because we're going to try to fuck her. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7264.5s)]
*  Right, right. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7267.06s)]
*  Like to me, I literally was going, just give me a lawyer so they can explain what's going on. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7267.9400000000005s)]
*  And then if this is something that we even feel like we should do. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7272.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7276.02s)]
*  And I can't say, well, because here's the thing. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7276.900000000001s)]
*  What the lawyer is saying, and they don't say it in artful ways, [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7278.58s)]
*  what lawyers are saying in that situation is you have potentially adverse interests. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7281.38s)]
*  More for you is less for her, less for you is more for her, right? [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7285.38s)]
*  So what, but see, again, this is all stuff that technology has made easier. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7288.98s)]
*  So people come to me and they go, look, I want my fiance and I want to talk to you about a prenup. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7293.94s)]
*  I go, look, I'm not allowed to counsel you both, but here's what we can do. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7297.94s)]
*  Let's do it via Zoom, record the entire thing. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7302.82s)]
*  She will hear everything. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7305.62s)]
*  You can play it for whoever you want, including your fiance. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7306.74s)]
*  I can't give her legal advice, but I can give you legal advice and you can play for her [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7309.54s)]
*  every word I say to you so that she doesn't feel intimidated. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7313.86s)]
*  But see, this is the reality is we can do it, solve for the actual problem. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7317.86s)]
*  So what you're saying is you're absolutely right. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7322.0199999999995s)]
*  We're taking an adversarial system and you're hiring lawyers whose job theoretically is to [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7324.099999999999s)]
*  protect their individual client at the expense of the other, which by the way, [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7329.46s)]
*  one of the things I'm least proud of my colleagues for is we're so used to dealing with [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7332.66s)]
*  warring tribes and divorce that then when we're doing a prenup, we approach it the same way. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7338.099999999999s)]
*  And it does leave a bad taste. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7345.139999999999s)]
*  And these fucking people are getting in a car and driving home together. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7346.34s)]
*  Like this is not the same thing as a divorce. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7349.3s)]
*  That was the energy. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7351.7s)]
*  There should be a different approach and there can be. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7352.5s)]
*  We just have to rethink the way we do. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7355.7s)]
*  Even the language, it was like, oh yeah, we just want to protect you. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7357.7s)]
*  And I go, well, my wife's not trying to kill me. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7360.58s)]
*  Why are you using this language as if she's trying to do something nefarious? [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7364.34s)]
*  Protect me from what? [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7367.62s)]
*  Protect me from what? [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7368.42s)]
*  Like, why aren't we protecting ourselves? [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7369.14s)]
*  That's why I'm saying the way that we approach this and as you've talked about on the pod, [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7372.34s)]
*  I think it's been really healthy, which is like, hey, just come together on an agreement [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7376.26s)]
*  that you think is superior than the agreement that the government is going to impose on you. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7380.98s)]
*  Totally. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7385.38s)]
*  Who wouldn't agree to that? [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7385.62s)]
*  Totally useful. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7386.5s)]
*  It makes total sense. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7387.38s)]
*  Why can't you go to- [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7388.18s)]
*  Much easier sell. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7388.74s)]
*  And by the way, I think what you said earlier is absolutely correct. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7389.94s)]
*  Why isn't there a neutral party? [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7392.66s)]
*  It's an opportunity for people to have a really important discussion. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7393.3s)]
*  But why isn't there like a lawyer that wouldn't represent each party, [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7397.219999999999s)]
*  but just someone you could go to for information? [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7400.74s)]
*  There are ways to do it. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7402.26s)]
*  There are people that do it that way. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7403.0599999999995s)]
*  There should be more of that. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7403.94s)]
*  There are lawyers who work collaboratively who'll say, let's all meet together. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7405.139999999999s)]
*  We each have a lawyer. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7408.26s)]
*  There's people that work in mediation to mediate a prenup. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7409.139999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of ways. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7411.86s)]
*  More just info. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7412.58s)]
*  There's no one path up the mountain. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7413.0599999999995s)]
*  Like, you don't even have to do the prenup, but just inform us. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7414.179999999999s)]
*  Maybe we work it all out with you and then we get it. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7416.74s)]
*  There's so many ways to do it. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7418.82s)]
*  But again, we're just used to doing it one way. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7420.34s)]
*  We've handed it off to an adversarial system. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7422.5s)]
*  And so to a person with a hammer, everything looks like a nail. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7424.9s)]
*  Like to a person who argues for a living, everything looks like an invitation to have a fucking argument. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7427.22s)]
*  I get paid to be paranoid. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7431.139999999999s)]
*  My mother tells me she loves me. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7432.58s)]
*  I ask for references. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7433.78s)]
*  Like, that's my job. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7434.66s)]
*  Like, that's my job because I see the worst in people all day long. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7436.66s)]
*  That's heavy. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7440.26s)]
*  So what you have to do is you have to get to a place where you go, okay, look, [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7441.46s)]
*  this is a conversation. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7445.22s)]
*  I guarantee when you and your wife did that estate planning, [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7447.54s)]
*  you probably had to have some conversations about like, hey, something happens. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7450.26s)]
*  Like, who watches the kids? [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7454.18s)]
*  Like, and what do we do about this? [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7455.860000000001s)]
*  Do we trust that family member? [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7456.9800000000005s)]
*  Are they responsible? [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7458.900000000001s)]
*  But I tell you, I bet that that deepens the level of connection, intimacy, the two of you have. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7459.9400000000005s)]
*  And by the way, you go doing that estate planning. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7465.780000000001s)]
*  Like, we are never more alive than when we're in the presence of death. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7468.660000000001s)]
*  Like, when you stop and think about, holy shit, if I lost this person, [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7471.54s)]
*  like, what would that feel like? [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7476.34s)]
*  You want to hug that person 50 times more. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7477.86s)]
*  So to me, like early on in a relationship, when you're still madly in love with each other [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7481.38s)]
*  and you're about to sign up for this, you know, I'm marrying you, [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7485.3s)]
*  it's going to be you, you and only you. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7488.099999999999s)]
*  That's the time to say, you know what, if we ever hurt each other, if we ever, [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7489.7s)]
*  what do we owe each other? [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7494.0199999999995s)]
*  How do we handle that? [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7495.0599999999995s)]
*  Like, how do I love you? [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7496.0199999999995s)]
*  How do I make you feel safe? [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7497.219999999999s)]
*  That's a great time to have that conversation. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7498.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7500.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7501.3s)]
*  This is really healthy. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7501.54s)]
*  I really think there should be a neutral party that you could go to for information [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7503.7s)]
*  about like the laws in the state you are. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7508.98s)]
*  There are. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7510.66s)]
*  There's mediators. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7510.98s)]
*  You can go to a mediator. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7511.78s)]
*  You can go to an attorney and say to the attorney, look, I just want to have an educational [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7512.82s)]
*  conversation about this. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7516.5s)]
*  I don't want you to draft the prenup necessarily. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7517.86s)]
*  Again, I think you're going to see in the coming years, I intend to be part of it, [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7520.66s)]
*  you're going to see more of the democratization of prenups. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7524.74s)]
*  Because I think the younger generation, like I'm older than all of you, [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7528.42s)]
*  I have to tell you, one of the things, like I look at my 20-something year old sons, [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7532.66s)]
*  and I have a lot of hope for the future because I think that you're looking at a situation [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7536.259999999999s)]
*  and going, okay, but why do we do it that way? [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7540.98s)]
*  Like, why do we do it? [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7543.219999999999s)]
*  We don't have to do it that way. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7544.099999999999s)]
*  And it's okay for people to say, hey, you know what? [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7545.7s)]
*  We can do it however we want to do it. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7548.0199999999995s)]
*  It just left a bad taste in both of our mouths. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7551.139999999999s)]
*  I understood where the business manager was coming from because he probably has these [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7553.299999999999s)]
*  clients that got a bunch of gold diggers trying to go after him. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7556.58s)]
*  But it's like, I don't have that relationship with my wife. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7558.66s)]
*  I mean, I had a couple bucks, but it's not what it was now. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7562.18s)]
*  And we were operating in good faith. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7565.22s)]
*  It wasn't even like, how do we keep this from you? [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7567.06s)]
*  And then these lawyers are on the side or trying to talk to me going, hey, well, [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7570.34s)]
*  they should have somebody else do it and then we don't talk. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7574.02s)]
*  And I'm like, guys, this feels like I'm trying to screw over the person that I'm about to [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7576.34s)]
*  spend the rest of my life with. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7581.3s)]
*  And I don't feel comfortable with that. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7582.42s)]
*  But I'd say something. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7584.58s)]
*  Look, your career has been characterized by being somewhat iconoclastic. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7585.38s)]
*  I've been a fan since the 441 days. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7589.94s)]
*  I'm sure when you said, I'm going to put this out myself. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7594.66s)]
*  Some people who genuinely care about you and genuinely wanted to see you succeed said, dude, [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7599.38s)]
*  don't do it that way. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7606.74s)]
*  You'll never make a dime. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7608.259999999999s)]
*  And by the way, they were not trying to mislead you. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7609.86s)]
*  They weren't trying to hurt you. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7612.0199999999995s)]
*  It's not that they didn't trust you. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7613.139999999999s)]
*  They were looking at it and going, dude, I don't want to see it go wrong for you. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7614.82s)]
*  Okay. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7619.22s)]
*  So people can in very good faith give very fucking bad advice. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7619.62s)]
*  Because if that's the right way to do it, they did it fucking wrong. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7625.22s)]
*  They did it wrong. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7631.62s)]
*  Right? [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7632.660000000001s)]
*  Because if you go, no, no, I'm going to do it this way. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7633.06s)]
*  And you knock it out of the park like you did. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7635.38s)]
*  They go, well, what the fuck was that? [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7638.18s)]
*  Why did I do it this other way? [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7639.700000000001s)]
*  And the answer is because it was peer pressure from dead people. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7641.22s)]
*  You're right. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7645.14s)]
*  We get caught up in these antiquated systems and they either work for us [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7645.62s)]
*  or we believe that we're invested in them and then we don't want to break things. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7648.74s)]
*  And yet, and I don't mean to use you as an example. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7651.46s)]
*  Please. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7653.54s)]
*  I'm not picking on you. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7653.62s)]
*  Please. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7654.42s)]
*  You had the intelligence to think of this and the balls to try it. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7655.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7661.0599999999995s)]
*  Okay. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7661.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7661.86s)]
*  And yet when it comes to getting married, there was never the thought of like, oh, you know, [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7662.9s)]
*  why am I going to let the government impose a rule set? [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7668.9s)]
*  Why wouldn't we figure out a way to do it? [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7671.219999999999s)]
*  Now, why? [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7672.74s)]
*  I don't blame you for that. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7673.219999999999s)]
*  I think it's just never been a conversation we have as a society. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7674.26s)]
*  My parents also had a really good marriage. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7677.54s)]
*  And I think when you come from broken marriages, it's a lot easier to look at how badly it could go. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7679.38s)]
*  And I think that I'm very lucky to come from a very healthy marriage. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7685.94s)]
*  And so in my mind, I'm like, oh yeah, it's just going to go like that. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7690.34s)]
*  So maybe there's a little naiveté in there. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7693.7s)]
*  Right. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7696.0199999999995s)]
*  And listen, I think there's a beauty to that. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7696.26s)]
*  Like I wish I knew no astronomy when the stars appear. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7697.94s)]
*  I liked it when I was like, look at the pretty lights in the sky. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7703.14s)]
*  Actually, this is something that flamed out a million years ago. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7705.860000000001s)]
*  And lights just reaching. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7708.34s)]
*  I was like, oh, fuck. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7709.38s)]
*  I wish I didn't know that. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7710.18s)]
*  I just thought it was nice. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7711.3s)]
*  Ignorance is bliss. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7712.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7713.06s)]
*  So I think there's something very beautiful about not knowing this stuff. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7713.54s)]
*  But again, I am a fan. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7717.14s)]
*  I think the truth is actually even more beautiful. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7718.900000000001s)]
*  I think when two people say, I'm going to give you the ability to hurt me. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7722.74s)]
*  I love you enough. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7727.9400000000005s)]
*  Because I have to tell you something. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7728.74s)]
*  I think it's fucking insane to love anything. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7730.26s)]
*  I really do. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7733.06s)]
*  Like a dog, a kid. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7733.94s)]
*  You're going to lose it. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7736.66s)]
*  Everything you love, you're going to lose some day. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7738.179999999999s)]
*  So to love something is to accept the inevitability [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7741.46s)]
*  that it's going to break your fucking heart someday. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7745.86s)]
*  And yet we do it anyway, because it's the best thing. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7748.82s)]
*  Because life is better with it. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7751.7s)]
*  Right. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7753.0599999999995s)]
*  So to me, that makes it more beautiful to say, you know what? [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7753.379999999999s)]
*  If you break my fucking heart, it will have been worth it. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7757.379999999999s)]
*  It will have been worth it because we got to do this. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7761.86s)]
*  Sold. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7764.0199999999995s)]
*  Sold. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7765.94s)]
*  Akash is getting a prenup. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7766.66s)]
*  All right. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7767.86s)]
*  Good. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7768.179999999999s)]
*  Can we ask the cultural questions? [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7770.099999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7771.38s)]
*  Who's the worst in divorce? [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7772.179999999999s)]
*  Culturally, ethnically, racially. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7774.179999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7777.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7777.94s)]
*  Like who's the most ruthless? [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7778.9s)]
*  Who treats the... [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7780.099999999999s)]
*  Those are a bunch of different questions you just threw off. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7781.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7783.62s)]
*  I mean, what I'll say is like the Russians, [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7784.82s)]
*  Russians, there's, you know, Chekhov's plays are dark for a fucking reason. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7788.1s)]
*  Like the winters are long. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7792.02s)]
*  So the Russians come in sometimes to professional hit. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7793.14s)]
*  Like they get cold. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7796.02s)]
*  Really? [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7797.22s)]
*  The husband to the wife you're saying or the wife to the husband? [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7797.7s)]
*  The wife more so even. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7799.7s)]
*  Russian women are, we used to call them the red menace sometimes in the courthouse. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7801.62s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7804.900000000001s)]
*  What would they... [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7806.26s)]
*  Because like they're, I mean, God, it's really hard to say. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7807.06s)]
*  I mean, you know, like the stereotypes, [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7810.900000000001s)]
*  sometimes stereotypes are a real time saver. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7813.7s)]
*  Let's just call that out. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7815.62s)]
*  Let's just call that out. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7817.9400000000005s)]
*  Sometimes they're wildly inaccurate. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7821.14s)]
*  I get it. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7823.06s)]
*  Like sometimes they're a real time saver. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7824.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7826.02s)]
*  And anyone who's ever dated a Latina woman, [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7826.58s)]
*  they will burn your fucking house down and then ask who Maria was who called. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7831.54s)]
*  And you're like, that's from work. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7837.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7839.06s)]
*  She's like, well, you should have told me that before. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7839.3s)]
*  And you're like, before you burn the fucking house down? [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7841.22s)]
*  Like so that can be bad. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7843.860000000001s)]
*  Russian women in my experience professionally, not personally, professionally, [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7846.34s)]
*  they will, when you are now the enemy, when you have crossed that line, [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7852.5s)]
*  they get fucking ice cold. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7857.06s)]
*  And there is nothing... [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7859.14s)]
*  When you're married to a Russian woman, there is nothing she won't do for you. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7860.74s)]
*  And when you're divorcing a Russian woman, there is nothing she won't do to you. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7864.18s)]
*  Like she will fuck your shit right up. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7868.0199999999995s)]
*  Give an example of like, you don't have to give obviously a person, [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7869.78s)]
*  but something that they might have asked you to do or told you about. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7873.06s)]
*  Oh, I mean, they'll surveil the guy. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7876.26s)]
*  Like they'll have people follow him. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7878.18s)]
*  They'll blow him up to the IRS. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7879.860000000001s)]
*  And they'll shoot first and ask questions later. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7885.14s)]
*  Like they'll call the IRS and they'll go, by the way, I called the IRS. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7888.26s)]
*  Not I'm thinking about calling. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7892.42s)]
*  So I can go, that's a terrible fucking idea. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7894.580000000001s)]
*  Like, nope. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7897.46s)]
*  They're like, oh, I did it already. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7898.1s)]
*  And you're like, okay, then I guess let's figure out what we're going to do with that. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7899.46s)]
*  So that's a big one. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7903.06s)]
*  Terms of who, I mean, I will say again, I'm being very stereotypical. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7906.1s)]
*  Italian women, a lot of Italian women in my experience, [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7910.5s)]
*  they're the most willing to put up with infidelity. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7914.5s)]
*  Okay, with the gumanas. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7923.54s)]
*  It's like he's making a fool of himself. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7929.780000000001s)]
*  But it's like, did you, don't bring him to restaurants we go to. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7932.18s)]
*  Don't bring your fucking whore around. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7936.18s)]
*  But it really is. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7940.42s)]
*  It's like, I don't want to don't ask, don't tell. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7941.38s)]
*  But if somebody sees you out with the girlfriend, you're making a fool of me. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7943.860000000001s)]
*  You're making a fool of me now. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7948.18s)]
*  Like you're running around with some girl, you're making a fool of yourself. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7949.860000000001s)]
*  And you go ahead and make a fucking fool of yourself. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7952.26s)]
*  But you run around with some girl in our friend's seat, you're making a fool of me. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7953.78s)]
*  That's a different vibe. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7957.3s)]
*  Why do you think that is culturally? [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7958.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7960.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm not Italian. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7961.38s)]
*  So, you know, I'm German. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7962.18s)]
*  We're all about the blitzkrieg. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7964.02s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7966.9800000000005s)]
*  I mean, I think it's all cultural. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7967.700000000001s)]
*  I think it's the way people, like what you said, you observe your parents' marriage. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7970.1s)]
*  You observe that becomes normalized family. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7973.860000000001s)]
*  And you just sort of go, okay, this is how marriage is. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7976.26s)]
*  Got it. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7978.820000000001s)]
*  So there are a lot culturally, the idea of a guman, like the idea of like, you know, [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7979.3s)]
*  men are fucking idiot, they run around, whatever. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7983.38s)]
*  Who does he come home to? [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7985.860000000001s)]
*  Who does he take care of? [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7987.46s)]
*  Who does he love? [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7988.58s)]
*  Who does he have kids with? [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7989.14s)]
*  That's what matters. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7990.26s)]
*  Maybe it's like certain cultures place more value on different things. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7991.14s)]
*  So if he's like a dedicated husband, he's a provider, a protector, [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7995.860000000001s)]
*  there's a lot of emphasis on those things. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=7999.780000000001s)]
*  And if he's killing in those three things, and then he does this little shit on the side. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8002.02s)]
*  Whereas there might be other cultures. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8006.26s)]
*  I think American culture puts like a lot of emphasis on fidelity. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8007.62s)]
*  Tremendous. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8010.660000000001s)]
*  And maybe more so than European cultures. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8011.46s)]
*  America has, I mean, the French like, I think find like infidelity charming. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8014.26s)]
*  It's sort of like, well, you know, I've been taking my wife to Paris for years. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8022.42s)]
*  But it is this sort of like a sense of, you know, where existentialism came from. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8031.54s)]
*  They invented, you know, existentialism, democracy and the nationality. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8035.14s)]
*  They came up with a lot. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8040.98s)]
*  And one of the things they look at it like, yeah, you know, people have dalliance. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8042.1s)]
*  Because there's a difference between an affair and a dalliance. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8045.3s)]
*  Like a dalliance is like you said earlier, like, you know, you do some dumb shit, [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8048.26s)]
*  you hook up with this person, doesn't really mean anything to you. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8051.860000000001s)]
*  You told him you're a race car driver named Steve. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8054.26s)]
*  I'm not making that personal. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8057.700000000001s)]
*  I was a race car driver. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8060.42s)]
*  No. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8061.860000000001s)]
*  So the truth is, like, I think there's a difference between that and an ongoing affair. [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8062.34s)]
*  Right. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8066.26s)]
*  You know, like I found my soulmate and it's this other person. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8066.740000000001s)]
*  That's a whole different level of stupid. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8070.1s)]
*  Understand the difference until like getting married. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8071.86s)]
*  Now I'm like, oh, I see. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8074.259999999999s)]
*  That's a whole different thing. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8075.299999999999s)]
*  It's a whole different thing. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8076.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8077.38s)]
*  Well, and that's where I like people putting prenups sometimes. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8078.0199999999995s)]
*  People put in infidelity clauses sometimes. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8082.5s)]
*  In the prenups. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8085.38s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8086.259999999999s)]
*  And I discourage people from doing that because [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8086.9s)]
*  in order to make something legally enforceable, you have to define it. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8090.099999999999s)]
*  And so how do you define infidelity? [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8093.54s)]
*  Because if you define infidelity as like genital contact, that's one thing. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8095.54s)]
*  But like, which would be more upsetting? [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8099.94s)]
*  Like that your ex got drunk and kissed some dude or that she was texting this guy every [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8102.339999999999s)]
*  single day and confiding her most personal secrets in with him? [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8108.259999999999s)]
*  And like that to me, that's much more of a betrayal. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8111.78s)]
*  It depends on how much less work I have to do. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8114.5s)]
*  Honestly. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8116.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8116.74s)]
*  You're not really annoying me. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8117.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8118.259999999999s)]
*  Like you're like delegating that. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8118.419999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8119.94s)]
*  Exactly the word I use. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8120.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8121.78s)]
*  1000%. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8122.259999999999s)]
*  That's better. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8123.0599999999995s)]
*  But again, personal decisions, right? [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8123.78s)]
*  Like this is a personal choice. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8125.62s)]
*  Everybody's going to have a different definition of what it is. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8127.139999999999s)]
*  It's offensive. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8129.38s)]
*  A conversation worth having. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8130.1s)]
*  What is cheating to you? [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8131.7s)]
*  What constitutes cheating? [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8134.42s)]
*  This is going to become more relevant. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8135.54s)]
*  What's the weirdest thing that you've constituted as cheating in a prenup? [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8137.22s)]
*  I discourage those clauses. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8140.58s)]
*  So usually I don't put them in there and I get people, I talk people out of them because [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8142.1s)]
*  I'm good at persuading people. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8145.38s)]
*  But the weirdest infidelity clause I ever put in is that they wanted to very strictly [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8147.06s)]
*  define what constituted infidelity. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8152.26s)]
*  So like oral genital contact and genital to genital contact. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8154.42s)]
*  And then there was a whole... [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8159.3s)]
*  Oral to genital. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8159.9400000000005s)]
*  No, what was great... [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8161.06s)]
*  Somebody's got to do it. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8162.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8163.38s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8164.1s)]
*  What's going on? [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8165.38s)]
*  What I thought was so funny is they wanted to talk about digital to genital contact, [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8166.26s)]
*  meaning digitally. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8171.62s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8172.58s)]
*  And I mean, first of all, I thought it was kind of... [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8174.42s)]
*  Get out. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8176.1s)]
*  Grow up. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8176.5s)]
*  Grow up. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8177.22s)]
*  Because I was like, like hand jobs? [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8177.46s)]
*  Like that's a thing? [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8179.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8180.42s)]
*  Like I thought it was like a Betamax. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8180.66s)]
*  It's like outdated technology. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8182.1s)]
*  Like how do you give a hand job? [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8184.34s)]
*  You be a fucking grown up, use your mouth. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8185.38s)]
*  Like that's insane. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8186.9800000000005s)]
*  Hand job. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8188.66s)]
*  You know what that is? [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8189.379999999999s)]
*  That woman is smart because that's the massage pose. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8190.259999999999s)]
*  She's finding a way around it. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8192.9s)]
*  That girl is on it. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8194.98s)]
*  Anal is open still though. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8196.1s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like... [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8197.22s)]
*  It's theoretically open. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8198.02s)]
*  Well actually that would there be an anal loophole. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8199.619999999999s)]
*  Not say did like anal to genital contact. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8202.9s)]
*  As an attorney, that's what we do. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8205.46s)]
*  Shit, I think that Mark's head went there first. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8206.66s)]
*  Mark found a loophole. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8209.3s)]
*  You're always like that. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8210.34s)]
*  Yeah, you're hired. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8211.539999999999s)]
*  This comedy thing doesn't work out. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8213.539999999999s)]
*  You're hired. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8214.82s)]
*  Before we get out of here, [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8216.58s)]
*  what you were going to mention the super high net worth of states [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8217.94s)]
*  and just the history of marriage in general. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8221.62s)]
*  How does marriage start? [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8224.42s)]
*  Well marriage, I mean, you know, marriage as a legal definition, [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8225.94s)]
*  not the idea of a pair bond and two people. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8229.460000000001s)]
*  That started in a cave somewhere. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8231.300000000001s)]
*  But marriage, legal marriage started essentially during feudalism. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8232.900000000001s)]
*  It was essentially we were joining clans. [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8236.820000000002s)]
*  We were bringing annexing lands, bringing together armies. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8239.94s)]
*  Like it was some Game of Thrones shit. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8243.140000000001s)]
*  It was basically people saying we're joining our families together. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8245.06s)]
*  We're having children together and merging these clans, [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8248.26s)]
*  merging these lands, merging these armies. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8252.26s)]
*  It was essentially a land and wealth preservation technique. [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8254.5s)]
*  So it was a financial agreement more so than an emotional one. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8257.699999999999s)]
*  And then the idea of people marrying for love was a very different thing. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8260.58s)]
*  How old is that concept? [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8266.98s)]
*  That concept goes back to like the, I mean, depends on how. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8268.34s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, I think there was always a romantic element to things. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8271.94s)]
*  There was always a connection. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8275.460000000001s)]
*  But the idea that like arranged marriage was not the right move [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8276.42s)]
*  and that you should choose who it is that you want to marry [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8280.980000000001s)]
*  and that it should be based on the criteria. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8284.5s)]
*  So gay. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8286.42s)]
*  Find sexually attractive and compelling as a gay thing. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8286.980000000001s)]
*  That's like the 40s and the 50s is when Hallmark cards started that shit. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8290.58s)]
*  You know, like what most people call love today [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8295.78s)]
*  was something that was invented in the 50s to sell shampoo. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8300.34s)]
*  Wow. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8303.460000000001s)]
*  The idea that like, you know, I just have this feeling in the pit of my stomach [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8306.1s)]
*  and that means we should sign up for a governmental contract and fuck. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8311.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8315.220000000001s)]
*  Like that is not like that's you had to sell that to people [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8315.62s)]
*  and you sold it kind of insidiously without telling them the whole thing. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8319.94s)]
*  Nobody read the terms and conditions. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8323.86s)]
*  Right. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8325.54s)]
*  Right. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8326.1s)]
*  So I really think the idea of like modern marriage is very, very different [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8326.5s)]
*  than what our grandparents signed up for. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8333.62s)]
*  It needs different requirements. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8335.78s)]
*  There is no scenario where I forget who was who said it, but you know, [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8338.74s)]
*  we are primitive biological creatures living in medieval institutions [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8343.54s)]
*  holding God-like technology in our hands. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8352.34s)]
*  How do you think that ends? [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8356.019999999999s)]
*  Like you think it ends well? [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8358.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8360.339999999998s)]
*  Or do you think it ends with some really uncomfortable shit [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8360.74s)]
*  that we've got to get our hands in and figure out? [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8364.339999999998s)]
*  Right. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8366.9s)]
*  And all I'm suggesting, like all of my public work is about saying, [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8367.3s)]
*  because it's just to say to people, look, guys, like I love love, [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8372.66s)]
*  but I don't believe in fucking fairy tales. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8377.699999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8379.939999999999s)]
*  So why can't we have an honest conversation? [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8380.339999999998s)]
*  Because I don't think that understanding the realities of marriage [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8382.58s)]
*  and the legalities of marriage takes away from the beauty [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8387.06s)]
*  of deep connection with a romantic partner and building a life together. [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8390.58s)]
*  Period. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8394.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8397.06s)]
*  Beautifully said. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8397.3s)]
*  Any other questions, boys? [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8398.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8399.3s)]
*  Who has the most volatile divorces, heteros, gays, or lesbians? [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8399.62s)]
*  That's a great question. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8404.82s)]
*  Lesbian couples have the highest rate of domestic violence. [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8408.18s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8410.74s)]
*  I remember saying to a colleague of mine, a gay man, an attorney, [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8412.34s)]
*  the first time I did a lesbian divorce, I said to him, wow, man, this is fucking ugly. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8417.38s)]
*  And he looked at me and he went, it's two women. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8424.58s)]
*  And I went, OK. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8428.74s)]
*  You know, so that's, I mean, yeah. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8431.14s)]
*  Sometimes Al asks a question he knows the answer to. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8432.98s)]
*  Lesbian drama can be a big thing. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8436.18s)]
*  Attorney. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8437.78s)]
*  Gay men, you know, gay men, it's changed a lot because there was a time where gay men [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8438.26s)]
*  very often didn't have kids. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8446.1s)]
*  And there were even countries that refused to let gay men adopt, [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8449.22s)]
*  and there was not surrogacy law, and reproductive rights hadn't gone where it is now, [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8452.82s)]
*  and there wasn't marriage equality. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8456.5s)]
*  So gay men had a lot of assets. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8458.18s)]
*  Because if you don't have fucking kids, you get a lot of extra money. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8460.26s)]
*  Right. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8462.42s)]
*  Like for real, if you didn't have kids, you're like, yeah, that's a Ferrari, this kid. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8462.9s)]
*  And this kid's like a fucking house in the Hamptons. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8466.58s)]
*  Like you got kids are expensive. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8468.98s)]
*  So gay men just they didn't have kids. [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8470.98s)]
*  So they just had tons of fucking assets and they would argue over them. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8473.22s)]
*  In terms of vitriol, I don't think there's a pattern to it. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8478.5s)]
*  I think the reality is like everybody brings a different kind of crazy to it. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8481.7s)]
*  And divorce doesn't make people crazy. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8486.66s)]
*  It just takes the crazy they had and turns the volume way up on it. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8488.9s)]
*  So if someone was already anxious, now they're going to have like a full on panic disorder. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8492.98s)]
*  Because that's the part that's funny to me. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8497.94s)]
*  What's really funny to me is people come in and they'll say to me with a straight face, [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8499.619999999999s)]
*  I can't believe my husband's being such a vindictive, cheap asshole. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8504.5s)]
*  And I go, really? [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8508.74s)]
*  Like during the marriage, what was he like? [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8509.46s)]
*  And she's like, oh, he was a vindictive, cheap asshole. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8512.02s)]
*  I'm like, well, you're divorcing the fucking person you were married to. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8514.5s)]
*  Like if this person was petty as fuck and nasty and selfish, [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8518.18s)]
*  then that's who they're going to be when they get divorced. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8522.42s)]
*  Like if you're married to a realistic person who's prone to compromise [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8524.66s)]
*  and concedes the possibility of their own error when you get divorced. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8528.900000000001s)]
*  They'll do that. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8532.26s)]
*  Like my ex-wife's a lovely fucking person. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8533.220000000001s)]
*  Like I love her. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8535.460000000001s)]
*  She's great. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8536.18s)]
*  There's a lot of people I love but wouldn't want to be fucking married. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8536.5s)]
*  How was your divorce with her? [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8538.26s)]
*  Super friendly. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8539.62s)]
*  We went to a mediator. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8540.34s)]
*  We figured out what it was. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8541.300000000001s)]
*  Because I've been wondering. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8542.34s)]
*  Kids were five and seven. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8542.900000000001s)]
*  We've had 20 years since then. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8544.18s)]
*  She's remarried, couldn't be happier to a great guy who's fucking nothing like me. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8545.54s)]
*  Patient, quiet, sensitive. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8550.02s)]
*  She was married to me for a number of years. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8552.820000000002s)]
*  I'd come home and she'd start telling me about her day. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8556.42s)]
*  I'd be like, come on, skip to the end. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8558.58s)]
*  Wait, let's go. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8559.78s)]
*  You gotta just fucking move. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8560.820000000002s)]
*  I got to restate on fucking comics here. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8561.94s)]
*  And I'm running the conversation. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8564.02s)]
*  I don't even think she stood a chance. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8565.62s)]
*  And the guy she's married to now, she'll sit there and he'll tell her. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8570.18s)]
*  And then my cousin said this. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8575.380000000001s)]
*  And he's genuinely interested. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8576.5s)]
*  Like he's genuinely interested. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8579.94s)]
*  And I look at him like we are made different. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8581.460000000001s)]
*  We're just made different. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8583.7s)]
*  And he's perfect for her. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8584.58s)]
*  I love enough to be like he's perfect for her. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8585.78s)]
*  And I look at that. [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8588.740000000002s)]
*  But that's what, when I married her, that's who she was. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8589.62s)]
*  When I had kids with her, that's who she was. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8594.18s)]
*  And that's why we've had a really successful. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8596.34s)]
*  And by the way, I do not believe that that marriage was unsuccessful because it ended in divorce. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8599.060000000001s)]
*  It produced two amazing kids who love their mother, love their father. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8604.02s)]
*  Get along with all of us like they're healthy, well-adjusted young men. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8608.26s)]
*  So to me, just because something ends doesn't mean it wasn't successful. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8612.5s)]
*  And I think we have to approach relationships that way. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8616.5s)]
*  That's why, again, having the conversation early on when you're still madly in love and in that romantic, [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8618.740000000002s)]
*  that's the time to talk about. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8625.380000000001s)]
*  If a person says to you, if every ex-boyfriend they have, [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8628.26s)]
*  they're like that guy was a piece of shit. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8632.58s)]
*  Every ex-girlfriend you have, you're like she was such a piece of shit. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8634.9s)]
*  That tells you something about this fucking person. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8637.78s)]
*  Either that they have abysmally bad judgment or maybe you're the fucking problem. [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8640.82s)]
*  And so I think it's worthwhile to have conversations when things start about how they end. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8646.82s)]
*  What's the dumbest reason you've ever seen for a divorce? [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8653.460000000001s)]
*  Just on a personal basis. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8656.26s)]
*  You're like, oh, this is stupid. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8657.220000000001s)]
*  We had a lot of like weird political divorces since 2016. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8659.54s)]
*  No way. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8662.74s)]
*  Wow. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8663.38s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8663.859999999999s)]
*  People that were like, hey, watch this Fox News, I'm out. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8665.14s)]
*  Like you watch his Newsmax, I'm gone. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8669.22s)]
*  He voted for Trump. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8671.859999999999s)]
*  Just because he has good taste. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8672.66s)]
*  No, but for real, like political shit. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8674.66s)]
*  The saddest one I ever had was this guy was in his late 80s [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8680.82s)]
*  and he left his wife of like 50 or 60 years for a 50-something-year-old woman [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8685.22s)]
*  that he was having an affair with. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8692.34s)]
*  Robin the Crane. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8693.62s)]
*  And what was saddest about it to me was not that this like 60-year marriage was ending. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8694.1s)]
*  It was that, holy shit, I'm still going to be led around by my dick when I'm in my 80s. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8699.140000000001s)]
*  Like I legit thought like I'm not going to be chained to an idiot forever. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8705.7s)]
*  Like I thought in my 80s, like a beautiful woman would walk by and I would be like, oh, [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8709.86s)]
*  a human being. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8713.94s)]
*  Like I would just be, and instead I'm like, oh my God, I'm going to be 86 [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8714.660000000002s)]
*  and still want to fucking chase skirt. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8719.46s)]
*  Like that's fucked. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8721.859999999999s)]
*  We're never going to be free. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8723.859999999999s)]
*  So that to me was like, yeah, people get divorced for some crazy shit. [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8725.779999999999s)]
*  What's the most petty thing you saw in a divorce? [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8729.779999999999s)]
*  I once had a divorce that was, there was a $25 million marital estate. [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8732.339999999998s)]
*  They burned several hundred thousand dollars each in council fees. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8737.619999999999s)]
*  We'd gone through a bunch of litigation. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8741.14s)]
*  We managed to settle the case. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8743.14s)]
*  And the only thing we were down to was the division of personal property. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8745.46s)]
*  And we couldn't agree on who got a $45 toaster oven and the settlement blew up. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8749.619999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8754.74s)]
*  What? [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8755.38s)]
*  The settlement blew up. [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8755.859999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8757.06s)]
*  $45 fucking dollar. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8757.539999999999s)]
*  Did you not just go all by one? [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8759.699999999999s)]
*  I actually did that. [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8761.699999999999s)]
*  I actually said I'm on Amazon right now. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8762.74s)]
*  Prime delivery. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8765.38s)]
*  I will buy everyone in this room this toaster. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8766.419999999998s)]
*  We could just sign the fucking deal. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8769.3s)]
*  It's never about the toaster. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8770.74s)]
*  It wasn't about the fucking toaster. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8771.619999999999s)]
*  For real? [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8773.06s)]
*  But I will tell you, I mean, I have a lot of stories that I will tell you. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8773.699999999999s)]
*  This is one you'll appreciate. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8778.26s)]
*  So I had a client who was a devout, fundamentalist Christian. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8779.94s)]
*  And he was later convicted actually of molesting kids and went to jail. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8784.66s)]
*  But that's a side note. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8789.06s)]
*  See, it's not just Catholics. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8789.94s)]
*  It's not just Catholics. [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8790.74s)]
*  Yeah, it's not just Catholics. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8791.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's all of you. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8792.58s)]
*  It's all of you. [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8793.54s)]
*  No, but he was a great, he was a, you know, he was a client that was, he had a lot of money. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8795.14s)]
*  And we had worked very hard to negotiate a settlement of his case. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8801.380000000001s)]
*  And the day comes to sign the settlement and to do what's called a voir dire, which is what [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8806.019999999999s)]
*  the judge says to each party. [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8810.58s)]
*  Do you understand the settlement? [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8812.1s)]
*  Did you agree to it or did you rest? [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8813.14s)]
*  You know, so these are the steps. [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8814.9s)]
*  But like, it was great. [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8816.26s)]
*  I got him a great deal, like a great deal. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8817.859999999999s)]
*  Like this was way better than it would have been at trial. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8820.98s)]
*  And he didn't have to go through the trial. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8823.14s)]
*  And this was great for him. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8824.5s)]
*  And he meets me at the courthouse morning of it. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8826.1s)]
*  And he says, Jim, I need to talk to you. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8828.1s)]
*  I spoke to God last night. [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8831.38s)]
*  I prayed on it. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8832.9s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8834.9s)]
*  And God said to me that I should not, that I should take it to trial. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8835.539999999999s)]
*  And I said, that is a terrible idea. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8840.98s)]
*  And I explained to him again, here's all the ways that we're getting value here. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8843.46s)]
*  Here's all the things. [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8846.42s)]
*  This is what it should be. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8847.3s)]
*  And he said, no, I'm sorry. [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8848.9s)]
*  I prayed on it. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8850.1s)]
*  And the Lord has said to me, you know, so of course it blew up. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8850.9s)]
*  The whole thing went haywire. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8855.619999999999s)]
*  We start the trial, the lunch break. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8858.18s)]
*  I go back and my partner, Colin, [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8860.9s)]
*  it's been my law partner for many years. [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8862.5s)]
*  I go back to him and I tell him what happened. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8864.1s)]
*  And he looks at me and he goes, you know, you played that all wrong, Jim. [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8866.1s)]
*  I said, what? [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8868.34s)]
*  He goes, what you should have said is, what time did you talk to God? [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8868.82s)]
*  1030. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8875.38s)]
*  Okay. [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8876.18s)]
*  At 11, I talked to God. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8877.14s)]
*  And he said, Jim, my son in whom I am well pleased. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8881.7s)]
*  My blessings upon you. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8887.62s)]
*  By the way, are you going to see Steve later? [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8890.02s)]
*  When you do, tell him, forget that shit I said earlier. [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8892.98s)]
*  You should take the deal. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8895.78s)]
*  I just like it's unfalsifiable. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8896.66s)]
*  I try to hit him back with a voicemail. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8898.42s)]
*  Just say he's like, if you can't disprove what God said to him, [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8901.94s)]
*  he can't disprove what God said to you. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8904.9s)]
*  You could have just said, I talked to God a half hour later and he said, take the fucking deal. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8906.58s)]
*  So if that ever happens to me again, [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8911.38s)]
*  were you kind of satisfied when you saw it go against him in court? [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8913.78s)]
*  And does that happen? [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8916.34s)]
*  Or like you're in court, you realize this person sucks and it's [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8917.06s)]
*  under the doctrine of fuck around and find out. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8920.02s)]
*  He fucked around and he found out. [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8924.02s)]
*  I mean, you know, and there's listening, man, I give people advice and I tell clients all the time, [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8925.62s)]
*  like, look, 850 bucks an hour, I'll mow your fucking lawn. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8929.78s)]
*  I don't care. [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8932.5s)]
*  Like I was a waiter. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8933.060000000001s)]
*  I've done worse shit for less money. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8933.94s)]
*  But like you're paying me for advice. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8935.7s)]
*  So if you want to pay me for advice and ignore it, go ahead. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8937.86s)]
*  Your shit blows up. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8941.62s)]
*  It's good for me. [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8942.66s)]
*  Like the more protracted your case is, the better it is for me. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8944.1s)]
*  I'm trying to put myself out of business here. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8947.14s)]
*  Like I'm trying to settle your case. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8950.82s)]
*  But if you want to fuck around and find out, fuck around and find out. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8953.06s)]
*  So those cases where you're in court and you realize, oh, I'm representing the villain. [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8956.019999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8960.099999999999s)]
*  Does that shift your like without you? [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8960.5s)]
*  You can't help it. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8963.619999999999s)]
*  It just like affects the way you. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8964.26s)]
*  Not at all. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8965.38s)]
*  Not at all. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8966.42s)]
*  Because yeah, I'm wondering. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8966.9s)]
*  It's not how it works for me. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8967.779999999999s)]
*  Like, like I look at it as a it's a it's a legal issue. [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8969.06s)]
*  It's a puzzle. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8972.82s)]
*  It's strategy. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8973.46s)]
*  Like, just like I think if a if a doctor, you know, is operating on a patient and he [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8974.98s)]
*  finds out that patient is a horrible person in real life, it's like, right. [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8980.18s)]
*  But I'm I'm looking at this as like plumbing. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8983.7s)]
*  I'm looking at this as like, this is a problem I'm trained to fix. [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8986.26s)]
*  Like I, I have a God given talent. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8989.7s)]
*  Like, I don't know how it came about, but like I see seven moves ahead in a courtroom. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8993.460000000001s)]
*  Like half the time, I don't even know why I'm making an argument I'm making. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=8997.460000000001s)]
*  And then when I think about it, I go, oh, I did that. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9001.3s)]
*  So they would do this so that then I could do this, that that would make the judge. [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9004.259999999998s)]
*  Like, and I, if I'd consciously, you know, they've been studies on how by the time. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9007.38s)]
*  There's any micro movement from a pitcher that could be observed by the batter. [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9013.619999999999s)]
*  It's too late for them to start the swing, but there's still people hit fastballs. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9020.259999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9026.5s)]
*  So there is some exchange of energy that happens there. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9026.9s)]
*  There's some micro something that can be sensed by a good hitter in baseball. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9029.78s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9035.86s)]
*  Like I have a talent for this that I don't know where it came from. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9036.66s)]
*  I feel blessed to have it. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9041.460000000001s)]
*  I love what I do. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9042.74s)]
*  Like I love to be able to do something that you love and do it at the highest level and [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9044.02s)]
*  do it well is like the greatest gift in the world. [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9048.34s)]
*  But I really, when I'm in a courtroom, like I am way more comfortable in a courtroom than [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9051.300000000001s)]
*  I am in my living room. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9056.980000000001s)]
*  I have no idea what to do with myself in my living room. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9058.18s)]
*  I have no idea. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9060.5s)]
*  I'm one of those people that like I'm great in war and terrible in peace. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9061.300000000001s)]
*  I have no idea what to do with myself, but in a courtroom, I know the rules. [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9065.62s)]
*  I know exactly what to do. [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9070.26s)]
*  And I go in and I am so calm and cool. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9071.94s)]
*  It's like, it's like Neo in the matrix. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9074.42s)]
*  Everything slows down and I just know exactly what's expected of me. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9076.18s)]
*  And I don't know where that comes from, but that's what happens is I no longer. [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9080.18s)]
*  I'm thinking about this person or that person. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9084.9s)]
*  I'm thinking about the job that needs to be done and how to do it. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9088.42s)]
*  And that's it. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9091.3s)]
*  Flow state. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9091.94s)]
*  I want to ask lastly, just how religion plays a role. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9092.82s)]
*  I know you mentioned this guy talked to God, shout out to him, but like something like [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9095.38s)]
*  an arranged marriage and Hinduism or like, you know, Christian fundamentalism is like [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9098.58s)]
*  Islam has different rules on marriage. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9103.78s)]
*  How does that play in as it intersects with American culture? [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9105.46s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it comes in a lot. [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9108.42s)]
*  The divorce rate among cultures where there's a lot of arranged marriage is actually [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9109.619999999999s)]
*  quite low because the, I, and I think that that can be attributed to the fact that people [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9114.58s)]
*  enter into marriage with a different expectation. [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9119.22s)]
*  Like in a lot of cultures where, you know, particularly Muslim cultures, I've had some [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9121.86s)]
*  experience with where individuals marry and there's an arranged marriage that's arranged [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9126.42s)]
*  by the parents. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9130.9s)]
*  It's really done with the sense that marriage is about a family, a partnership, building [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9132.42s)]
*  something together. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9137.14s)]
*  It's not this overly romanticized. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9138.18s)]
*  The idea is that we will grow to love each other and love, you know, love is [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9139.94s)]
*  a feeling, but love is a verb too. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9144.42s)]
*  Like to love someone is to act with love towards that person. [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9147.22s)]
*  So like there are plenty of examples of people who were in arranged marriages or marriages that [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9150.58s)]
*  they weren't quite sure. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9155.7s)]
*  And then they grew to through shared experience and common, like loving children together, [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9156.66s)]
*  they grew to say, you know, this is how it is. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9161.78s)]
*  Like I, so I think that the religion and people's religious backgrounds plays a huge role in how [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9163.86s)]
*  they approach the world and how we approach the world obviously informs how we do our [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9169.86s)]
*  marriage. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9174.18s)]
*  I mean, I will say as someone who was raised very strict Catholic, you know, my Catholicism [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9174.58s)]
*  and my like sort of understanding of the rigidity of the mass and when you stand and when you [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9180.82s)]
*  sit and how you address it, it's very much was good practice for the courtroom. [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9185.300000000001s)]
*  Like, because courtrooms very much the same, like there's people you treat a different way. [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9188.900000000001s)]
*  There's someone who's in charge. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9192.26s)]
*  There's, you know, there's like a hierarchy and you humble yourself before that hierarchy [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9193.54s)]
*  and you're not like bowing and genuflecting is not something that's a source of shame. [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9199.06s)]
*  It's a source of pride. [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9203.46s)]
*  It's like I'm, I'm strong enough to humble myself in front of someone. [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9204.74s)]
*  So I think that religion at its best infuses every aspect of a person's life. [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9208.18s)]
*  And so I've seen some couples that are very religious. [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9214.1s)]
*  What is, what is hard to watch? [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9217.06s)]
*  And I've done a lot of divorces where people have the same religious faith and then one of [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9219.859999999999s)]
*  them loses that faith. [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9225.06s)]
*  And it creates a schism in the relationship that is very hard to fix because religion [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9227.38s)]
*  has certain first principles from which people are working, you know? [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9234.58s)]
*  And so if you lose those foundational first principles, they tether so many other things [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9238.18s)]
*  in the marriage, like that it gets really, really tricky, you know? [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9244.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9247.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9248.34s)]
*  Man, that's kind of sad to lose your partner and your faith. [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9249.38s)]
*  Fuck. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9254.26s)]
*  Yeah. But sometimes again, to throw the counterpoint, I've done a lot of divorces, [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9255.06s)]
*  for example, in the Hasidic community and the ultra-orthodox Jewish community. [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9260.5s)]
*  And that is a community. [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9264.98s)]
*  I don't think I'm giving anything away when I say that if you could choose between being [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9266.42s)]
*  a man in that community or a woman in that community, you're better off being a man. [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9269.38s)]
*  Like women aren't allowed to drive. [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9273.46s)]
*  Women aren't allowed. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9275.14s)]
*  There's a lot of rules imposed on women that are challenging. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9275.699999999999s)]
*  It's a fairly admittedly patriarchal society, society, culture, you know, [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9279.14s)]
*  enclave. And so sometimes those women will say like, yeah, I can't do this anymore. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9285.06s)]
*  Like, I don't want to be in this game anymore. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9291.3s)]
*  I want to step out of this. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9293.779999999999s)]
*  And that's very challenging. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9296.02s)]
*  It's very, very challenging because it is very, very difficult to reconcile [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9297.22s)]
*  an ultra-orthodox religious life and someone who goes fully in the other. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9302.26s)]
*  Because people like, moderation doesn't play into it. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9308.42s)]
*  People treat dandruff with decapitation. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9311.859999999999s)]
*  Like there becomes like people go from I'm ultra religious to fuck that. [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9314.02s)]
*  I'm as far from religious as you can be. [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9320.26s)]
*  Like you ever want to meet somebody who's a virulent atheist? [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9322.98s)]
*  Find someone who was raised super religious. [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9326.66s)]
*  It's like people go in that opposite direction. [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9329.54s)]
*  And it's, yeah, it's challenging, but it also sometimes is, you know, [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9331.78s)]
*  we all change as time moves on. [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9336.74s)]
*  And that's the challenge, I think, is being honest with yourself about what's changed [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9339.46s)]
*  and then being able to be honest with your partner. [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9344.099999999999s)]
*  I will tell you, doing what I do for a living, one of the things I've learned [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9345.699999999999s)]
*  is the most dangerous lies are the ones we tell ourselves. [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9348.9s)]
*  And most of the time when we lie to our partner, we're lying to ourself [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9351.939999999999s)]
*  and then we're lying to our partner. [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9355.46s)]
*  And so I just, that's why I'm always a fan of the honest conversation. [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9357.3s)]
*  Like just be honest, be frank, be candid, just say the quiet part out loud. [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9361.3s)]
*  Like, and I think that's why to some degree, like, and I'm not saying this to be [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9365.779999999999s)]
*  I'm not trying to have your wives not be mad at me, although it would be good to [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9369.699999999999s)]
*  have them not be mad at me or you. [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9373.779999999999s)]
*  I think one of the things I've found about comics, I've represented a couple of comics, [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9376.179999999998s)]
*  there is something really naked and honest about getting up in front of people and talking about [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9382.099999999999s)]
*  your most vulnerable, embarrassing, dumb shit. [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9387.14s)]
*  It's also the funniest shit. [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9389.939999999999s)]
*  It's the shit people can relate to. [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9391.3s)]
*  But you use that muscle all the time. [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9393.14s)]
*  So I imagine in relationship, you do the same thing. [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9396.419999999998s)]
*  And that's probably why, like there are like, I know a lot of comics that are incredibly [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9399.619999999999s)]
*  happily married. [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9405.06s)]
*  I know some that never marry because the lifestyle on the road and things like that, [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9406.019999999999s)]
*  substance use issues, stuff like that. [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9409.38s)]
*  But I know a lot of comics that are very, very happily married because that same [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9411.22s)]
*  self-effacing insight and an open, unashamed, like calling out their own bullshit [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9415.939999999999s)]
*  serves people pretty well in a relationship. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9423.699999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9426.339999999998s)]
*  Before we leave. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9426.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9427.46s)]
*  Is there anything that you've learned through all these divorces about what makes [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9429.14s)]
*  marriages successful? [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9433.38s)]
*  I wrote a whole book on that. [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9435.14s)]
*  Can you give us like, just so we end on a nice positive note, what are some things that [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9436.9s)]
*  you've felt? [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9441.699999999999s)]
*  I think you can learn a lot about keeping things together by watching how they fall apart. [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9442.419999999998s)]
*  And that's why I wrote the book. [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9446.98s)]
*  What's the name of the book? [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9449.46s)]
*  It's called How to Stay in Love, Practical Wisdom from an Unlikely Source. [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9453.22s)]
*  And you can get it on like Audible if you want to listen to me talk for eight and a half hours. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9457.46s)]
*  Or you can just get it anywhere. [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9462.179999999998s)]
*  It's for sale anywhere. [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9463.539999999999s)]
*  And, you know, I've learned a lot by being a divorce lawyer about what keeps people together. [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9465.699999999999s)]
*  What I've learned, I would say more than anything else is just pay attention. [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9470.339999999998s)]
*  Just pay attention. [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9474.099999999999s)]
*  Like people get divorced the same way they go bankrupt, very slowly and then all at once. [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9475.22s)]
*  Like you don't get divorced because your husband's cheating on you, your wife's cheating on you. [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9482.259999999998s)]
*  Your husband's cheating on you, your wife's cheating on you because there was slippage. [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9487.619999999999s)]
*  There were all these little things like, you know, those little things you did when you first were [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9491.3s)]
*  dating your wife to like let her know how beautiful she was and how like you like her better than other [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9495.859999999999s)]
*  options and all those little things she did for you that like made you feel like the fucking [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9502.019999999999s)]
*  coolest guy and the best guy. [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9507.619999999999s)]
*  Like, you loved who you were when you're with her. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9509.46s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9512.74s)]
*  You know, like you stood taller. [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9513.619999999999s)]
*  You went like, yeah, I might be the person this person thinks I am, you know? [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9516.42s)]
*  When we start losing that, like there are these little things like the advice I give, [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9523.060000000001s)]
*  one of the pieces of advice I give in my book, the one that I get the most feedback on, [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9528.980000000001s)]
*  as I said, leave a note. [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9532.5s)]
*  Just leave your wife a note. [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9534.58s)]
*  Whatever, every day when you leave the house, just takes 30 seconds. [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9536.66s)]
*  Just like, babe, like it was so fun watching that movie with you last night. [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9540.02s)]
*  Like, I married the prettiest girl in the world. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9543.78s)]
*  Can't wait to see you later. [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9546.5s)]
*  Like, what does it take? [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9547.94s)]
*  30 seconds? [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9548.66s)]
*  What is that doing though? [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9550.980000000001s)]
*  It's saying I still see you. [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9552.42s)]
*  I still think you're beautiful. [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9554.42s)]
*  You're still worth my time. [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9556.18s)]
*  You're still worth my attention. [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9557.78s)]
*  There's all these other things going on in the world. [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9559.54s)]
*  There's the kids. [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9561.7s)]
*  There's a million things, the thousand natural shocks that flesh is there too, right? [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9562.5s)]
*  But you're still, it's still you and me. [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9566.34s)]
*  Still you and me. [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9569.140000000001s)]
*  Like, and those little things, just pay attention. [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9570.26s)]
*  Pay attention and don't let slippage happen. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9573.3s)]
*  Because it is, look, it is so much easier to stay a healthy weight [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9576.019999999999s)]
*  than it is to get super fucking fat and try to lose a hundred pounds. [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9580.82s)]
*  So it's the same thing. [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9584.66s)]
*  Once the wheels come off this thing, it is really hard to get back there. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9585.779999999999s)]
*  So just, if you care about this person and you care about the value of that marriage, [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9590.019999999999s)]
*  just take that little bit of time to just, again, it can be just a kind word. [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9595.619999999999s)]
*  It can just be building this person up when people around [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9600.66s)]
*  instead of taking the piss out of them around people. [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9603.78s)]
*  Like it can be anything. [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9606.26s)]
*  It can be any little gestures, but those are the things that make us fall in love. [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9607.46s)]
*  Those are the things that make us stay in love. [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9611.22s)]
*  And when you let those little things slip, that's when the wheels start coming off. [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9613.619999999999s)]
*  And that's, there's a short road from that to my office. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9618.1s)]
*  So I always just tell people pay attention [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9621.14s)]
*  and just make a point of cheering for the person that you're with. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9624.1s)]
*  That's it. [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9627.22s)]
*  Amen to that. [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9627.619999999999s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9628.34s)]
*  Awesome. [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmrHBHJTVZ4&t=9629.06s)]
