# Debate ROAST: REAL Reason Biden is Running & Taylor Swift Truth Exposed
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [July 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg)
*  America. Last week we witnessed a one-of-a-kind event. A felon destroyed a government official. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=0.0s)]
*  No, not that one. I'm talking about the debate. Trump did something we've never seen before. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  He took down a vegetable and Sleepy Joe proved he's the modern day JFK because his fucking [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=11.6s)]
*  brain was all over the place. Listen, Kamala may be the Jamaican one, but Biden looked [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=16.98s)]
*  like he had a blood clot if you ask me. He got more drool on that podium than the hot [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=21.64s)]
*  to a girl with a sinus infection. Now, the question everyone's asking is who won the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=26.28s)]
*  debate and it depends. Sorry. Depends. You know, the adult diapers that allowed these [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=32.08s)]
*  two metamucil monkeys to talk for 90 minutes without a piss break. I mean, Trump's bladder [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=38.160000000000004s)]
*  must have looked like Lizzo's yoga ball. And let's be honest, Biden didn't make it all [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=42.64s)]
*  the way through. His underwear were more soaked than a Dubai strip mall. Trump easily won [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=46.64s)]
*  the debate, which I'm sure he'll never bring up again. Biden's performance was frankly [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=51.66s)]
*  terrifying. Biden took pauses so pregnant, Alabama declared them human life. It was so [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=56.04s)]
*  concerning. Even CNN said he should no longer be running for president. Hey, CNN, he's [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=61.36s)]
*  already the fucking president. Why are we all okay with this? This is the most important [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=66.8s)]
*  job in the world. Would you let Biden do any other job? If he was announced CEO of Apple, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=71.76s)]
*  you would sell your shares in a heartbeat. I wouldn't let him run Apple. I wouldn't let [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=77.2s)]
*  him eat a fucking Apple. It's applesauce only for this guy. Okay. What about babysitting? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=80.88s)]
*  You're gonna let Biden babysit? Fuck no. The only person letting Biden babysit is Casey [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=85.8s)]
*  Anthony. So it begs the question, why on earth is Biden still running? Now, is he a maniacal, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=90.16s)]
*  power hungry narcissist? Maybe. Or is he a man of the people? Is it because he's the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=96.24s)]
*  last line of defense against the bigger threat to our country? No, not Trump. A woman who [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=102.6s)]
*  has the charm of a general wart and the cackle that would make Van Gogh sew his ear back [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=109.0s)]
*  on just to cut it off again. The wicked witch of the West Indies, Kamala Harris. Sure, Biden [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=113.92s)]
*  has the plane on autopilot, but at least we don't have Kamala Akbar in a cockpit. So here [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=119.76s)]
*  we are, America, the greatest reality show in history. Sit back, relax and enjoy. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=124.76s)]
*  What's up, everybody? Welcome to Flay Grange. Obviously, we got to talk about this debate, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=131.68s)]
*  man. Did everybody see the debate? Yes. Sadly. I saw the important part. Why'd you cook Kamala [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=136.56s)]
*  like that? I had a good one for Carla that wasn't in there, but she's Jamaican and Indian, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=141.32s)]
*  so she makes her own wigs. But I do think that Kamala's job security, and I wonder if [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=152.32s)]
*  they do this shit on purpose. Sometimes we assume that these political parties are idiots, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=159.6s)]
*  right? We see a lot of the politicians are like, yeah, they're fucking retards. They [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=167.51999999999998s)]
*  don't know what the hell they're talking about. They make mistakes all the time. They're bumbling. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=171.0s)]
*  But is it job security to give Joe Biden the most unlikable VP so that he never has to worry about [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=174.28s)]
*  his job? Because if Gavin Newsom, now I know people hate Gavin Newsom, like everybody in LA [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=183.32s)]
*  and all these other motherfuckers hate him, but there are people that love him. He would probably [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=188.68s)]
*  win. And he looks like a politician. If he was Biden's VP, I think they're yanking Biden. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=191.88s)]
*  That's a good point. Because they probably choose someone who can get a swath of votes. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=197.96s)]
*  That's the other thing. But also they don't want... What's that QB2 thing that we were talking about? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=201.72s)]
*  Oh yeah, you don't want to back up quarterback. It was Cam Newton, who's too good to where if the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=207.72s)]
*  team starts losing, all of a sudden the press is going, hey, put in Cam, whatever. So you kind of [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=218.35999999999999s)]
*  want to back up quarterback that's not going to challenge for that position at all. Which is part [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=222.92s)]
*  of why Kaepernick didn't get signed. Because it's like, if you're struggling and he comes in, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=227.48s)]
*  theoretically wins three games in a row, we've got a whole quarterback controversy. So I bet a lot of [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=232.28s)]
*  starting quarterbacks were not lobbying for Colin Kaepernick in their backup. I wonder if they [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=237.07999999999998s)]
*  actually manipulate the media to make Kamala less likable. I mean, she does a good job of helping [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=241.32s)]
*  him. Well, she doesn't do anything. I haven't heard anything about anything she's done except [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=246.92s)]
*  her laughing. I think they muzzle her. Because she was... I think we were ready to like her, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=250.52s)]
*  but she just fumbled it somehow. Just said a few things we didn't like and then we're like, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=257.32s)]
*  now we're done. We're good. I think we're saying this on different app, but like a Jamaican and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=260.68s)]
*  an Indian with no opinions. Yeah, you've never seen it before. I don't believe this. Yeah, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=263.8s)]
*  they've canceled each other out. Yeah. Okay. So you guys solve the debate or what? Yes. Okay, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=267.56s)]
*  thoughts? I mean, it was a fucking nightmare. It was an abject nightmare. I will say on the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=271.88s)]
*  positive side. Trump bodied him, but also just like, he's saying a lot of wild shit too. What [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=276.44s)]
*  is it like the pro-abortion ruling or the anti-abortion ruling? Everybody wanted it. It's like, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=282.6s)]
*  I don't think so. If I'm Republican moderate, I'm looking at that like, no, that's why we didn't [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=287.0s)]
*  destroy in the midterms. Yeah. Because we passed that fucking the Supreme Court overturned vote. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=291.64s)]
*  Yeah. It's a performance and it's what you say and how you say Trump lied, Biden couldn't speak. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=295.88s)]
*  What did Trump lie about? Bro, if you... Yo, I saw your tweet and I was so frustrated by it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=304.52000000000004s)]
*  I mean, you're just saying everything he did is the best. Everything he lied about. Oh, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=310.36s)]
*  every expert is saying what I did is the best. Just that everybody was in favor of the ruling. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=313.40000000000003s)]
*  I'm not saying he did it live, but I'm saying what did he lie about? Please just pull it up. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=315.8s)]
*  It's almost every time he opened his mouth. Because I thought that the Democrats did that [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=320.44s)]
*  beautifully. They were like, all right, we fucked this one up, Biden shit the bed, but we need to [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=324.04s)]
*  position Trump in a way. And Biden essentially was like, yo, I didn't do good, but at least I [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=329.88s)]
*  told the truth. So now Trump is this liar. But I bet Biden lied too. Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=334.84s)]
*  We expect politicians to lie. So it's not that... That's the thing. This is a job interview. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=339.56s)]
*  I think the amount of lying was so far past the point. There always are fact checking on debates. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=343.88s)]
*  There's always fact checking. I think the amount of... If he said one thing, he could have done [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=349.0s)]
*  better or one thing he would do differently. Everything he did was the best. He was just [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=353.0s)]
*  doing feelings, no facts. That's all. That's what he did. Which is fair, but it ain't. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=356.92s)]
*  It's fun. It's a fun part of the pot. It's a fun part of the debate. Do you want to hear some [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=361.0s)]
*  feelings, no facts? He said that... Facts, no feelings or feelings, no facts? This is feelings, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=364.28000000000003s)]
*  no facts. Trump said that everybody wanted Roe vs. Wade overturned. Trump claims... Again, this is [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=367.64000000000004s)]
*  from CNN. People were upset at me about that post, about the abortion post I put up. I thought that [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=372.52000000000004s)]
*  was a very reasonable question. Me too. Nine months? I asked for everybody who hasn't seen it. I just [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=377.0s)]
*  posted on my Instagram. I was like, yo... Because there was a discussion in the debate where Biden [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=381.72s)]
*  and Trump were talking about abortions at nine months. Biden wouldn't give a declarative answer [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=387.24s)]
*  about how it's wrong. He was being a little loosey-goosey on it. Trump was like... Because [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=393.24s)]
*  he doesn't have to answer that ridiculous statement because no one has ever... I hate that. I hate [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=397.72s)]
*  when they do this. No, see, he couldn't do it. I hate when they do this. He couldn't do it. No, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=402.28000000000003s)]
*  you're gay. No, you're being gay. I am. I am. I am. But still... Wait, wait, wait, wait. He's [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=405.72s)]
*  being gay. He's going to represent. He's going to do that gay shit. He got some scoops. It's July, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=411.48s)]
*  son. Cut that shit. You had your month. So he'll answer questions about golf. He'll challenge [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=416.12s)]
*  those. But when Trump is like, they're aborting babies at nine months, Biden doesn't have to [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=422.76000000000005s)]
*  acknowledge that? No. The golf thing, I got it. No. You got to talk about your handicaps. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=427.56s)]
*  So, check it. Mark had a good point about this. And he said that it was so much like the gun laws [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=431.0s)]
*  where Democrats would be like, why do you need a rocket launcher? And Republican politicians [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=440.84000000000003s)]
*  don't want to say, yeah, we don't need rocket launchers. We should outlaw rocket launchers [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=445.8s)]
*  because they feel that their constituents will be upset about it. So Biden's lack of an answer, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=450.28000000000003s)]
*  the fact that he couldn't just be like, yo, yeah, taking a baby out there at nine months for no [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=456.76s)]
*  fucking reason is, yeah, you're killing a baby. The fact he couldn't just say that straight up [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=460.84s)]
*  is the reason why I posted it. I was like, wait, is this even a discussion? I thought everybody's [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=465.32s)]
*  on the same page. But I think that's more of a fumble than it is him avoiding answering the [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=469.08s)]
*  question or responding to it. Like it was really a fumble because in the past he has vocally said [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=473.8s)]
*  like, no, that's ridiculous. Okay, that's fair. One fucking senator said some stupid comment [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=479.4s)]
*  and they were being a Virginia dude. Yeah. And he was being like, what's it called? Hyperbolic. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=484.44s)]
*  And you don't be hyperbolic about abortion. And with that shit, as if all Democrats want [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=489.88s)]
*  abortion. Okay, so people are upset in the comments. And it was really funny comment section [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=494.36s)]
*  because half the people were like, yeah, that's crazy to do that. And I'm looking at those comments [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=497.8s)]
*  like, all right, yeah, those are same people. And then other people are like, you're a fucking [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=501.88s)]
*  monster for even posting this. You're a man. You don't have a right to say that. I'll be honest, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=506.2s)]
*  I spoke to a few people. And we know at least one of them. And they said, up to any point in time, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=509.72s)]
*  they think it's okay to do. And it's their body. Not me. And then it's a it was Paxil. And then [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=517.0s)]
*  it's a parasite. And like, it's a parasite until it comes out of me. Now. That's what they said. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=524.0400000000001s)]
*  And I tried to just ask questions like, you're not going to change my mind about this at all. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=532.44s)]
*  You know, the only time is if it's the life of the mother. That's what I said. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=536.1999999999999s)]
*  But here's what lazy. Yeah, you're lazy. You had time. Yeah, don't give me that shit. You had time. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=543.16s)]
*  You procrastinated. We all procrastinate. It happens. But you paid a price. If you look at [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=549.3199999999999s)]
*  this as a parasite for eight months. Why are you waiting? Yeah, who'd have a worm in them for eight [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=554.4399999999999s)]
*  months? Yeah. Carry around extra 30 pounds. Shut up. Okay, how long was that worm in his brain? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=558.52s)]
*  Gotta get that worm aboard. He really does. He could do better than them in the debates with [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=563.4s)]
*  the R.F.K. won that debate. Yeah, yeah. He might have won that debate. They did the right thing [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=568.76s)]
*  by not having there because America would be in disarray right now. Yeah. I mean, America would [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=574.6800000000001s)]
*  literally be going I'm voting for the worm brain guy. Yeah. What the fuck is happening in this [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=579.8s)]
*  country? We're the best possible candidate just admitted that a worm ate their brain. Yeah. Yeah, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=583.32s)]
*  that's where we are. That's what I'm asking myself. Where are we? Yeah. Yeah. Here's a theory I've [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=590.76s)]
*  heard that the Democrats- About abortion or Democrats? No. Which you want to stay on abortion? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=595.32s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Here's the abortion thing is there's a weird disconnect or whatever cognitive [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=599.0s)]
*  dissonance where you don't want to admit at a certain point is taking a life because that [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=603.0s)]
*  allows you to be okay with it. My general feeling and this is again, I don't know, probably upset [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=606.44s)]
*  both sides. You are at once it has a heartbeat, that's a life. I don't know how it's not a life. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=610.28s)]
*  Definitionally, you're taking a life. If you decide I'd rather take the life now than have him live [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=614.0400000000001s)]
*  an entire life or her where he's unwanted, I can respect that decision. But the idea that it's not [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=618.6s)]
*  taking a life is crazy. It's as crazy as a fucking zygote at a what do you call it? IVF farm is a [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=624.04s)]
*  life. That's not a life. This is like you guys are both being crazy. Yeah. Neil Brennan said to me, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=633.0s)]
*  it's kind of killing kind of a life. And he's like, that's why it's so hard because it's not [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=637.72s)]
*  really killing but it's not really it's what is it? And so now no one has an answer. Fair enough. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=642.6s)]
*  But the funniest thing from Biden on that nine months. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=646.92s)]
*  That's what we even talk murder. What's he kicking for? I think he kicks back, bro. You [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=650.4399999999999s)]
*  are engaging with the kid. The kid is in there pounding you out. Yeah. You're killing something. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=655.24s)]
*  But the kids kicking a woman. You know what I mean? What do we do with woman kickers? Oh, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=660.8399999999999s)]
*  we got to take them out, dude. That's what happens if you're kicking a woman for nine months. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=664.12s)]
*  You might get put down. You think that they deserved it? Is that some of them? You think [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=667.9599999999999s)]
*  somebody's deserved it? If they kick hard, you can intro Kendrick on a concert. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=671.24s)]
*  So I'm saying. Or you could, you know, if they're good at football, you just cut them for half a [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=677.8s)]
*  season, bring them back later. You know what I mean? Yeah, it doesn't matter. But the funny thing is [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=680.84s)]
*  they asked Biden the easiest question Roe versus Wade. What are you going to do? And Trump was [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=685.48s)]
*  like, everyone wanted it. And everyone's like, oh, fuck. And they asked Biden, he was like, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=689.96s)]
*  I want Roe versus Wade. We had an immigrant that raped a woman. And everyone's like, what the fuck [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=693.4s)]
*  are you talking about? That was his biggest fumble. Why did you bring that up? Yeah, I know. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=698.76s)]
*  Why are we so comfortable with all the fumbles, Hill? Like he's the president. He's not our [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=701.88s)]
*  grandpa. I think it's an important distinction we got to start making. Like we're allowing him [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=706.92s)]
*  to make the gaffes. We kind of laugh at the gaffes and it's like, no, no, no, no, no. The job, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=711.4s)]
*  you don't have gaffes. Well, this is the theory I was going to bring up. There's a theory that, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=715.24s)]
*  because the debates normally start in September. There's a theory that Democrats pushed to have it [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=718.52s)]
*  in June. So Biden could kind of expose himself and they could swap him out. And then everybody [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=722.1999999999999s)]
*  be like, yeah, this needed to happen. Yeah. But what's so funny about that theory is like, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=727.08s)]
*  he's already been exposed himself. Nobody just found out that he's retarded now. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=729.88s)]
*  But now we really saw it. Now we really saw it. But I think they were all just like remembering [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=734.36s)]
*  past debates and was like, ah, maybe. I thought he was too old in 2020. And he did great in those [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=739.08s)]
*  debates. They drugged him up or whatever. And I think it's just the pressure of the debate [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=745.1600000000001s)]
*  got to him because the next day he looks pretty good, like doing one of his rallies. But then it's [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=751.0s)]
*  like low pressure. You have a teleprompter. He has a crowd energizing him and shit like that. But [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=757.64s)]
*  that debate, he looked like two different people. Yeah. He cracked under pressure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=763.16s)]
*  It's like, that's just weird. Yeah. Who chokes after they won a championship and they go to repeat. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=768.2s)]
*  That's what I'm like in the middle. Cause I'm like, I know he's doing these gaps now, but [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=774.36s)]
*  he's doing pretty good job in the presidential role. So I'm like, yeah, here's the thing. Here's the [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=777.96s)]
*  thing. I think deep down, none of us believe he's making any decisions. That's that. Yes. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=783.16s)]
*  Here's the thing. Here's the thing. Okay. So, so you're cool with it. That is cool. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=790.2s)]
*  But you also have to empathize with people who are like, I'm voting for a person, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=794.2s)]
*  not the handlers. Yeah. So if the person isn't making decisions, my vote is not represented. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=799.24s)]
*  Now we don't have a democracy. But I saw what that person did the last four and shit was crazy. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=804.28s)]
*  I'm not saying vote for Trump. What I'm saying is if somebody voted for Biden, if they were like, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=809.3199999999999s)]
*  I really like your ideas and I like what you're doing. And then they find out he's not making [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=813.24s)]
*  the decisions. You can understand how they might be feeling a little disillusioned. So we have this [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=816.92s)]
*  weird thing that's happening where it's become normalized to believe that our president is not [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=822.4399999999999s)]
*  all there and other people are making decisions and nobody can point to the other people. Because [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=828.68s)]
*  you just want to justify your sides. But then those people are very anti-Trump. Why are you [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=832.52s)]
*  anti-Trump if you just don't like that one individual? It says like, again, you just justify [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=836.4399999999999s)]
*  your side. So, hey, it doesn't matter what the individual does. You're voting for the people [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=840.28s)]
*  behind the individual. Those guys are going to let things not get too crazy. But then Trump [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=844.68s)]
*  specifically is dangerous. How is Trump specifically dangerous if it's just going to be the handlers? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=848.76s)]
*  No, no, no, not you. Those people who are like, oh, it doesn't matter. Biden's just getting [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=853.8s)]
*  handled anyway. They'll look at Trump and be like, well, no, you can't let that individual [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=857.48s)]
*  have the White House. I see what you're saying. There's like a logical flaw. I see the cognitive [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=861.24s)]
*  disincentive there. It's like they. But what I would say in that situation is when I look at Biden, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=865.56s)]
*  I'm like, he needs to be handled. When I look at Trump, he will never let anybody handle him. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=870.4399999999999s)]
*  OK, that's fair. And I think that's their concern. And I think that's also like the party system [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=875.16s)]
*  concern, too. I don't think the Democratic operation is going to be that upset if they [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=879.4s)]
*  have like a traditional Republican comment, right? Because they know they can kind of control them. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=885.4s)]
*  And by them, I don't think the Democrats, I mean like the fucking Boeing and pharmaceutical [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=889.64s)]
*  companies and all the people who butter the bread. I think they're like, yeah, we can work. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=893.96s)]
*  I think they look at Trump and they're like, yeah, this guy, he's going to do whatever the [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=897.72s)]
*  fuck he wants. That scares the shit out of people. But that's also what people like. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=901.8s)]
*  If you feel disillusioned by the pharmaceutical industry, by the military industrial complex, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=905.16s)]
*  if you feel disillusioned by every aspect of industry or government, you want the dude who's [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=909.8s)]
*  not going to listen to them. Yeah, that's fair. That's the debate. Do you want a crazy guy that'll [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=914.28s)]
*  do whatever he wants or a crazy guy that can't do anything he wants? Low key, I think they want a [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=917.72s)]
*  crazy guy that will do the opposite of what those old establishment industries will do. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=921.1600000000001s)]
*  Who are you speaking for? Trump. Supports. Okay. And I think they're like, I just want somebody [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=927.24s)]
*  to point a finger at those people that have fucked me over. They believe that they've been fucked over. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=932.2s)]
*  Which I completely empathize with. Hell yeah. Those guys get fucked at every turn. We kind of [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=936.0400000000001s)]
*  scoff at them, laugh at middle America, fly over states, blah, blah, blah. Of course they resent [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=940.9200000000001s)]
*  the establishment and the coastal cities and all that. We've done nothing but look down on them [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=945.08s)]
*  and not help them. So fuck you. At least give me the guy who says fuck you back on my behalf. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=948.76s)]
*  They don't feel a way that during the first four years he didn't really drain the swamp and get [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=952.6s)]
*  rid of these motherfuckers or do anything against these institutions. I think he still speaks enough to them [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=957.5600000000001s)]
*  that I would rock with. I think they wouldn't elect him for a third term, but I think he does [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=961.88s)]
*  enough and the other guys haven't done anything for them. So they're like, all right, at least this guy [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=967.5600000000001s)]
*  you just vote for who's closest to your opinions. Like all these religious people voting for Trump, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=972.1999999999999s)]
*  they know damn well this motherfucker ain't religious. He paid for more abortions than [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=975.8s)]
*  anyone in this room except Alex. Stop it, I never pay. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=979.16s)]
*  Big announcements. The last leg of cities for the life tour. San Antonio, Las Vegas, Cleveland, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=988.28s)]
*  Columbus, Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Denver, Cincinnati, Rama, Ontario, Salt Lake City, Reno, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=995.16s)]
*  San Jose, Portland, and Hawaii. Those are the last cities. God bless you. I appreciate you all. I [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1002.76s)]
*  love y'all and I'll see you soon. Peace. All right guys, first of all, I got some shows. I know I'm [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1008.76s)]
*  in Jacksonville at the end of July. I know I'm in Hawaii at the end of August. Those dates and many [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1013.7199999999999s)]
*  more September. We're going to start really kicking it up again. AkashSingh.com. But I want to tell [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1017.4s)]
*  you guys something that I'm very excited about. I am a partial owner of a chai shop. It's chai and [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1021.24s)]
*  natural wines. My brother forever, one of my good friends, Arjun Gupta, married a beautiful Indian [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1028.68s)]
*  woman from Assam where they make the best tea in India quite possibly. And they wanted to make a [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1035.16s)]
*  chai shop. They partnered up with somebody who knows what the fuck he's doing. And it's fantastic [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1039.56s)]
*  chai, fantastic choc, fantastic food. It's desi as fuck. It's called Fontanious. Fontanious. If you [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1043.08s)]
*  want to get a little taste of gold, if you want to get good chai, there's honestly, this is the [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1048.76s)]
*  first great chai in New York. I'm being completely serious. I say that with no disrespect to anybody [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1052.36s)]
*  else, but I just hadn't found great chai until this. It is on 28 J Street in Brooklyn. That's [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1056.76s)]
*  Dumbo. I don't mind Dumbo as much as the rest of Brooklyn because it's still got a nice yuppie [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1061.64s)]
*  touch to it. A nice capitalist touch to it. Guys, get the tickets from at AkashSingh.com. If you're [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1065.4s)]
*  in New York, go to Fontanious in Brooklyn. Now let's get back to the show. Love y'all. So real [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1070.12s)]
*  quick, just post a bit. What do you think happens? Do you think that they yanking them out or what? [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1074.12s)]
*  Dude, I don't think so because I still think he's their best chance to win, which is crazy. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1078.2s)]
*  Okay, Mark. Yeah, they don't pull. What do you think happens? I mean, it goes to an election. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1082.28s)]
*  They do in another debate. And hopefully, I think the debate format is way better for one. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1086.68s)]
*  And I also think that it helped Trump. Yes. Yeah, explain that. Because like, so the first debate, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1091.96s)]
*  2016, when he's coming out, the crowd helped Trump immensely. He was like getting charged up. He was [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1099.48s)]
*  able to play the crowd better than everyone. And that I think is what got him elected is the [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1103.96s)]
*  rallies was the debates, like all those quotes. And then 2020, that debate, he tried doing the [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1107.4s)]
*  same thing, but he looked like such a bully. He got like high off the crowd's energy, and then [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1111.64s)]
*  started like pummeling Biden. Everyone was like, what's wrong with this guy? He's like out of [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1115.16s)]
*  control. He's a loose cannon. And then this time, no audience. It was just the people. And then it [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1119.3200000000002s)]
*  was just him. He was very calm. I feel like he was like very controlled. Biden was losing the time [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1123.48s)]
*  limit all the time. And then Trump, I thought, the way better partially because of that reason. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1127.72s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with you 100%. I think also that the time limit, the time limit actually helps Trump. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1131.48s)]
*  Yeah. Because short. He'll run the light. Trump will run the light. And if you're the Dems, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1139.0800000000002s)]
*  if you're Biden, you want him running the light because once he gets through the thing that he's [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1143.96s)]
*  memorized to say, and he starts freestyling, that's when we like it. That's the crazy thing. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1148.2s)]
*  That's when he starts cooking. Like once the hands get out there, once his hands do this, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1152.3600000000001s)]
*  he forgot everything he had to say. I'm sitting there. I'm perched up in my seat. I'm like, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1157.0s)]
*  oh, he's about to cook right now. Let's fucking go. But they chop him off at the minute. So he [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1164.36s)]
*  doesn't have a lot of hands time. Whereas, you know, Biden, maybe, maybe it would have been a [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1168.9199999999998s)]
*  little bit. I would let that guy run. If I'm Biden, I would just let him run. Also, you can't give [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1173.08s)]
*  Biden numbers. Stop giving him numbers. Every number is a fumble. He can't get past it. He just [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1177.8799999999999s)]
*  can't do it. Keep it vague. Like your memory. I do want them to bring back. They used to have the [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1182.44s)]
*  little ticker thing that showed like, it was kind of like a fact checker live. And they had that [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1187.0s)]
*  last time. And I do think they should bring it back because it was so ridiculous. And that, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1192.3600000000001s)]
*  it has to be a little truthful because why would you vote for somebody that every single word out [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1198.3600000000001s)]
*  of his mouth is a lot? It's like, you're either voting for him. But we don't know everything. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1202.76s)]
*  It's a brain dead or voting for a lot. I'm falling for every single narrative. I fell for the [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1205.96s)]
*  narrative that Biden said everything that was true that whole night. He didn't say one single [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1210.68s)]
*  lie. Then I go on Twitter and then people are listening to all the lies. I fell for the narrative [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1214.3600000000001s)]
*  that Trump lied about every single thing. And then I go on Twitter and I'm like, oh shit, he did say [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1218.04s)]
*  something truthful in these months. So I'm falling for every narrative left and right. I hate [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1222.3600000000001s)]
*  information right now. I'm almost at the point where I'm like, if you say something is I believe [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1226.2s)]
*  it. So you better say more interesting lies than that motherfucker. Because he got me with his lies. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1229.96s)]
*  But I'm like, good. I wonder if it's always been that way. I want to see a fact check on like a [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1234.76s)]
*  debate from the 60s. That's the thing Charlemagne always quotes. Nobody believes the truth on the [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1237.8s)]
*  lies more interesting. Yeah. And I think it's always been that way. I just expect politicians [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1240.84s)]
*  to lie. Just to have the fact checker during the debates. I used to like that. Bro, did you see [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1244.36s)]
*  the clip of Reagan during his debate acknowledge his age? No. This was fucking, this was fire. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1249.0s)]
*  The guy asking the questions asks him, how do you feel about the sentiment that you're maybe [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1261.0s)]
*  too old or your age or something like that? I don't want to butcher it. Maybe you bring it up. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1267.0s)]
*  But he essentially says something to the extent of he goes, I don't want, he goes, I want to win [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1272.2s)]
*  this fair and square. I don't want to have discussions in this debate about my opponent's [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1278.52s)]
*  youth and inexperience. Like he flips the age thing on to the point where the guy that he's [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1283.64s)]
*  going up against starts laughing. Yeah. And he even like looks over and he's kind of like, he's like, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1289.0s)]
*  oh, that guy's likable. And I looked at that guy laugh at his opponent. Sorry. I look and I go, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1293.48s)]
*  you're toast. You are fucking toast. Like he charmed his opponent. Yeah. I mean, I think there's [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1298.76s)]
*  this, we have this version of like Reagan, what is it? Reaganomics or whatever like that. I think [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1305.24s)]
*  the Democrats have really kind of maybe for good reasons or bad reasons. I don't really know, but [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1310.2s)]
*  you grow up in like a Democrat city where like, oh, Reaganomics was horrible and this was disgusting [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1315.88s)]
*  and this, and he gave, it was him that gave crack to the hood and all this other stuff. And I had [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1319.88s)]
*  this idea of him as this like horrible person that just like destroyed urban communities and [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1324.0400000000002s)]
*  destroyed the economy. But every time I see this guy talking to me, I'm like, is this the best [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1328.44s)]
*  president ever? He was quick on his feet. That was so quick. That one, the assassination attempt. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1333.48s)]
*  He gets, if someone tries to kill him, he survives and then add a speech, all of a sudden a balloon [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1340.2s)]
*  pops and he stops the speech, goes, miss me. And then keeps going. I mean, he's there Clinton, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1345.08s)]
*  like just a charm. He flipped entire states, I think. The Republicans have painted Clinton in a way [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1351.72s)]
*  in the same way that the Democrats have painted Reagan in a way, but he probably really satisfied [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1359.6399999999999s)]
*  the things that they wanted emotionally while at the same time was incredibly charming. I mean, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1364.28s)]
*  he charms the guy that he's going up against to the point where he's looking over and laughing [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1368.4399999999998s)]
*  and he doesn't even realize he just drowned his opponent before it even started. That guy wants [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1373.08s)]
*  to vote for Reagan. Yeah. And everybody seeing it is like, oh, that guy's, that guy's, how am I [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1378.12s)]
*  going to vote for the guy that got, that laughed at the other guy? No, I'm voting for the guy that [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1382.92s)]
*  got the laugh. My opponent's youth and inexperience. Wow. What a fucking dude. He was war ready. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1386.6s)]
*  Yeah. Speaking of age. I'm not going to attack his age and then I'm just going to attack his age. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1394.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1397.56s)]
*  Speaking of elders, Trump, I'm sorry, Bill Clinton, I was listening to some things earlier. Bill [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1400.44s)]
*  Clinton right now is younger than Trump and Biden and he was president 30 years ago. Well, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1404.76s)]
*  and Ruby Bridges, born versus, born versus brown to education or whatever. Yeah. Younger than both [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1410.6s)]
*  of them, like considerably. And Clinton looks like shit, bro. I don't know if you've seen him. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1415.56s)]
*  Yes. If you think Biden is a fucking scarecrow, then you got to look at Clinton. Oh, really? [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1419.0s)]
*  I mean, he's got a whole life left in his body at like four heart attacks. He's skinny as hell. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1423.64s)]
*  Oh, I'm usually. Yeah, yeah. It's a real shame what being married to Hillary Clinton for that [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1426.84s)]
*  long. And he was cheating on her. Imagine he was faithful to that motherfucker when he died at 60 years old. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1431.08s)]
*  Oh my God, he'd been dead. He would have gotten the second term. Hillary looks good, actually. Like, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1434.84s)]
*  she's literally sucking the life out of that man. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. It's a real damn shame. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1439.32s)]
*  Anyway, so. No, there's a movie about hocus pocus. Witches can do that. They can suck the [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1444.1200000000001s)]
*  inside of other people. It's like a thing. Can I ask y'all a question? I mean, God damn. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1447.4s)]
*  Can I ask you a question real quick before you do that? There's this crazy news story that an [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1453.56s)]
*  adult that talks to children all day on stream turned out to maybe be a pedophile. Can you guys [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1460.76s)]
*  believe? Guys, can you fucking believe that the adult that talks to children on stream for eight [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1467.56s)]
*  hours to 12 hours a day and has dedicated their life to playing video games might be into kids? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1475.8799999999999s)]
*  Allegedly. I mean, allegedly. But I'm just saying, like, did anybody see this coming? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1482.44s)]
*  Like, I'm shocked. Wow. I just can't even imagine. Yeah. Like, who, what's his name, this guy? [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1486.84s)]
*  I think you're talking about Dr. Disrespect. Oh, Dr. Disrespect. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's a doctor. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1494.2s)]
*  Do you know who he is? Okay. Do you know the whole story? Pediatrician? I know a lot of it. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1497.8s)]
*  I've never seen someone handle a pedophilia accusation more confidently. Yeah, it's really [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1501.64s)]
*  crazy. He leaned in. Yeah. Yeah. To the point that people are like, I don't think he did it. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1507.88s)]
*  He goes, I don't apologize for shit. Well, maybe. We start. Can you give me a breakdown? Because [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1512.3600000000001s)]
*  up until this story happened, I had no idea who this guy was. I'd never heard of him. So he's a [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1517.72s)]
*  popular- OG streamer, apparently. Yeah, he's like a Twitch streamer, former Twitch streamer, current [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1522.1200000000001s)]
*  YouTube streamer. For the record, I don't consume his content. I'm not like the most privy. I just [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1526.6000000000001s)]
*  researched this for the sake of this content. Why you guys have too much overlap in your interests? [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1531.0800000000002s)]
*  Exactly. Yeah, I don't need to study game film. So basically, he's a really popular streamer. He [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1533.88s)]
*  was on Twitch for the longest time. I don't know when exactly he started. Right now, he's 42 years [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1540.3600000000001s)]
*  old. He created this character called Dr. Disrespect. He's like 6'8". He can dunk. He talks [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1543.88s)]
*  shit on stream, and he has a huge audience, huge fan base. People love him. And so for years, he [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1548.68s)]
*  was doing this thing on Twitch. There was no problem. And then 2017, he comes on not as the [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1552.5200000000002s)]
*  character, but as himself and is on stream. And he's kind of sad. And he's talking about how he [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1556.92s)]
*  apologizes to his wife and family for being unfaithful. So that's all that came out in 2017. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1562.3600000000001s)]
*  And then the whole audience was like, we don't care. We're 15. Who gives a shit? So then fast [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1567.5600000000002s)]
*  forward 2020, he basically gets taken off of Twitch. He gets banned. He can't be on Twitch [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1571.88s)]
*  anymore. Apparently, the gaming space is undergoing a version of Me Too. So he's banned on Twitch, [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1577.16s)]
*  and he signed an exclusivity deal with Twitch that had not expired. So then he basically settled [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1582.5200000000002s)]
*  with Twitch, and Twitch paid him out. All right. So then that's 2022. He immediately goes to [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1587.8s)]
*  YouTube and starts going right on YouTube. Basically, fast forward to 2024, an ex-Twitch [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1593.48s)]
*  employee tweets out that he- I mean, it's crazy they would have to pay him. Yeah. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1599.1599999999999s)]
*  You think there'd be a clause in a contract? Yeah, a morality clause. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1603.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. You start talking to a little kid that they don't have to pay. He got paid to talk to [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1606.2s)]
*  an underage girl. That's remarkable. Yeah, really is crazy. So 2024, ex-Twitch employee comes out [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1609.72s)]
*  and says he had been banned because he'd been caught messaging a minor on the DM service of [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1615.48s)]
*  Twitch known as Whisper. Which I don't think he knew was making money. Now, I'm sure he messaged [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1621.16s)]
*  minors all the time because it's kids watching the show. It's the inappropriate nature of how [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1626.6s)]
*  he messaged her, allegedly. Yeah. Like for example, if you're the guy from Blue's Clues and you've [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1631.4s)]
*  got a bunch of kids sending you fucking letters every single week, and you write them back and [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1637.24s)]
*  say, hey, thanks for watching the show. Stay in school. Stay in school, et cetera. That's totally [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1640.84s)]
*  fine. When you're engaging in inappropriate DMs with an underage girl, now you get paid millions [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1644.84s)]
*  of dollars by Twitch. That's what happens. So apparently according to the correspondence, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1651.3999999999999s)]
*  he had planned to meet with her at TwitchCon. And then according to his own tweet vindicating [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1655.9599999999998s)]
*  himself, he claimed that the messages got a little inappropriate in nature or something to that [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1661.8s)]
*  effect. Again, I'm not an expert on the story, and it is kind of serious, so I don't know all the details. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1666.36s)]
*  I think there's no such thing as a little inappropriate with an underage girl. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1668.84s)]
*  Right? It's just either inappropriate or not. Yeah. Not a little. Just as a general rule, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1672.28s)]
*  don't meet up with minors. Yeah. Unless there's a tweet or a text being like, hey, your parents [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1676.6s)]
*  are going to be there. You and your parents can come just to get out ahead of any of it. I'm not [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1682.04s)]
*  meeting you alone. Just don't even talk to them. I mean, that's your fan base. Thanks for support. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1686.28s)]
*  Yeah, thumbs up. Exactly. Thumbs up. Stay in school. All the other pleasantries. Yeah. So this [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1691.8s)]
*  happened apparently in 2017, and people speculate that that was the reason for his apology back then. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1697.48s)]
*  According to his tweet, these were casual, mutual conversations that sometimes leaned too much in [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1702.92s)]
*  the direction of being inappropriate, but nothing more. He claimed he had no intention of meeting [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1707.0s)]
*  this person and then edited his Twitter statement to remove the mention of the minor, but then [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1710.92s)]
*  re-edited it back in once people were like, wait a second, did you just cut out the fact that it was [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1714.28s)]
*  a minor that you confirmed it? And he was like, all right, I put it back in. So it seems like he kind [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1718.1200000000001s)]
*  of bungled his little, his apology here. And then he denied being a pedophile, which is a good move. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1721.56s)]
*  And then YouTube demonetized his account. And then he got dropped from like a bunch of stuff. He was [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1727.64s)]
*  like doing collabs with a ton of different companies. He was working with like the 49ers. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1732.2s)]
*  He was doing like a video game that he was going to release with the studio. They got, they dropped [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1735.72s)]
*  him. And apparently the thing got sent to like the child exploitation service of the United States. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1739.72s)]
*  And they, I guess, saw it, but then didn't investigate. I don't know exactly what the [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1745.32s)]
*  facts are with that. So that is like what currently happened as of like last week, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1749.0s)]
*  as far as I understand it, but there's more to come. So question is why didn't Twitch do [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1752.84s)]
*  something about this in 2017 when they found out about it? But they didn't do that until 2020. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1759.48s)]
*  This happened in 2017. So the question is, did Twitch know about it? And then if they did, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1765.32s)]
*  why did they keep him on for three years knowing that he had solicited a minor, allegedly, or did [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1769.32s)]
*  Twitch not know about it, in which case they need to do a better job of like surveying their servers [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1773.3999999999999s)]
*  and knowing what people are saying to their audience. So that's the one question that people [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1777.8s)]
*  are like, okay, that's pretty weird. Second question. Now people are pointing at the [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1781.4s)]
*  duplicity of Twitch that they're going after this guy, rightfully so, right? If what he did is true, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1784.92s)]
*  that's fucked up. But then you have these like bathtub streamers. So like on Twitch, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1790.68s)]
*  you'll have like these young, these girls that are full grown women that are basically trying to like [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1796.68s)]
*  soft core cam their way into like getting only fans people. And they will like stream in a bathtub [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1802.52s)]
*  or they'll stream like with everything just their tits cut off and covered and the age to sign up [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1807.8s)]
*  for Twitch is 13. So basically, everyone's like, well, wait a second, what he did is fucked up. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1812.12s)]
*  But what these girls are doing where they're basically making sexualized content for people [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1817.48s)]
*  13 and up. That's also fucked up. So what is the what are you going to do about that? Yo, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1822.2s)]
*  is writing sexualized content for kids weird too? I would say so if you're doing erotica for children, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1827.0s)]
*  like euphoria is erotica for children. I don't know if that shows for children. No, no, no, no, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1833.32s)]
*  meaning like, for them to do to them to do like they're writing adults are playing the children. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1838.9199999999998s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like it is a kind of I understand you're trying to capture this like [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1843.56s)]
*  age of innocence. And you know, there's so much happening when you're the hormonal when a kid, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1847.0s)]
*  there's discovery, etc. And we're all probably interested at this in this time in our lives, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1851.8799999999999s)]
*  right? But you do have to spend a lot of time thinking about kids fucking when you're writing [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1857.32s)]
*  the show. Right? Like it is it is an odd thing. Like I remember when we were young, we're watching [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1864.04s)]
*  like, you know, Beverly Hills now to a no. And there's like sex scenes and shit for teenagers. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1869.0s)]
*  And we were young. So it made sense. didn't think anything of it. But there's adult producers that [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1874.6799999999998s)]
*  write the scenes and direct the scenes. Can you moan louder? moan like a teenager. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1879.72s)]
*  Yeah, right. It is. Yeah. What is? What is the that is a little odd. It's peculiar. It is very [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1884.4399999999998s)]
*  it's not illegal because they're adults playing them. Yeah. But at the same time, you're imagining [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1892.84s)]
*  be also as an actor, you're imagining hooking up with a teenager. You know, stop making you [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1897.6399999999999s)]
*  for a weird because I like that. Why are we watching this? Go back to believe in their [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1902.52s)]
*  fuck this fuck. Is there weird shit like Game of Thrones? Probably. No, no. Yeah. No. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1909.56s)]
*  No. No. That's fantasy. That's fantasy. The rules don't apply. Yeah, it's fantasy. I think. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1916.84s)]
*  Who's fantasy? There's dragons. Nisi's fucking she was like a little girl. Yeah. Renear was like, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1925.56s)]
*  yeah, the first time her uncle took her out. That's also y'all remembered that part. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1930.6s)]
*  Yeah. I forgot about that immediately. It's not the things I focus on. I focus on the dragons. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1934.2s)]
*  Not dragons. What? They reminded us of it this episode. But yeah, isn't there like a [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1939.88s)]
*  I don't articulate what I'm saying. No, I get it. You articulated it. But then it really fell apart [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1947.56s)]
*  with that Game of Thrones thing. Yeah, but it's fantasy. It doesn't count. Yeah. It is creepy to [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1951.72s)]
*  write sexual lines for children, even if they're not children. Actually, even if the actors are [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1958.2s)]
*  adults, it's I don't like it. What if it's based on true story? It doesn't matter. Makes it worse. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1962.12s)]
*  Because if I wrote a story about me fucking when I was 17, that's a way we're centrally 17 year old [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1970.12s)]
*  person. Get no pussy. No, no, this is a good point. When I tell y'all about the first time I [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1974.84s)]
*  fucked or when I got hit when I was younger, y'all are pedophiles. Yeah. I'm not. Yeah. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1984.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. I don't enjoy those stories. Y'all are thinking about me getting hit as a teenager. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1990.04s)]
*  I wasn't. I don't enjoy those stories. First of all, second of all, I only think about you [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1994.52s)]
*  getting hit as an adult. Yeah. Yeah. It was way different. I was so bad at it when I was younger. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=1998.44s)]
*  So bad at getting hit. But yeah, it is. I wouldn't want to do it. But I don't know if it should be [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2007.0s)]
*  illegal. You know what I'm saying? I don't think anything illegal is happening here, but it does [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2011.08s)]
*  start to feel odd. Yeah, I think in their mind, they're capturing a reality. Yeah. And it's a [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2015.8s)]
*  reality maybe they think adults should be privy to because I don't think I knew and I don't know how [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2021.16s)]
*  accurate the show is. But when I'm watching the show, my kids are whiling. I think that's what [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2025.24s)]
*  they're going. They're going for high drama. And there's no higher drama than like the innocence [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2029.4s)]
*  of a child being, you know, taken advantage of or something like that. Like if the show takes place [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2033.24s)]
*  in college, you're like, oh, they're fucking. That's not that bad. Yeah. But when the show [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2037.72s)]
*  takes place in high school and a trans girl is getting fucking rinsed out by the other person's [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2041.48s)]
*  hotel room, you're like, oh my God, this is wrong. So they know what they're doing is wrong. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2045.96s)]
*  But the intention matters, though, if you're just trying to tell a story, and this is a necessary [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2050.84s)]
*  part to tell that story. That's different than these cam girls who are clearly trying to sell [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2055.16s)]
*  sex without selling sex. So it's like the intention matters. Yeah. And like they're feeding you into [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2060.52s)]
*  an only fans so they can monetize it. Euphoria is the show in and of itself. Nobody's putting on [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2065.2400000000002s)]
*  is for you to jerk off and shit like I don't think Jacob. Oh, Lord, it's pretty hot. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2069.24s)]
*  What about what about anime? [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2075.72s)]
*  Well, what about nobody jerks off the anime? Yo, come on. No, stop. Stop you. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2079.16s)]
*  Stop. Don't make anime. Right. Yeah. And it's kids watching anime. So what they're never fucking in [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2084.2s)]
*  it. They just make them have to go to Amazon. They never fuck on Twitch. Them girls in the bathtub [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2093.3999999999996s)]
*  don't fuck on Twitch. So I'm trying to set up the pipeline to sign up for the only fans. Oh, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2097.8s)]
*  you're saying they also have only fans. Yeah, it's a pipeline. Got it. Got it. The whole point is to [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2102.76s)]
*  get you to sign up to the only fans so I can monetize my tits. No, I got you. I got you. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2107.4s)]
*  And I think that's the case. I got to think of specific instances if there's Twitch streamers [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2111.48s)]
*  that are genuinely going straight from there to only fans. Well, that's the thing like, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2114.52s)]
*  running a legit business is exhausting. Yeah. Because you always got these annoying motherfuckers. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2118.92s)]
*  You're the person who's the CEO of Twitch and you're like, hey, we got this great platform. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2125.0s)]
*  People can play video games. They can talk to their friends. It's going to be awesome. We got [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2127.8s)]
*  a sketch. We're going to make a sketch happen. It's going to be great. It's going to be so cool. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2130.5200000000004s)]
*  And you're going to see like regular dudes that are playing video games with professional athletes [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2133.7200000000003s)]
*  and the whole world's going to come together and it's going to be this great thing. You share the [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2137.48s)]
*  passion. And then these pierced nipple bitches are in their bathtubs trying to draw 10 year olds over [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2140.2000000000003s)]
*  to fucking only fans. And you have to come like make a rule. But whatever rule you make, you're [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2145.0800000000004s)]
*  going to look like a hypocrite because it's going to stop your Twitch users from doing something else. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2150.1200000000003s)]
*  It's exhausting. Yeah. But if you're, Twitch is also owned by Amazon. So you got to just be on [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2155.4s)]
*  the safe side of everything. And that's the other thing because like they're not making money on [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2160.28s)]
*  Twitch. They're making money from Amazon. So you're a trillion dollar company and now you got to worry [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2164.0400000000004s)]
*  about your brand being tarnished by these bathtub bitches. Yeah. So you would think a brand like [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2168.6000000000004s)]
*  that would just play it overly safe because this is a loss leader for us. We're just trying to get [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2174.1200000000003s)]
*  a market share, getting this thing, whatever it is. But I'm not, I'm not taking, I don't want my [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2177.88s)]
*  main business to take a hit off of this. So we're going to be overly safe. And if that costs us some [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2182.28s)]
*  users, who cares? We need Amazon web services to be killing it. We need Amazon, the website to be [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2185.96s)]
*  killing it. This Twitch thing is fifth on our list of income streams. Yeah. Anyway, it is what it is. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2190.52s)]
*  So it'll be interesting to see what happens with this. Cause he's like, look, Twitch paid me out. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2196.6800000000003s)]
*  They didn't think it was that egregious. Like YouTube is cool with it. They got sent to this [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2200.2000000000003s)]
*  exploitation board for the government. They didn't investigate it. So, so it's not that big a deal. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2205.88s)]
*  I think come out and say exactly what it was. I think that's his position. But then everyone's [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2210.92s)]
*  kind of saying that like, yo, just release the messages. Yo, release that shit because we're [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2214.2000000000003s)]
*  assuming the worst. Anytime pedophilia gets thrown around, we're assuming the worst. And if you say [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2217.48s)]
*  inappropriate messages, we're deeming what we think are inappropriate messages. Yeah. Right. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2221.7200000000003s)]
*  Maybe this is just enough room for interpretation that he's like, ah, people might think XYZ, [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2227.0s)]
*  whether he intended to or not. I don't know. Our brains are always going to go to the worst [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2231.56s)]
*  possible scenarios. But in 2017, if he said, oh, I was being unfaithful, then that means there was [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2234.84s)]
*  an encounter. That's also true. That's also true. There's an encounter somewhere. Yeah. Yeah. You're [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2240.6000000000004s)]
*  not being like emotionally unfaithful. Yeah. Yeah. And if you're over the kid, that's just as fuck. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2247.48s)]
*  Apparently there's no proof of an encounter thus far. Sure. Sure. Sure. But still, like if he has [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2251.8s)]
*  to address that and his wife is upset about it, then there has to be something with sexual [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2256.28s)]
*  maybe that's just what he said. So he didn't have to say the real reason. That's. Yeah. No, [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2260.36s)]
*  that's not. He says nothing illegal happened. No pictures are shared. No crimes were committed. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2265.88s)]
*  Even though I never met the individual, I even, I went through lengthy arbitration regarding a [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2269.48s)]
*  civil dispute with Twitch. The case was resolved by a settlement. Let me be clear. It was not a [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2273.6400000000003s)]
*  criminal case against me. No criminal charges have ever been brought against me. Okay. That is, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2277.7200000000003s)]
*  that doesn't say I didn't do anything inappropriate at all. Who cares? We got to talk about something [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2281.1600000000003s)]
*  else. The. It's too weird. It's too system. All right guys, we're going to take a break real quick [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2286.28s)]
*  because I got to tell you about the flavored air category that is quickly becoming the leading [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2293.0800000000004s)]
*  alternative to vaping and smoking. It is a whole new movement movement towards better health. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2296.92s)]
*  And it's led by the sponsors of this little clip right here. Fume. Fume is award winning flavored [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2301.0800000000004s)]
*  air device and flavored air is not vaping. If vaping was like a sugar filled soda, fume cores [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2306.44s)]
*  would be closer to like an herbal tea. They got a bunch of delicious flavors to choose from. And [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2310.92s)]
*  with flavored air, you can satisfy the oral fixation. It's completely natural. It's just [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2315.0s)]
*  herbs and you can use it anywhere. And let's get a nice little wooden solid feel, right? Also [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2319.16s)]

*  There's something that I really want to talk to you guys about and it is specific is this [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2408.6000000000004s)]
*  Bronnie story. Yeah. Right. And I really want to get you guys takes on it because there's something [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2414.1200000000003s)]
*  that's happening in media that I thought was fascinating. So Bronnie gets drafted in the [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2419.48s)]
*  second round. He goes to the Lakers. I think Rich Paul was telling teams not to draft him and that [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2423.0s)]
*  if they did draft him, that he would go play in Australia. So they basically set the situation [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2427.56s)]
*  up for him to go play for the Lakers with LeBron. And almost immediately I saw these big media [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2431.56s)]
*  figures coming out and instead of being critical of the fact that this happened, exposing other [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2439.32s)]
*  nepotism in sports coming to like the defensive Bronnie and LeBron and the Lakers. They talk about [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2445.72s)]
*  nepotism in the back office. They talk about nepotism on other teams. I think Giannis's brother [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2453.0s)]
*  plays with the Bucks. But it's really interesting to me. Like it shows, in my opinion, the power of [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2459.72s)]
*  LeBron because the easiest story, the most salacious story is to go at this situation and completely [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2465.48s)]
*  undercut the fact that they drafted him. And they are defending the decision and making good arguments. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2474.28s)]
*  I mean nepotism is right, right, right all over the NBA. Like there's so many coaches whose dad [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2483.0800000000004s)]
*  were coaches. Everywhere. The GM, the owner. The second you have anything, like I have a daughter, I want to give her [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2489.6400000000003s)]
*  fucking everything. I can't wait to nepotize. I can't wait to nepotize. So it is, I understand why it's frustrating [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2494.6000000000004s)]
*  if you don't have kin. Or I understand why it's frustrating if your parents didn't have something to [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2502.6000000000004s)]
*  give you. Because you're like, well look at that unfair advantage that that person has. 100%. But you can't blame [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2509.48s)]
*  a parent for wanting to provide for their kid. The GM of the Mavericks, the old GM of the Mavericks, Donnie Nelson, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2514.44s)]
*  his dad was Don Nelson, the head coach of the Mavericks. What a fucking surprise that happened. I mean this is [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2518.84s)]
*  all over the coaching positions of the little kid. But I should have looked this up. But is part of the [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2523.88s)]
*  definition of nepotism like a person who doesn't deserve it? No, it's related. Just related. Oh, so then [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2528.28s)]
*  I mean the the subtext is they don't deserve it. I mean yeah but it doesn't deserve it. But if it's a [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2533.88s)]
*  part of the definition then we should encourage nepotism. But no, I mean in all industries. If [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2538.92s)]
*  if you earned it, like for example, nobody said Clay Thompson is a nepo baby. His dad was in [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2545.7200000000003s)]
*  no one says Steph Curry is a nepo baby. Right? Like their parents were both in the league. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2555.0s)]
*  Right? There are plenty of people who have you know relatives. Even Steph Curry is a contributor, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2560.6s)]
*  a valuable contributor on teams. Yeah. So Ronnie did not. Ronnie might have a successful NBA career. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2565.48s)]
*  I don't know. What he's showed so far is that there's no reason for him to get drafted. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2569.96s)]
*  Even in his draft workouts they were going through him. They were like he kind of shot shitty. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2575.16s)]
*  And it's like his only thing is to be 3 and D. Right? He doesn't have the ball handling skills [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2580.3599999999997s)]
*  and passing skills to really be a point guard. He's an undersized too and he wasn't even shooting [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2586.2s)]
*  the ball that well. So he didn't really exemplify somebody who would want to draft even in the [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2589.9599999999996s)]
*  second round. But he got drafted. Who cares? So what? But let's not make up the fact that there was [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2593.8799999999997s)]
*  a little help here. I think it proves that no one ever really cared about nepotism. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2599.16s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like when the whole thing came out, like when the whole like that nepo baby [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2603.16s)]
*  article first dropped like what? 20, 17, 20, 18 or whatever. Yeah. Like everyone was pissed. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2607.72s)]
*  Oh, nepotism is everywhere. I don't think anyone ever really cared. I think it just wasn't [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2611.72s)]
*  a thing that benefited them or their communities. So people are like, oh, this is fucked up. Yeah. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2616.12s)]
*  It's white privilege. It's the same argument. No one really cared sometimes, but other people. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2619.72s)]
*  But now that everyone could benefit from nepotism or now that more people could benefit from nepotism, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2625.48s)]
*  I think everyone's gonna be like, a little nepotism is fine. I've said this about [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2629.3199999999997s)]
*  a white privilege in Hollywood or whatever. It is the perfect white privilege in any industry. It [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2633.0s)]
*  is the perfect argument. If you're not a white person to give yourself more opportunity. Yeah. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2641.64s)]
*  Right. You're like, Hey, these white people are just hiring white people and that's fucked up. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2647.48s)]
*  And that's indicative of racism. I'm not white. So that'd be really awesome. If you hire me, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2651.0s)]
*  I have to, I have to find a competitive advantage. I don't have the nepotism. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2655.96s)]
*  They have the nepotism or they have the whiteness or whatever the fuck it is. So I have to make that [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2659.56s)]
*  look bad. I have to make that look radioactive. So I get opportunity. I get what you're saying. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2663.64s)]
*  Do you know what I'm saying? But I, and not to switch topics, but the reason why I support [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2668.44s)]
*  nepotism now, because I'm like, this is a motivation for you to achieve something where you can actually [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2672.6s)]
*  pass it down to your kin. So it's like, I think everybody should be- People who are anti-nepotism [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2678.44s)]
*  would argue that that lane is blocked because of nepotism. You see what I'm saying? [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2683.24s)]
*  I mean, you can always make your own lane. And then to the- [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2686.36s)]
*  Ho ho, pull yourself up by your boots. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2689.56s)]
*  That's what I'm talking about. We converted him. Trump won. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2691.96s)]
*  He liked the debate. Let's go. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2695.88s)]
*  I like what you're talking about. Keep going. Keep going. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2697.2400000000002s)]
*  I've got to think of this more. You should have let him play out. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2700.76s)]
*  I know. But I'm also, so to me, I didn't like the white casting shit when minorities did it, [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2704.36s)]
*  because once we started getting all the roles, then instead of being like, Hey guys, we just [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2710.92s)]
*  wanted to be fair. All of a sudden they'd be like, Oh, I'm sorry, white man, are you not getting [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2714.6s)]
*  the roles? And it's like, Oh, you didn't want fairness. You just wanted to be the white man. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2718.2799999999997s)]
*  That drives me crazy. And I will say the Nepal baby argument is just, it's just like Jiu-Jitsu [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2722.36s)]
*  or whatever. Y'all got nepotism. How do I flip this? It's your advantage. How do I flip it to [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2728.04s)]
*  make it my advantage and your disadvantage? Which straight up argument, that's a fucking great way [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2732.2799999999997s)]
*  to do it. That's a great way to flip the advantage. And that's what you're supposed to do. I don't [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2737.16s)]
*  subscribe to that idea largely, but like, I also think with Brawny, we're all so excited. First of [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2741.24s)]
*  all, it's a few things. One, like you said, media is on his side because they can't lose LeBron [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2746.8399999999997s)]
*  because Jordan proved if you fuck with us, we could just not give your publication any love [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2750.3599999999997s)]
*  and ESPN needs LeBron too. So media is on his side too. I think we all just want to see a father and [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2754.68s)]
*  son playing the same crowd. Fucking awesome. That outweighs any nepotism we feel. And it's [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2759.3999999999996s)]
*  the second round. The Mavs drafted an Indian Punjabi guy that six years ago that I knew would [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2763.56s)]
*  never play in the league. And Mark Cuban is like, we just made a billion fans. Fire. I love that. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2768.6s)]
*  It's late in the second round. Who gives a fuck? So if you went number nine, we'd have a problem [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2773.64s)]
*  with it. So it's not like the Lakers aren't going to sell out every game. They are, because LeBron's [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2777.72s)]
*  on the team. But if you look at it as a financial decision, it's not nepotism. Correct. If I'm [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2781.08s)]
*  Brawny, that's what I would say. I go, guys, this is a financial decision. Like there are people [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2789.96s)]
*  that really want to see us playing the game together. It's going to get so many clips, [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2794.84s)]
*  even if it's for 30 seconds, it's going to blow things up. When we go to, it's not only just when [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2798.44s)]
*  we go to other cities, they're going to sell out because my dad is going to do that. But around the [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2803.88s)]
*  world, if you're interested in the game, you're going to want to see this. So they're probably [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2807.7200000000003s)]
*  going to pay me the league minimum for a second round rookie and they're going to make 20 million [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2811.48s)]
*  off of that. This is a business decision. I would say that. And then you shut everybody up about skill. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2817.48s)]
*  Then that just steps on all your hard work. It's like, I work so hard to get to the league. And [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2822.68s)]
*  the only reason why I'm getting signed, just because it's going to sell some hard tickets. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2827.08s)]
*  But people know what the hard work did, right? Like four points and like three assists and like [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2830.2s)]
*  one rebound. Like we understand the merit and the merit isn't sufficient. So we're never going to [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2834.04s)]
*  look at you as if you're here for merit until you start balling in the league. If you start balling [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2839.7999999999997s)]
*  your ass off in the league, we shut the fuck up. It absolutely could happen. And he's going to get [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2843.72s)]
*  touches because please believe if you want to be on Bron's good side, if Bronnie comes in the game, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2849.16s)]
*  you feed him the ball. Don't you think I fucks with his psyche a little bit that he's like, [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2853.96s)]
*  damn, I wasn't good enough to actually make it to the league. Bro, he's dealt with that his whole [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2858.2799999999997s)]
*  life. His entire life. James Jr. There is nobody more comfortable. Exactly. There's nobody more [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2862.2s)]
*  comfortable thinking that people are doing things for him just because of his dad than LeBron James [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2868.3599999999997s)]
*  Jr. So I think he's I think he's almost like built a callousness to it in terms of like he [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2872.68s)]
*  I imagine he doesn't resent it. He goes, this is the world I live in. I accept it. And I got to do [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2881.08s)]
*  my best to go out there who is probably why hoops is so nice to him. Because at the end of the day, [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2884.68s)]
*  his dad can't shoot the ball for him. He got to go out there and ball. Yeah. You know what I mean? [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2889.72s)]
*  Like, yeah, but doesn't this happen? This is not exactly the same, but similar. We're like, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2895.0s)]
*  a guy will be close to breaking the all time scoring record or some type of crazy record and [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2898.6s)]
*  people won't play D as hard if it's like a regular season game, right? They said that about [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2901.8s)]
*  home run records. Right, right, right, right. Michael Strahan sack record in the NFL. Brett [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2905.48s)]
*  Favre just like gave up the last sack. And there's kind of like a gentlemanness to it where it's like, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2909.88s)]
*  look, this doesn't really matter. It's good for the game for you to get this thing after you make [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2914.04s)]
*  the point or the sack. The game stops and they throw fucking confetti and shit. Because it's [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2917.4s)]
*  just kind of good for the patentry of the game. And I kind of feel like it's the same thing where [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2921.4s)]
*  like, it's good for the game as a whole to see the greatest of all time, arguably the greatest with [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2924.76s)]
*  his son playing for us. That's awesome. It's amazing. I know I'm a Laker hater, but now they [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2929.24s)]
*  got a coach that I love. And they got a father son duo playing like I'm so excited to watch a [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2934.04s)]
*  Laker game. And I don't think they're going to contend for anything. Not this year, but I'm [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2938.12s)]
*  excited to watch it. And I think it's awesome for everyone except people who are better than him in [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2942.2799999999997s)]
*  college that they're looking at, you know, he took much but it's one spot on 30. I think there was [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2948.2s)]
*  some posts and it was about like another guy that was on USC. Yeah, you saw that when he dropped [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2956.04s)]
*  like 14 a game and he didn't get drafted. That is what it is. Maybe he'll go play in Europe somewhere. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2960.36s)]
*  Maybe he won't. Maybe he'll coach who knows what he's gonna do with his life. But this is the nature [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2965.08s)]
*  of things. Yes. But Bronnie scoring five a game didn't impact him scoring 14 again. You know what [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2969.96s)]
*  I mean? 100%. Like he could have scored 30 again. 100%. And also the thing I would say is like, [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2974.44s)]
*  before we criticize this situation, I want everybody to think about how they got every job in [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2979.4s)]
*  their life, how they got every apartment in their life, how they got every bottle service at a club [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2984.52s)]
*  and they're like nepotism or cronyism is the other term when you're not related. cronyism has [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2991.08s)]
*  benefited you too. Everybody gets everything because of the people they know. Yeah, that is [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=2996.7599999999998s)]
*  the nature. Get better cronies, bro. Real talk. If you don't got shit, your cronies suck. Chris Rock said that about [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3001.16s)]
*  Bill Clinton writing like a letter recommendation for Monica Lewinsky. He says something like that's [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3006.7599999999998s)]
*  his friend. How many of you guys got a job because your friend recommended you? And I remember I'm 15 [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3010.92s)]
*  or 16 or whatever and watched them like, yeah, that's a great point. Even I knew that back then. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3015.8s)]
*  My first job was a friend. Target. That's how I got it. I actually hope Bronnie balls out. I would love it. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3019.32s)]
*  Yeah, I hope Bronnie balls out, dude. I would love it. And if anybody could bring the best out of him, [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3028.84s)]
*  it's his dad. Yeah. Yeah. And that was not always bad. I mean, fucking Bollywood. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3032.6800000000003s)]
*  That's what the Nepo baby thing that we've been talking about for decades. It's all nepotism. Now [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3037.48s)]
*  it's shifting. But back when I was growing up, it's all nepotism. Yeah. Do you think LeBron gets the [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3041.32s)]
*  senior on the back of his jersey? Yeah, that's gotta be so cool. I mean, if they just want to [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3046.28s)]
*  sell more jerseys, yeah. Switch it up. James Senior, he's as old as us. Bron's number is nine, [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3051.56s)]
*  right? Six. Six and nine is a pair. That's a little weird. That shit is so funny. It's a little weird. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3056.84s)]
*  Sixty-nine with your dad, bro. They thought out everything but that. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3061.64s)]
*  Not a six, Bronnie. Not a six, Bronnie. If you sell them together, bro, that shit is awesome. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3065.56s)]
*  Nah, they gotta do junior and senior because parents would do that. Yes. Like, if you got a kid, [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3068.7599999999998s)]
*  you're gonna get the dad jersey and then the son jersey. Awesome. Yeah, this is... [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3074.52s)]
*  Sixty-six and nine with your family, bro. You're fired. You got the Celtics winning championships [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3078.36s)]
*  and the Lakers aren't. Again, I think Redick will make them really good, but not this year. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3082.36s)]
*  But they're not good, but you got fucking father-son playing the greatest of all time, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3085.7999999999997s)]
*  maybe with the son. Like, what a time for the league. The two anchor franchises, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3089.56s)]
*  PR through the roof. It has fire. Yeah, it's interesting. This is the reaction to it. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3095.4s)]
*  I was shocked, man. I think, honestly, LeBron owes Michael Jordan a thank you for this because [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3100.6s)]
*  these ESPNs... Remember when Sports Illustrated I was referencing? Michael Jordan plays baseball. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3106.12s)]
*  Sports Illustrated writes an article that covers his bagate, Michael, basically insulting him for [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3110.68s)]
*  playing baseball. Michael Jordan never taught Sports Illustrated again. ESPN is looking at this like [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3114.68s)]
*  do we want to insult LeBron for this or do we want LeBron to like us? And then George Carl, [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3119.56s)]
*  I think his son played. So like there's nepotism all over the week. Now we got to call it out [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3124.92s)]
*  everywhere. Let's just support this and we're good. We keep LeBron. We don't piss off other [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3128.04s)]
*  execs and we got to call out later. We're good. I'm going to throw out an allegedly on this one [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3132.52s)]
*  because I have no proof to back it up. Oh, this is going to be good. Yeah. It's feelings. Juicy. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3136.52s)]
*  Feelings. So I'm sure you guys have seen there was an article that came out talking about how like [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3141.56s)]
*  Jordan's stats were inflated. Oh, you see that? I haven't read the article, but I've heard about [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3146.68s)]
*  it. So there's a few articles that came out talking about Jordan's stats were inflated. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3151.3999999999996s)]
*  There's like lots of content online talking about like, oh, Jordan really wasn't that nice. They're [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3155.24s)]
*  like people reviewing old Jordan clips and like saying, oh, look, there was no defense back in [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3159.3199999999997s)]
*  the day. Yeah. But what they did is they reviewed footage and then compared them to the stats that [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3163.7999999999997s)]
*  the Chicago Bulls had delivered to the NBA. Yeah. And they found a discrepancy. Oh, there was less [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3169.08s)]
*  rebounds, less assists, et cetera. Especially the year he won defensive player of the year, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3174.68s)]
*  they would just award him steals that he didn't get. Now. Oh shit. One, the reaction is, oh shit. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3177.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Two, this is what I heard and this could be absolute bullocks. I heard Bron's team is behind [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3185.56s)]
*  that. I love that. I love that. Oh, I love that. Behind outing it. Oh, okay. I love that because [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3193.3199999999997s)]
*  what did Jordan do? As soon as LeBron won with the cast, he said, let's drop this last dance [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3202.2s)]
*  shit. Like if y'all go there, go. Oh yeah. The fact that LeBron did the movie probably drove [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3207.0s)]
*  Jordan fucking crazy. Oh my God. That's funny. So Jordan is a dog competing 30 years out of league. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3213.24s)]
*  LeBron got that dog in him too, dude. He's still in it though. He's still in it. So it makes sense. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3219.96s)]
*  It's like, yeah, he's got a legacy to protect and he's got a legacy to make. Like Jordan's just [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3223.56s)]
*  doing it for like, just protection. But the fact that he's trying to, now I'm not saying he is, but [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3226.52s)]
*  allegedly is behind tarnishing Jordan's accomplishments that he knows that he won't [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3231.96s)]
*  beat so that he can have the better numbers. Like if we stop believing in Jordan's numbers, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3238.84s)]
*  now you can make the argument that maybe LeBron is the greatest of all time. You can. Yeah. But [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3246.04s)]
*  then it's like Jordan's rings aren't padded. Sex. I mean, it's like, no, 100%. I said this [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3250.84s)]
*  years ago when LeBron, I think, went to LA and now that he's staying in LA and I love, [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3257.2400000000002s)]
*  I think Reddix is going to be great, blah, blah, blah. I love that he's playing with the sun. But [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3260.76s)]
*  the fact that he's not chasing the best team and he's like, well, I'm just going to retire in this [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3263.48s)]
*  beautiful sunny place. I get it. But I do think Jordan would never have done that. Like LeBron [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3268.28s)]
*  knows they're not, they don't got a team to win the ring. Jordan would have benched his kid [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3273.2400000000002s)]
*  immediately. Jordan ain't doing that. But Jordan would have gone to a team like, I don't know, [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3276.36s)]
*  maybe the Sixers where there's an MVP candidate right there or whatever. Dude, the Nuggets wanted [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3281.0s)]
*  him three years ago or whenever he went to the Lakers. Can you imagine LeBron and Jokic? Get the [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3284.92s)]
*  fuck out of here. To me, that would have been the Jordan move. I do think back in the day, [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3289.24s)]
*  there was a bit more loyalty to organizations. Yeah, he went to the best team. LeBron went to [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3292.6s)]
*  the best location. So do you think he would have went to the best team or do you think that his [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3297.3199999999997s)]
*  competitive instinct would have been like, I'm not going to just join a good team. I'm going to beat [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3301.8799999999997s)]
*  that team. He was like, he needed Phil. He needed Scottie. He went and got Rodman. I need the best [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3306.4399999999996s)]
*  support. I'm going to be the alpha, but we're going to have a great team. And he made it very clear. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3310.8399999999997s)]
*  If Scottie's gone, if Phil is gone, I'm not going to bet. I just don't see Jordan joining a super [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3314.52s)]
*  team. I can see him make one, but I don't think he'd be like, oh, they're the best team. I'll just [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3318.12s)]
*  go and be on that. I think he'd go to the best team where he's still the best player. Does that [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3322.52s)]
*  make sense? He's still the alpha. He's not going to go to... He's always going to be the best. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3325.64s)]
*  Exactly. So I think he's going to be like, all right, well, let's go to the best supporting cast. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3328.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm not going to go to this team where they don't have one. You get what I'm saying, right? I get [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3332.04s)]
*  what you're saying, but I mean, again... His ego wouldn't allow him to admit that there's another [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3336.3599999999997s)]
*  team better. I think he would go to a better situation than the Lakers. I mean, he went to [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3340.7599999999998s)]
*  the Wizards. Yeah, but that's... He went to the worst team. I mean, he couldn't lose at owning a [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3344.52s)]
*  team. So let me just get the fuck out on the court. If he didn't own the Wizards, he don't play on the [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3350.68s)]
*  Wizards. Yeah. And then after losing, he was like, I need to get out of this team. Yes, thousand [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3354.7599999999998s)]
*  percent. There's nothing that can make this team win. Yeah, thousand percent. Yeah. Yeah, there's [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3358.84s)]
*  some cool drama going on in the NBA. The NBA is cooking right now in the off season. Yeah. This [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3364.68s)]
*  draft specifically, there's this story, I don't know if you guys are reading it. The Utah story? [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3369.96s)]
*  Did you read about it? I heard about it. So that's a no? [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3373.8s)]
*  I heard shouts to Jake and Dan, my boys that we helped break not compete clauses all over the [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3378.76s)]
*  country. So do you want to break it down a little bit? So you can fill in any gaps that I have, [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3382.84s)]
*  but there is a player who played for Duke. What's his name again? Filipowski. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3388.92s)]
*  Filipowski. Cal Filipowski. So there's a podcast with Zach Lowe, who's an NBA savant, knows everything. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3393.32s)]
*  He has this guy on who's a scout. He was getting molested by his babysitter and then she groomed [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3401.0s)]
*  him and now she's divided him from his family and he's going to play for the Utah Jazz. Yeah. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3405.08s)]
*  That's the quick of it. Now, apparently he dropped in the draft because of this. Because of this. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3411.56s)]
*  That's why it's interesting. Right? So the girl I think is like seven years older than them, [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3416.92s)]
*  I think she maybe babysat him. They say that she used- Like a Macron. Yeah. So when it's- [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3420.44s)]
*  They went to prom together. Now he's apparently 18 at prom. She's 25, I think or something like [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3426.76s)]
*  that. But they didn't meet on prom night. They probably were talking when he was 17, 16. No, [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3431.5600000000004s)]
*  I think she babysat him. There's a picture of her as a babysitter with them. That's crazy. Yeah. So [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3436.6000000000004s)]
*  it's like they're saying that she groomed him and I don't know. I mean, yeah, it's grooming, [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3441.0800000000004s)]
*  but I think she basically sought a meal ticket. Like she's like, this motherfucker, this seven [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3446.0400000000004s)]
*  foot white boy is going to the NBA. I'm locking this motherfucker down. I got dick sucking skills [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3449.7200000000003s)]
*  seven years advanced. He never felt nothing like this. I remember when I was 18 years old, [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3454.04s)]
*  there was this girl who was 30 sucking my dick. And I was like, this is the most incredible thing [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3459.16s)]
*  I've ever seen in my entire life. I was like, 30 year old bitches are back. She's been in the league, [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3462.68s)]
*  bro. She wrote for Cosmopolitan. Oh, fuck. And I told my friend, I was like, yo, this girl's crazy. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3466.84s)]
*  He goes, have you ever read Cosmopolitan? And he was like, I was like, nah. He's like, it's all [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3471.72s)]
*  about dick sucking. She better be good. Yeah. Put your fucking money where you got it. The original [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3476.2799999999997s)]
*  hock to it. That's the original one. So these girls got skills that these young bucks know [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3480.12s)]
*  nothing about. She came in and apparently used some Mormonism. So that's what the, so her, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3484.6s)]
*  somebody was like, it went down the rabbit hole, this 32nd conversation on Zach Lowe. Then the [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3490.68s)]
*  guy's brother makes an account. Philipowski's brother is like, yo, you have no idea how deep [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3494.6s)]
*  this goes. Look up Mormon grooming for a little more information. And that's apparently, I haven't [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3498.44s)]
*  looked it up. That's apparently what it is. She's grooming him and indoctrinating him into [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3503.3199999999997s)]
*  Mormonism. Ironically, he gets drafted by the fucking jazz of all places. It's not ironic. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3506.68s)]
*  He fell far in the draft. Yeah. But the jazz, where the jazz like, well, fit right in. Is that [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3512.12s)]
*  what it was? Yeah. Okay. Fair enough. But crazy story. You don't think the draft want, the jazz [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3517.64s)]
*  want the Mormon kid? Oh yeah, that's true. But he's not Mormon yet, is he? Yeah. I mean, she's, [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3523.0s)]
*  she got him in the Mormon shit. Crazy story, dude. This is Mormon recruitment tactic. Yeah. Like, [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3527.48s)]
*  yo, how do we get players? Send some honey pot. Yeah, exactly. After these little teeny-bobbers. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3532.92s)]
*  They saw Britney Renner and they're like, oh, we gotta get our own little, you know, our little [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3537.32s)]
*  guys. Can we look up a picture of this girl? Yeah. Nah, she's bad. She's worked it. Yeah. Yeah, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3541.1600000000003s)]
*  she's bad. It's not like he's getting fucked over or anything like that. Like, sure, he's worked it. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3545.96s)]
*  But it is disgusting. Like, if this happened, if the genders were reversed, this would be crazy. Oh [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3549.08s)]
*  my God. Yeah. Oh, she's an insane girl. She's got crazy eyes. Oh, she's, she's insane. That's an [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3553.8s)]
*  insane girl. Yeah, you could tell. Yeah. But also she babysitting him, right? He's probably 12, [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3559.8s)]
*  but he got crazy meat because he's so tall. So she's looking at it and she's like, yo, this is [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3564.84s)]
*  gonna get so much bigger. Are you thinking of 12 year old meat right now? Yo, come on. Bro, this isn't a house of dragons. This isn't Game of Thrones. I didn't think about meat. I just said it. I said the words. I didn't think about it. I'm a doctor to despair. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3568.84s)]
*  Yo, y'all was thinking about meat and still thinking about it. I'm doctors in the building right here. You said meat. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3580.36s)]
*  You said meat. You said meat, bro. You can't say a word without thinking about it. That was wild. When I say meat, I'm thinking about the carnais solitus. That was wild. When you say meat, you're thinking about 10 year old dicks. That was wild. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3584.6s)]
*  You got the mustache already. You just need the wig and the glasses on. I swear to God, now you like boys. You call this you. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3597.48s)]
*  You call this you. You gotta go in. You gotta go in. He likes boys, yo. I said big for 12, bro. Why you don't frame a reference? Because I'm big 12, dummy. So you know just yours? Yeah. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3604.36s)]
*  Hey, Schultz. Wait a minute. You don't know what your dick looked like at 12? I don't remember, yo. That was 28 years ago. You don't remember your 12 year old dick? I don't remember my 12 year old dick. I don't think about 12 year old dick. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3622.28s)]
*  You're a fucking dick, bro. That sucks, man. This guy's a... What do you mean you don't remember? Who remembers their dick 28 years ago? He was a little fatter back then. He couldn't see it. That's fair. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3634.28s)]
*  But yeah, you remember being a child playing with your dick. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't. Are you really doing this thing? Yeah, absolutely. I'm doing this thing. What is the thing you're doing? Trying to make you look like a pedophile. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3647.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Why would I be a pedophile if I know what my dick looks like? The fact that you don't know what your dick looks like makes me think you like kids. Because you look at so many other dicks, you're like, I got them confused. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3657.2400000000002s)]
*  I got no clue what my dick looks like. I don't know. You would only know one dick. You can't remember one? No, not 28 years ago. I remember my dick yesterday, today. What about 10 years ago? It probably looks similar to what it does now. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3670.2s)]
*  When did dicks stop growing? Mine got smaller. It grew back. I think mine grew fat. I think it went back in. Well, it just got fatter. I had to Google it. I was like, I think my dick, I think I got less hand on my dick. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3683.16s)]
*  The thing is, I used to have more hands on my dick and now I have less. So I'm like, is it possible? I literally Googled it, do your dicks get smaller? I asked the doctor. I was like, is it possible your dick gets smaller? [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3695.16s)]
*  I told you. The doctor was like, no, you just gain weight. The last time you heard you were 20 pounds less. So your stomach is growing out and taking some dick away. That's great. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3708.12s)]
*  You talk about you have a little dick all the time. Losing weight would make your dick big. I know. Or do you want to keep your dick at 12? Yeah, I like it at 12, dude. I like it. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3718.12s)]
*  That's what you gotta say. How big is your dick? 12. Just say that. That's it. That's it, man. Okay, so, I don't know. It does get smaller. It does get smaller, right? [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3729.08s)]
*  As you get older, build up a fatty deposits and your arteries reduce blood flow to your penis. Why doesn't it go to your dick? You should get more fat in your dick. They should figure out a way to do that. They do. Fat transfer to your dick. They do. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3740.08s)]
*  You get the BDLs. I mean, if women can get a dick sewn on, you don't think that we can get ours a little bigger? Yeah, that's true. Isn't that crazy? That's a good point, actually. That is a good point. What is the average size of a penis that a woman gets put on? Trans. We should be able to... Trans men. Yeah. We should be able to dictate that. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3751.04s)]
*  Hey. Chosen. Didn't even want to say it, but I did. They should be national average, which I think is... No, if you get to choose, you're going big. No. But that's great. Give them the average. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3772.0s)]

*  What y'all what y'all thought about. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3911.0s)]
*  Even if you're wet. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3913.0s)]
*  What y'all thought about Rosé getting jumped in Vancouver. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3916.0s)]
*  That was wild. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3920.0s)]
*  That was wild. I don't know why he played the song though. I don't know why you playing this. So I was thinking about this. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3922.0s)]
*  Can you explain what happened? Oh yeah. So Rick Ross went to Vancouver and he was doing I guess a show out there. There was like a festival or something he was a part of. And then he played. Not Like Us. Not Like Us. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3928.0s)]
*  And you know some beef ensues. I guess he gets off the stage or whatever. They're backstage. Some people are tussling. He gets swung on and then all his bodyguards get beat the shit out of him and he gets moved to another section. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3939.0s)]
*  DJ got beat up. DJ got fucked up. But here's the question. Okay. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3951.0s)]
*  Rick Ross. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3957.0s)]
*  The immediate question is why would he play Not Like Us? Right? I had that same question. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3960.0s)]
*  He can't not. If he doesn't play it, he's pussy. After talking all this shit about Drake. He got to bare minimum play his diss on Drake. And if he really is the guy he says he is, he got to play the song that you shouldn't play. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3965.0s)]
*  Because he still performs his songs with Drake. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3985.0s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3988.0s)]
*  Those are some of his biggest songs. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3990.0s)]
*  So he has the same set everywhere he goes. Those are still included. So you don't want to get called out by Drake. Be like, you're still using me for a set of songs. So now I got to have a little balance. That's why. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=3992.0s)]
*  Do you think it's really a story if he doesn't play Not Like Us? Like how many people really notice? How big does that story really get? [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4005.0s)]
*  I don't think it's a story and I think you're right about that. But I think his mentality is I'm going to bully him. I'm going to call him white boy. I'm going to say he's corny. I'm going to go into his hood. And then I'm going to do whatever the fuck I want. And I think he wanted the clip of him playing Not Like Us in Canada and nothing happened. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4011.0s)]
*  Of course. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4028.0s)]
*  And something happened. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4029.0s)]
*  But doesn't look bad for him? [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4030.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4032.0s)]
*  His crew got fucked up. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4034.0s)]
*  His crew got destroyed, demolished. He got escorted out just barely. He was hiding behind barricades. This is like I'm Ricky Rose, I'm tough. You're a little bitch, you're a pussy, you're white. He's really talking shit to Drake and it's not even in Toronto. It's in Vancouver. You got snuffed by a white dude. All that white boy talk, you got snuffed by a white dude. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4035.0s)]
*  I know, that's wild. He was tiny kids, I was fucking him up too. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4054.0s)]
*  So I do think it's not a good look. 50 Cent's already on it. 50's already dropping shit. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4059.0s)]
*  50 loves it. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4065.0s)]
*  Oh, he's immediate. He's there. It's incredible. So I do not think it's the best look. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4066.0s)]
*  And Drake's whole weapon this whole time has been humor. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4072.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4076.0s)]
*  Like it hasn't been tough. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4077.0s)]
*  Rick Ross or Drake? [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4078.0s)]
*  Rick. Sorry, I said Drake. Rick Ross' weapon of choice this whole time with Drake in his feud has been humor. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4079.0s)]
*  And it's effective. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4084.0s)]
*  It's being funny. This tough shit, you don't need to do it. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4085.0s)]
*  Also, you know, these guys are huge. You assume they can fight. We don't know that. Get UFC fighting ass bodyguards. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4088.0s)]
*  There was one guy there that was so fucking big, dude. It was unbelievable. He was a mountain. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4094.0s)]
*  The dude that got fucked up? [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4099.0s)]
*  The black guy that got absolutely demolished. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4100.0s)]
*  He got folded. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4101.0s)]
*  I didn't understand what was happening at first. I was like, where's security? And I read it comment, I was like, oh, that's the security. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4102.0s)]
*  I was like, that's not good. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4109.0s)]
*  They usually supposed to just be a deterrent. You see a giant man, you don't want to do anything. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4110.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4115.0s)]
*  But, you know, they're big for a reason. Sometimes they gas out quick. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4116.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4119.0s)]
*  And one time in the gut and might go down. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4120.0s)]
*  The other thing you got to consider is Canada, this whole beef has been basically getting called pussy this whole time. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4122.0s)]
*  They're going to take that away. Even if they are pussy to us, they're going to try to prove to you we're not pussy. Fuck you. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4128.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. They're down bad. They're Lord and Savior. It's like looking funny in the light. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4134.0s)]
*  Apparently, he don't get love in Toronto like he used to at all. But you're just going to keep calling us pussy. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4138.0s)]
*  We've been made a joke of this whole time. Fuck that. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4143.0s)]
*  Even if we don't fuck with him, we're going to. It's like my family. If I'm beefing with my family and you say something about him. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4146.0s)]
*  Well, now let's go. And if he's calling our family pussy, it's on. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4152.0s)]
*  Gotcha. So what do you think happened though? Do you think Drake was like, oh, Ross is going to be in Canada. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4155.0s)]
*  We got to send some people to go make sure he acts right. Or do you think people were just there and they're like, oh, not yet. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4160.0s)]
*  I think the latter. I think I think Drake would send goons, but I don't think those are Drake goons. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4165.0s)]
*  More towards it. First of all. Really? Yeah. Yeah. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4169.0s)]
*  What? Of course. You coming to my scene? It don't even come from Drake even. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4174.0s)]
*  I know. Like I don't think he ever said it. What I think is that the message is out. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4179.0s)]
*  Like, yo, if he if I think if Rick Ross goes there and he just plays his songs and then leaves and he's not disrespectful, probably nothing happens. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4185.0s)]
*  Maybe he gets checked a little. Keep in mind when Pusha T was in Toronto, what happened? They booed him. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4194.0s)]
*  I think they threw the water at the stage. And I think he got like almost attacked on stage. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4199.0s)]
*  Rick Ross had to know this was coming. There's no question. Like this is how it goes down. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4204.0s)]
*  And that's you have to look at Canada like a state. It's not a country. It's a state. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4210.0s)]
*  And if you come to that state and you fuck with the governor, you get touched. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4215.0s)]
*  I think everyone involved in that beef that was against Drake, they'll have problems whenever they go to Canada. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4222.0s)]
*  I'm really curious to see what happens when Weekend goes to Canada. Hmm. Why? I don't know if anything happened. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4228.0s)]
*  The biggest pop artist in the world. Right. Yeah. Oh, I see. I see. I see. But he's intimately involved in this beef with Drake. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4235.0s)]
*  I'm sure he got people that are supporting him in Toronto. And I'm sure that there's people that are supporting Drake. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4242.0s)]
*  And by people, I mean goons on both sides. Yeah. They're going to clash. I think it's neutral. I feel like it cancels out is my guess. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4248.0s)]
*  Nope. You don't think so? There's too much to gain. Like if you're a goon. It's a math, bro. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4255.0s)]
*  Nice. Hamilton. Like, you know Hamilton in the play that I'm going to get my shot. He wants the war because that gives him an opportunity to rise up. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4261.0s)]
*  Yeah. The goons are looking at this like this is my opportunity to rise up. It's my opportunity to shine. Yeah. I don't think Kendrick goes to Canada. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4269.0s)]
*  I think he's just like, we're not. I'm not. I don't even think I even think Kendrick. I'm saying the Canadians. Yeah. This Canadian is going back. Yeah. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4277.0s)]
*  You've got to see your family. The Weeknd was at the show in LA. Right. I don't think he went on, obviously to go on stage, but I believe he was there. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4286.0s)]
*  Here's what I'm like. Drake liking the post and all that. It's like, dude, you're just making this. Like in which post? He liked, apparently Drake liked the post of Rick Ross getting beaten up on somebody's page. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4294.0s)]
*  I like that post. Yeah, but no, no, no, I don't. I don't. The move of it. Sure. That's funny. Do that. But also like you're just escalating things. We saw this play on 96, 97. People died. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4306.0s)]
*  The escalating it, adding fuel to it, making it seem like you co-signed it. I don't think that's a good move because you got to go. And I don't know if Ross is super connected in Miami, but you got to go to Miami. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4317.0s)]
*  Miami looks pussy. You got to go all over California. California is riding for the West super hard. I would just at least act like you, even if you knew don't like shit, don't be public about it. Just fall back and be like, hey man, that's just Canada riding. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4326.0s)]
*  I didn't control that. You got a point. You're throwing fuel on a thing that I don't know you want to throw. And I know Drake rolls heavy with security and they could probably fight better than Ross's security. But why make it harder? Why make it harder? [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4339.0s)]
*  Because you got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4351.0s)]
*  You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4381.0s)]
*  got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. You got to go. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4411.0s)]
*  God help me. I feel like I'm going to pass out of debt all of Canada. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4414.92s)]
*  Like you could actually calculate how much money you're going to lose because of that beef. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4418.02s)]
*  And Cali is one of the wealthier states in terms of amounts of spending power. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4423.16s)]
*  You don't think? [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4427.48s)]
*  California, by itself, [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4428.84s)]
*  meaning if you're Drake, you could go into a [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4433.2s)]
*  arena in LA, an arena in San Francisco, [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4436.16s)]
*  and Sacramento, and inland shit is what like, [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4439.16s)]
*  he won't cut all that off, he'll get the right security, [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4443.16s)]
*  but it is expensive. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4447.16s)]
*  And that security is not cheap. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4449.16s)]
*  And you got houses out there, like, [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4451.16s)]
*  you can't even go. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4453.16s)]
*  And this was, I honestly, look, [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4455.16s)]
*  I loved Kendrick's, all the moves and the beef, [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4457.16s)]
*  but the one thing I was a little worried about was when he said [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4460.16s)]
*  that you think the bagel let you disrespect Pac thing. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4462.16s)]
*  I was like, you're just, this is really asking people to... [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4464.16s)]
*  You know, that was... [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4467.16s)]
*  And I was like, this could go very far left. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4469.16s)]
*  If people don't know, hey, this is all entertainment, [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4472.16s)]
*  there's always idiots out there. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4475.16s)]
*  That's some Taylor Swift shit. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4477.16s)]
*  That was the one thing about it I liked. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4478.16s)]
*  I didn't love that line, and I've supported pretty much every movie made, [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4480.16s)]
*  but that line I didn't love. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4483.16s)]
*  I remember Taylor did that shit to Scooter. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4484.16s)]
*  To Scooter, yeah, yeah. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4486.16s)]
*  Let them know how you feel. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4488.16s)]
*  Let Scooter Braun know how you feel. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4489.16s)]
*  Let Scooter Braun know how you feel. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4491.16s)]
*  You're invoking your audience to go act on your behalf. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4493.16s)]
*  Now, some of your audience, if you have millions of followers, [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4497.16s)]
*  are going to be mentally retarded. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4500.16s)]
*  But they love you so much, they'll do anything for your support. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4503.16s)]
*  They're retarded for you. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4506.16s)]
*  For you. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4507.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4508.16s)]
*  You're their... [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4509.16s)]
*  You're their king. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4512.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4513.16s)]
*  But in a rap beef, why did you guys not like the line? [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4514.16s)]
*  Because I think it's inciting, [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4517.16s)]
*  because I think we love the beef as long as it's not violent. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4518.16s)]
*  No, I think Jay-Z was the best because it didn't get violent as far as we knew. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4521.16s)]
*  Pac and Big, we look at like, fuck, man, people died over that. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4524.16s)]
*  That was so stupid. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4527.16s)]
*  He also doesn't say, you're not going to come to the Bay. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4528.16s)]
*  He says, it's going to be your last stop. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4530.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4532.16s)]
*  You think the Bay can let you disrespect Pac? [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4533.16s)]
*  And you're basically saying, yo, the Bay, you're pussy if you let him disrespect Pac. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4534.16s)]
*  He's basically saying, if you don't do something... [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4541.16s)]
*  I didn't. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4544.16s)]
*  But then he's also calling Drake pussy if he doesn't go to the Bay. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4545.16s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4547.16s)]
*  Oof. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4548.16s)]
*  So it's like... [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4549.16s)]
*  I'm a fan, dude, again, but that fucking line I kept thinking in the back of my mind. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4550.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4555.16s)]
*  I'm a fan. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4556.16s)]
*  I'm a fan. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4557.16s)]
*  I'm a fan. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4558.16s)]
*  I'm a 69 God. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4559.16s)]
*  How did you make that my bully handle? [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4560.16s)]
*  But, fuck, man. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4563.16s)]
*  What are you... [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4565.16s)]
*  That line, I was like, that could escalate things. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4566.16s)]
*  And it seems like this might... [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4568.16s)]
*  I fear this is the domino that starts to escalate. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4570.16s)]
*  And that's why I'm like, Drake, why are you liking this? [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4572.16s)]
*  This is only going to go up from here. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4574.16s)]
*  Cease fire now is what we need. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4576.16s)]
*  Cease fire now, dog. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4577.16s)]
*  I don't want to see nobody die behind me. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4578.16s)]
*  That would be a good song. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4579.16s)]
*  Drake dropped that song. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4580.16s)]
*  Collab, cease fire now, that's what we need. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4581.16s)]
*  Drake need a banger, bro. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4582.16s)]
*  I haven't heard this Camilla one that much. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4583.16s)]
*  It's not outside at all. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4584.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4585.16s)]
*  He dropped a couple so far, and neither one really... [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4586.16s)]
*  I told you, he should just be quiet for a while. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4587.16s)]
*  But I've heard... [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4588.16s)]
*  Chill out for a while. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4589.16s)]
*  I heard this theory. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4590.16s)]
*  I don't know if this is true. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4591.16s)]
*  But apparently, it's possible that he might be contractually obligated to be a part of [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4592.16s)]
*  certain projects as a part of his deal. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4593.16s)]
*  And he has to continue to put out these tracks for a while. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4594.16s)]
*  And he has to continue to put out these tracks for a while. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4595.16s)]
*  And he has to continue to put out these tracks for a while. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4596.16s)]
*  And that is what happens when you're the biggest artist in the world, is that you're [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4608.16s)]
*  not going to just make a song on a whim based on how you feel. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4631.5599999999995s)]
*  Things are scheduled throughout the year. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4634.48s)]

*  That was a thing in the beef where Rick Ross was mad at Drake because Drake apparently didn't [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4664.56s)]
*  allow French to put out a song that he was on. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4670.04s)]
*  And that was one of those things. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4672.88s)]
*  Put out a cease and desist. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4673.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4674.88s)]
*  So he's fucking up the bridge. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4675.88s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4677.88s)]
*  And now Rick is upset. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4678.88s)]
*  Because yeah, I figured that as well where like, Rick don't really give a fuck. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4679.88s)]
*  Like if the money's right, Rick don't care. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4684.120000000001s)]
*  That's what it seems like to me. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4687.120000000001s)]
*  That's one of the ones I really want to know his reasoning for his beef with Drake. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4689.8s)]
*  Because it can't be even the friendship. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4693.56s)]
*  Like it got to be something. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4695.68s)]
*  Well, he represented Meek Mill. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4696.68s)]
*  Meek Mill was his client. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4697.68s)]
*  He manages Meek. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4698.68s)]
*  But he didn't play any sides during the beef. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4699.68s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4700.68s)]
*  He didn't stick up for me. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4701.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4702.68s)]
*  Nobody stuck up. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4703.68s)]
*  And this is honestly what Rick Ross should have done, which is what he did, I think, [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4704.68s)]
*  the day after he dropped the Drake diss is he performed the songs he did with Drake, [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4710.88s)]
*  I think at like a high school prom or some shit and just leaned into the humor. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4714.28s)]
*  If he went to Canada and just leaned into the humor and did all the songs with Drake [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4717.52s)]
*  and then made a joke about it. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4721.040000000001s)]
*  Well, I was saying he still does the songs. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4722.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so just make the joke of it. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4724.4400000000005s)]
*  Put that clip up. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4726.080000000001s)]
*  Got it. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4727.080000000001s)]
*  Hey, Drake, I still need these. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4728.080000000001s)]
*  He's one off humor this whole time. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4729.080000000001s)]
*  You can. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4731.6s)]
*  I know the ego gets there. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4732.6s)]
*  I would have loved it. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4733.6s)]
*  That would have been funny. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4734.6s)]
*  This I'm legit concerned about where this goes. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4736.52s)]
*  I might just be 40. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4738.400000000001s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4740.120000000001s)]
*  No, you're actually speaking facts. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4741.120000000001s)]
*  While we're talking about this music shit, there is a documentary that is on and let [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4743.16s)]
*  me preface this by saying what is the greatest concert I ever said I've been to? [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4750.32s)]
*  Taylor Swift. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4753.639999999999s)]
*  Taylor Swift. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4754.639999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4755.639999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4756.639999999999s)]
*  Greatest concert I've ever been to in my entire life was Taylor Swift. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4757.639999999999s)]
*  I say that Taylor Swift is Michael Jackson today. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4759.639999999999s)]
*  It's a close thing we have to Michael Jackson. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4763.5599999999995s)]
*  Call her mother. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4764.76s)]
*  You call her mother. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4765.76s)]
*  I call her mother. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4766.76s)]
*  Much the ire of the internet. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4767.76s)]
*  I've said that this is the close thing we have to Michael Jackson. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4768.76s)]
*  I'm not a Taylor Swift fan. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4773.04s)]
*  I was not a Taylor Swift fan until I went to that concert and then I saw it and I was [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4774.04s)]
*  like this girl's the truth. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4776.240000000001s)]
*  This is just the most amazing concert I've ever seen. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4778.04s)]
*  There's a documentary on Macs right now that is HBO streaming service. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4781.64s)]
*  And I believe it's only two parts. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4787.0s)]
*  And it is about Taylor Swift, Bad Blood, but Taylor Swift and Scooter Braun. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4789.0s)]
*  Now Scooter is our homie. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4794.4800000000005s)]
*  I just want to point this out. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4796.84s)]
*  Love Scooter. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4798.92s)]
*  I tell him all the time that Taylor is the greatest artist I've ever seen live. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4800.24s)]
*  I've been telling him this for fucking years. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4804.56s)]
*  100%. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4806.68s)]
*  I think he knew this while I was... [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4807.68s)]
*  He knew. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4809.4800000000005s)]
*  He knew. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4810.4800000000005s)]
*  He invested. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4811.4800000000005s)]
*  He agrees. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4812.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4813.4800000000005s)]
*  I watched this documentary. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4814.4800000000005s)]
*  It's a two part documentary. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4817.2s)]
*  One part is Taylor's side, one part is Scooter's side. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4818.28s)]
*  Yes. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4820.16s)]
*  That was cool. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4821.16s)]
*  You said it? [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4822.16s)]
*  I watched it. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4823.16s)]
*  You watched it. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4824.16s)]
*  Okay. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4825.16s)]
*  You guys should all watch this. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4826.16s)]
*  Yes. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4827.16s)]
*  The fact that this document... [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4828.4s)]
*  Keep this in mind. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4829.92s)]
*  Taylor Swift is the biggest artist in history. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4830.92s)]
*  She's factually the biggest artist in history. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4834.44s)]
*  This documentary is almost impossible to find on Macs. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4837.639999999999s)]
*  It's never hit number one on Macs. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4842.88s)]
*  This is... [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4846.32s)]
*  Let me clarify this again. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4847.32s)]
*  Imagine at the height of Michael Jackson's career, a documentary came out on one of the [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4849.599999999999s)]
*  premier streaming services about Michael Jackson and nobody was talking about it. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4854.68s)]
*  Wouldn't you go, what's going on over here? [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4861.68s)]
*  It almost makes you think that there's some information in that documentary that Taylor's [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4864.76s)]
*  team might not want the world to see. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4869.88s)]
*  If you watch this documentary, you will find out that Scooter Braun is a fucking asshole [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4874.4400000000005s)]
*  now. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4882.360000000001s)]
*  You will see that what we think happened and what actually happened between Taylor and [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4884.32s)]
*  Scooter is a world apart. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4894.92s)]
*  She framed a very different narrative than the reality. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4897.92s)]
*  This girl is... [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4901.759999999999s)]
*  She's truly brilliant and she's incredibly genuine. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4904.2s)]
*  Meaning and the power of when someone is genuine is whenever they say something, you believe [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4909.2s)]
*  it to be true. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4915.52s)]
*  When you watch her on interview shows or even on Interview in the Red Carpet, whatever she [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4917.0s)]
*  says in that moment is the most pure, authentic, genuine thing. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4921.7s)]
*  She melts you. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4927.24s)]
*  It's amazing her ability to communicate. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4928.24s)]
*  When you watch her just talking to a single person, you see why she's so endearing and [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4929.96s)]
*  so likable. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4935.52s)]
*  Kanye calls her and asks her kind of for permission to do the song, but it's not even really. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4936.56s)]
*  I think that was actually framed really poorly too. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4941.4800000000005s)]
*  Even the way she's on the phone, she's not on the phone like the biggest artist in the [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4944.76s)]
*  world. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4948.320000000001s)]
*  She's on the phone like a little girl that thinks that she's going to be bullied by her [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4949.320000000001s)]
*  older cousin. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4952.400000000001s)]
*  A shy girl. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4953.400000000001s)]
*  Kanye stole her moment and she's not on stage like yelling, she's just kind of like, oh. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4954.400000000001s)]
*  They asked her after that, how do you feel about that? [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4958.360000000001s)]
*  She was like, oh, wasn't that good? [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4960.200000000001s)]
*  They're like, were you a fan of Kanye West? [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4961.76s)]
*  She goes, yeah, it's Kanye West. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4963.96s)]
*  Now there's a power to that. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4968.04s)]
*  And I also understand like what she represents to women is something that we'll never understand. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4971.76s)]
*  She is petty and women wish they were petty. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4977.6s)]
*  They're not petty to that dude to fuck them over because they still want to get them. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4981.68s)]
*  They're still in love with them. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4985.0s)]
*  They're still heartbroken. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4986.32s)]
*  They wish that he would let her let them back into their lives. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4987.32s)]
*  Not Taylor. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4990.9800000000005s)]
*  Taylor's coming out. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4991.98s)]
*  She's fucking clapping for she's putting the fucking they not like us treatment on every [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4992.98s)]
*  single dude she's with Michael Jordan. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4996.94s)]
*  She remembers everybody that wronged her. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=4999.54s)]
*  And I'm going to fucking destroy you. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5001.66s)]
*  Now, what if I would posit this theory just from watching it and I implore you all to [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5003.74s)]
*  watch this because it paints a very, very different story. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5008.78s)]
*  What if Taylor was really upset at Justin Bieber, Steve Barchetta or Scott Barchetta? [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5014.38s)]
*  Yeah, the guy who was the person who originally owned the record label, Big Machine, Big Machine [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5024.12s)]
*  that that scooter ended up buying. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5030.68s)]
*  What if the beef was with Justin Bieber, Scott Barchetta and Kanye West? [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5033.72s)]
*  The problem with Justin Bieber and Kanye West is they have fan bases, man. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5040.46s)]
*  They have people who ride for them. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5046.68s)]
*  They have people who are ready to go to war, ready to fight, ready to sling death threats, [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5048.68s)]
*  ready to go out there and get active just like Swifties are. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5053.82s)]
*  Believers are out there. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5057.26s)]
*  Kanye fans, as we know, are fucking out there. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5058.26s)]
*  What if the easiest person to make the scapegoat for all of your issues is the person who [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5063.66s)]
*  doesn't have the fan base? [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5069.62s)]
*  What if her ire for Justin and her ire for Kanye all gets funneled into Scooter? [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5072.5199999999995s)]
*  Subconsciously or consciously? [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5081.0199999999995s)]
*  I think that she is a brilliant woman and she's calculating all these things in real [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5082.36s)]
*  time. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5087.78s)]
*  But what would her beef be with Justin? [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5088.78s)]
*  He was dating Selena and she was best friends with Selena and maybe it wasn't going that [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5091.12s)]
*  great with Selena so she was like, you're treating my girl shitty so I got her. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5095.48s)]
*  And also he was antagonistic. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5100.42s)]
*  There's this moment in the doc where I think this has been put all over the world but Justin [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5103.5s)]
*  posted a picture on Instagram of him FaceTiming Kanye Scooter and a DJ named Martin Garrix. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5108.580000000001s)]
*  And he goes, the caption of it is, what's up Taylor? [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5116.18s)]
*  So he's antagonizing. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5119.580000000001s)]
*  What a lot of people don't realize is, and they don't even say this in the doc, that [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5122.06s)]
*  he took from Martin Garrix's Instagram. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5126.64s)]
*  They didn't take the picture, like the idea of the picture wasn't, hey let's antagonize [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5129.56s)]
*  Taylor. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5134.56s)]
*  The idea of the picture was, hey all of us are together, we're boys, let's do it. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5135.56s)]
*  And then he took it from Martin Garrix's Instagram and then used it to antagonize Taylor. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5138.4400000000005s)]
*  Look at it, Justin's the big image. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5141.64s)]
*  So it wasn't him that took it. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5144.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5145.64s)]
*  It was them that screen shotted Justin. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5146.64s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5148.76s)]
*  But he's still antagonizing. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5150.400000000001s)]
*  That doesn't mean anybody screen shotted him. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5151.400000000001s)]
*  Justin is doing the antagonization, but it's not like Scooter, Kanye and Justin are all [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5152.54s)]
*  coming together to antagonize. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5156.54s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5158.5s)]
*  But there's no smoke from Taylor to Justin. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5160.139999999999s)]
*  I don't see the songs about Justin. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5162.66s)]
*  I don't even see that many about Kanye to be honest with you. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5165.94s)]
*  She took some jabs. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5170.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, she took some shots at him. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5171.0199999999995s)]
*  But for as big a thing as she, she took that whole album to a motherfucker she dated for [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5172.0199999999995s)]
*  a week and just lighten jabs to Kanye. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5177.0199999999995s)]
*  She ain't giving no pussy. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5181.08s)]
*  I think she is. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5183.64s)]
*  I like the stare. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5185.68s)]
*  That could be true. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5186.68s)]
*  Is it also possible she's just an incredibly shrewd businesswoman and instead of paying [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5187.68s)]
*  for her masters, which apparently Scooter did offer and there was a negotiation and [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5191.72s)]
*  she didn't love the price, instead of doing all that, you know what I could do for free? [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5195.68s)]
*  Rerecord everything, get my fans to buy it even more by weaponizing victimhood. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5199.88s)]
*  And now not only do I not have to pay hundreds of millions for my masters, I'm going to be [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5204.6s)]
*  a fucking billionaire. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5209.860000000001s)]
*  So 100% yes. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5211.46s)]
*  That move is fire. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5213.46s)]
*  But here's the thing that's really interesting about that move. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5215.82s)]
*  And even the documentary doesn't get this right. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5218.58s)]
*  We even need to go back in the math a little bit. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5220.38s)]
*  So obviously the big dispute is she has this big machine record label. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5221.9400000000005s)]
*  She's been signed with them for like 13 years or something like that. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5225.54s)]
*  She finally is done with her deal and she basically wants to buy her masters back. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5229.34s)]
*  Big machine goes, well, we can do a workout. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5233.66s)]
*  So every new album that you give us will give you one of your old albums masters. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5236.34s)]
*  And they talk about there's also another one where it's a complete buyout and she's like, [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5241.8s)]
*  you know what, I don't want to do that. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5246.360000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5247.92s)]
*  Now there's an important component that's happening during this time that nobody's aware [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5248.92s)]
*  of but I'll tell you guys in a second. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5251.76s)]
*  She goes, I don't want them. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5254.92s)]
*  Matter of fact, it's okay. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5256.360000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5257.84s)]
*  She says she doesn't want her master. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5258.84s)]
*  She doesn't want it. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5260.12s)]
*  There's email correspondence for all this. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5261.12s)]
*  Okay. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5263.08s)]
*  And then my tailor has said throughout this process, I never knew anything. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5264.08s)]
*  No, they didn't even give me the opportunity. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5267.3s)]
*  Her words are on video saying this. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5269.5s)]
*  Is her dad in? [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5271.5s)]
*  While there's, oh, we're going to get to that. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5272.5s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5273.5s)]
*  While there's email correspondence saying otherwise. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5274.5s)]
*  Now her dad, once she signed with this record label, bought a like 3% share of the record [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5276.78s)]
*  label. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5282.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5283.3s)]
*  Okay. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5284.3s)]
*  So he is a shareholder and on the executive board. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5285.34s)]
*  Now in the documentary they say he didn't want to have to lie to his daughter about [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5288.26s)]
*  certain things. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5293.6s)]
*  So he denied opening all the emails. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5294.6s)]
*  He was on the executive board but didn't open the emails. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5297.84s)]
*  But they placed one of the management people from Taylor on the emails. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5299.86s)]
*  So the manager saw it. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5304.64s)]
*  One of that manager guys who was on the team saw every single thing. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5306.04s)]
*  Now once it came out that there was email records of Taylor knowing what was going on [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5309.16s)]
*  and her team knowing what was going on and that was not, that information was not consistent [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5315.0s)]
*  with what Taylor was saying. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5320.1s)]
*  That guy who was on those emails, that manager just so happened to retire. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5321.38s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5325.38s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5326.38s)]
*  Okay. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5327.38s)]
*  Maybe he was tired of his job. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5328.38s)]
*  Maybe he no longer wanted to work for the bigger soliders of all time. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5331.0199999999995s)]
*  Or maybe you get put out to the pasture. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5334.74s)]
*  Who fucking knows? [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5337.299999999999s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5338.299999999999s)]
*  Point is, she decides not to. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5339.299999999999s)]
*  Two ways to buy it out. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5341.54s)]
*  She decides not to. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5342.54s)]
*  She signs to Universal. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5343.54s)]
*  Okay. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5344.54s)]
*  That really pisses off Big Machine. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5345.54s)]
*  Why the fuck would you sign to Universal? [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5347.38s)]
*  I gave you an opportunity to one, buy them or to earn them out. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5349.52s)]
*  And you're going to go sign to Universal. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5352.68s)]
*  Now Universal has made a deal with Taylor that nobody else is aware of. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5354.56s)]
*  And that deal is that they were going to buy the Masters back for her and give it to her. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5359.08s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5365.6s)]
*  Fine. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5366.6s)]
*  This isn't even in the documentary. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5367.6s)]
*  So Universal plans to give her back the Masters. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5369.32s)]
*  That's why she goes to them. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5374.4s)]
*  The guy who was at Universal, Lucian Grange, I believe his name is. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5378.18s)]
*  He signed the biggest artist in history away from Big Machine. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5383.34s)]
*  How do you think that makes Big Machine feel? [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5387.86s)]
*  Pretty salty. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5390.82s)]
*  You think he wants to sell the Masters to Universal? [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5391.82s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5395.5s)]
*  Okay. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5396.5s)]
*  There's this other guy that comes around named Scooter Braun. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5397.5s)]
*  He didn't know any of this. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5400.5s)]
*  He goes, does Taylor want to buy the Masters? [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5402.26s)]
*  Because if she does, I would like her to be involved in this. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5404.86s)]
*  I'm investing in Taylor. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5406.86s)]
*  I want to be involved for business. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5408.14s)]
*  I think she's the biggest fucking thing in the world. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5409.14s)]
*  And what was at the time what was Scooter's relationship with Taylor? [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5411.160000000001s)]
*  Was there any? [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5414.64s)]
*  No. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5415.64s)]
*  She had a little issue with him because he repped Kanye and she took that as a slap in [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5416.64s)]
*  the face apparently. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5419.360000000001s)]
*  Not yet. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5420.360000000001s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5421.360000000001s)]
*  Not yet. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5422.360000000001s)]
*  Oh wow. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5423.360000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5424.360000000001s)]
*  All right, take it back. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5425.360000000001s)]
*  I'm pretty sure the timing isn't even yet. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5426.360000000001s)]
*  I'm pretty sure the timing isn't yet. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5427.360000000001s)]
*  Matter of fact, Scooter didn't rep Kanye until after the famous video comes out. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5428.360000000001s)]
*  Ah, okay. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5433.04s)]
*  So she's upset at Scooter for repping Kanye. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5434.160000000001s)]
*  He didn't even rep until after the famous. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5437.14s)]
*  Now he did promote the video. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5438.42s)]
*  He promoted the art piece which has her in a wax sculpture naked which I think is kind [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5440.18s)]
*  of like someone's, it's a woman's body. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5444.02s)]
*  You can say it's art. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5446.78s)]
*  It's a statement about culture but you can also be like, yo, that's my titties. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5447.78s)]
*  I can see a woman feeling like kind of violated. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5451.66s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5453.38s)]
*  I give her that. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5454.38s)]
*  That's corny. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5455.38s)]
*  Completely. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5456.38s)]
*  But when that call happened with Kim and all them and how they were doubling down and [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5457.38s)]
*  making it look like she was lying, which she wasn't lying, if anything I'd defend the fuck [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5460.94s)]
*  out of Taylor with that. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5464.46s)]
*  She said, I don't know if I'm comfortable with it just yet and then never mentioned [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5465.72s)]
*  the bitch line. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5469.08s)]
*  So she never gave consent. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5470.5s)]
*  She never, she's like, that didn't seem that bad. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5472.12s)]
*  But she never said, yeah, go run with it. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5475.0s)]
*  And then Kim and them tried to make her look like some fucking hypocrite. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5476.639999999999s)]
*  It was some gross shit. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5479.36s)]
*  Yeah, after that. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5480.36s)]
*  It came out after that. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5481.36s)]
*  It was gross. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5482.36s)]
*  Kim lied to her. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5483.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's corny. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5484.36s)]
*  Anyway, Scooter tries to do it. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5486.36s)]
*  Scooter buys the things, fucks up the whole deal from Universal. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5489.44s)]
*  You know who loves the fact that they're fucking over Universal? [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5492.900000000001s)]
*  Big Machine. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5495.86s)]
*  You just bought out, you stole my artist and now you think I'm going to sell you the master [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5496.86s)]
*  so you can make even more money with her? [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5501.42s)]
*  Nah, fuck you. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5502.900000000001s)]
*  I'm going to sell them to this other guy. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5503.900000000001s)]
*  Can I ask you a question? [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5504.900000000001s)]
*  Yes, please. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5506.900000000001s)]
*  It seems kind of like Taylor's made the label, right? [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5507.900000000001s)]
*  Well the label, Scooter bought, he bought the entire label. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5511.22s)]
*  She was for 300 million. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5514.7s)]
*  She was 140 million of it. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5516.5s)]
*  She wasn't even the majority of the label. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5518.78s)]
*  Now he's not buying it if she's not on there. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5520.86s)]
*  She might have been the plurality. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5522.5s)]
*  She is the reason you buy it. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5523.5s)]
*  Keep in mind, there are still 160 million dollars worth of assets on that label. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5525.6s)]
*  So my question is, why wouldn't Big Machine just be like, yo, Taylor, we signed you, you [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5530.08s)]
*  gave us seven amazing albums, we did an amazing job together, just as a sign of good faith, [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5534.28s)]
*  we're going to give you back your masters. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5538.68s)]
*  In my mind, if you're an artist, it's like, yeah, exactly. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5540.8s)]
*  Who gives away 100 million? [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5543.28s)]
*  My question is, if you put in all this time, you're an artist, you make all these songs, [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5544.76s)]
*  why are you not entitled to having your art that you make? [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5548.52s)]
*  Because that's not the business model. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5551.46s)]
*  That is the artist model that we all feel life was that way. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5552.9s)]
*  But that's my point. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5558.219999999999s)]
*  This is public perception. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5559.219999999999s)]
*  People look at this and they go, look, she made the song, she wrote them herself. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5560.219999999999s)]
*  You can see the pen and paper. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5564.26s)]
*  She recorded them with her voice. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5565.34s)]
*  She played all the instruments. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5566.42s)]
*  Why is she not entitled to it? [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5567.58s)]
*  That seems kind of fucked up. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5568.78s)]
*  So I think Dave Portnoy has the best description of this. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5569.9s)]
*  Ironically, I know that he's the biggest Taylor Swift fanny shits on Scooter all the time, [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5573.7s)]
*  but his model is much similar to Scooter's. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5579.200000000001s)]
*  So what he says is, especially with the Call Her Daddy thing, it's like, our business model [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5582.64s)]
*  is to take 20 different bets. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5586.52s)]
*  We bet on 20 different podcasts, maybe one blows, and that's what can pay for all this. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5588.900000000001s)]
*  And that's what record labels do. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5593.240000000001s)]
*  Whether you like it or not, it sucks. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5594.64s)]
*  Once you're the artist that's making all the money, you're like, fuck, I want more fucking [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5596.280000000001s)]
*  money, I completely get this. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5599.360000000001s)]
*  But there's 19 other artists who only eat because you were successful. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5600.8s)]
*  And that is the game. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5604.84s)]
*  And that one pays for the other fucking 19. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5607.3s)]
*  And I don't think people realize that about the music industry. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5609.900000000001s)]
*  It's kind of set up to where nine people don't make it and one person does. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5612.1s)]
*  And so you got to lean on the person that does make it to get back the bet on the other [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5616.66s)]
*  night. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5620.900000000001s)]
*  And that one person that does make it is like, well, I was always going to make it. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5621.900000000001s)]
*  Why the fuck do I have to pay for those other people? [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5624.900000000001s)]
*  Because everyone who makes it believes that they were always going to make it. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5626.900000000001s)]
*  And there was no option. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5630.1s)]
*  Nobody's that surprised by it. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5631.1s)]
*  You dedicate your life to it. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5632.900000000001s)]
*  And Taylor probably would have made it any other way. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5633.900000000001s)]
*  She would have made it no matter what. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5635.56s)]
*  But she happened to make it with them. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5636.76s)]
*  I don't know if you want to bog down the whatever with some of these other facts. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5638.16s)]
*  But some of the things that she says just outright were not true. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5641.96s)]
*  Like she said, Scooter tried to make me sign an NDA if I wanted to buy the masters that [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5644.96s)]
*  I would never publicly defame him. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5650.16s)]
*  I could never criticize him for the rest of my life. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5651.76s)]
*  That's just not true at all. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5654.04s)]
*  The NDA was you can't discuss the deal, which is every NDA that you ever signed. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5655.04s)]
*  Also there's another thing. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5659.16s)]
*  In the documentary they go, not only did Scooter sell the music to this company, because he [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5661.14s)]
*  ended up selling it as well, he also made sure that he would continue to profit on it. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5667.54s)]
*  That's not the case. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5673.94s)]
*  He sold it to this private equity company, Shamrock, that's owned by Disney. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5675.74s)]
*  They were scared because Taylor said she's going to re-release the albums. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5681.24s)]
*  So they're like, we're not going to give you all the money. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5685.74s)]
*  Yeah, this is worth 400 million. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5688.54s)]
*  We're going to give you 330 and you're going to have to earn out the other 70 because if [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5690.74s)]
*  she starts pumping out albums, that's going to kill our profit. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5695.639999999999s)]
*  Scooter goes, I think the more people listen to the new albums, the more they'll listen [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5699.04s)]
*  to the old. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5705.44s)]
*  They'll compare them. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5706.44s)]
*  What is it called? [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5707.44s)]
*  The rising tide lifts all boats. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5708.44s)]
*  And he was right. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5710.84s)]
*  He ends up earning it out. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5712.04s)]
*  But it wasn't, hey, I need to be involved in the upside. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5713.04s)]
*  They were scared to give him market value for the albums because they thought it would [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5715.74s)]
*  be undercut by her re-recording. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5721.44s)]
*  Why did Scooter sell to that company instead of Universal? [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5723.24s)]
*  I think they were probably made the biggest deal. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5728.04s)]
*  One, oh, actually he offered to sell it to Taylor. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5730.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5733.54s)]
*  And then she blackmailed him. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5734.54s)]
*  This is not in the documentary either. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5736.44s)]
*  She didn't blackmail him, but she's basically like, not her, but her team is basically like, [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5738.139999999999s)]
*  sell it at a loss and then she'll stop using all this MeToo language about you. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5743.240000000001s)]
*  Oh, she uses a lot of MeToo language. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5747.4400000000005s)]
*  If you look at it, it's like, I did not give my consent. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5749.84s)]
*  She was using these sexually charged words to describe what's going on. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5752.64s)]
*  And the team, there's email correspondence of all this. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5756.240000000001s)]
*  That's the thing. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5758.64s)]
*  It's like, sell it at a loss and then she'll stop painting you as this bad guy, but only [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5759.64s)]
*  if you sell it at a loss. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5764.4400000000005s)]
*  And he's like, fuck that. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5765.4400000000005s)]
*  You've already painted me as a bad guy. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5766.84s)]
*  You sent all of your fans at me. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5768.64s)]
*  They've given me death threats. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5770.4400000000005s)]
*  They've given my kids death threats. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5771.4400000000005s)]
*  When she said, she said, I never knew about this. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5773.54s)]
*  This happened without my consent. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5776.34s)]
*  Let Scott Barchetta and Scooter Braun know how you feel. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5777.54s)]
*  She knows. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5779.74s)]
*  Matter of fact, in that Kanye phone call, he goes, hey, I want to get your permission [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5780.54s)]
*  because you have an army behind you. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5783.94s)]
*  She's aware. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5785.34s)]
*  She also realizes that Scott Barchetta's name gets no clout. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5786.34s)]
*  So she stops referencing Scott Barchetta and only references Scooter. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5791.94s)]
*  Scott Barchetta is the guy who owned the fucking Masters. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5796.54s)]
*  Now, I understand the frustration of her having her Masters with the guy that represents Justin, [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5800.839999999999s)]
*  who she fucking hates because of Selena. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5809.04s)]
*  And then I guess the Kanye thing would be happening later. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5811.639999999999s)]
*  But still, I understand that frustration. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5814.639999999999s)]
*  It's like this guy owns my work and he represents these two people that I fucking hate. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5817.04s)]
*  And I can't get angry at them because then their fans are going to shit on me and that's [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5821.839999999999s)]
*  going to just be ugly. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5824.839999999999s)]
*  So I'll just get angry at that guy. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5825.639999999999s)]
*  You know what's crazy? [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5827.94s)]
*  I looked up on Twitter after I watched the doc. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5829.34s)]
*  I was like, I just want to see what the comments are. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5831.14s)]
*  So many of the comments are, I just watched a documentary. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5832.54s)]
*  I love Taylor even more. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5835.34s)]
*  Fuck Scooter Braun even more. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5836.34s)]
*  And it's like, oh, Yali is going to live in the reality you want to live in. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5837.54s)]
*  That's an emotional thing. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5840.34s)]
*  And she is brilliant. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5843.64s)]
*  There is nobody. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5845.74s)]
*  This is the brilliance of Taylor Swift. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5846.54s)]
*  You ready? And I love her. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5847.74s)]
*  It was the greatest concert ever. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5848.74s)]
*  Me too. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5849.74s)]
*  This is the genius of Taylor Swift. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5851.34s)]
*  You scared of them Swifties, right? [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5852.94s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5854.34s)]
*  I am. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5855.74s)]
*  You're right. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5856.24s)]
*  This is the genius, right? [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5859.139999999999s)]
*  Has there ever been anyone in history that is a billionaire, the most successful in their [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5860.74s)]
*  field, truly unstoppable, chart-topping success, and also unanimously thought of as a victim? [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5868.139999999999s)]
*  Impossible. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5879.24s)]
*  To manage those two things is masterful. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5880.24s)]
*  I mean, the emotional IQ necessary to have all of your fans still see you as a victim [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5884.94s)]
*  while everybody that has aggrieved you has been punished, thrown to the way inside, fucked up. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5891.94s)]
*  Now, I tell Scooter, I was like... [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5897.44s)]
*  Michael Jackson did it for a little bit. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5899.639999999999s)]
*  Oh, he tried. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5901.04s)]
*  And then... [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5901.639999999999s)]
*  He tried. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5902.04s)]
*  And then... [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5902.639999999999s)]
*  But like, I tell Scooter, I was like, yo, nobody got to feel bad for you. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5903.839999999999s)]
*  You're a billionaire too. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5905.94s)]
*  The fuck can we complain about? [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5907.04s)]
*  Like, you ended up killing it. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5908.339999999999s)]
*  I understand where you're coming from, where you're like, yeah, but like, people think of me, [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5909.639999999999s)]
*  like, as this thing that isn't true. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5913.84s)]
*  Like, there is facts and evidence and emails that shows that she is lying. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5916.34s)]
*  This is not a true thing. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5920.24s)]
*  And people still think of me that way, and that would frustrate the fuck out of me. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5921.639999999999s)]
*  Son, the wife, his ex-wife was saying she was getting phone calls at the house threatening [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5925.139999999999s)]
*  the lives of her and the kids. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5929.44s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5930.84s)]
*  Like, this is not... [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5931.24s)]
*  Yo, I made money. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5932.84s)]
*  That's great. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5933.639999999999s)]
*  You don't have to feel bad for me, but that's fucking crazy. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5934.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5936.94s)]
*  That's right. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5937.639999999999s)]
*  And I don't, like, what's the, what is the Taylor Swift breakup song that's a three-dimensional, [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5938.139999999999s)]
*  we were both at fault, things just didn't work out. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5942.44s)]
*  Sorry about that, man. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5944.639999999999s)]
*  I wish it did. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5945.94s)]
*  Yeah, but that's not art. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5946.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5947.74s)]
*  Yeah, I see your point, but I'm like... [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5948.04s)]
*  That, I mean, yeah. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5949.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I understand your point, but that would be boring. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5949.94s)]
*  Like, where's the rap song where it's like, well, he did have a reason to shoot up my homies, [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5952.94s)]
*  but I have to get my payback. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5958.339999999999s)]
*  That's the rap. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5960.04s)]
*  You want, like, emotionally measured... [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5960.74s)]
*  I mean, what's that, what's that? [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5962.54s)]
*  That good, really screeny rap? [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5963.54s)]
*  What, what, what? [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5964.54s)]
*  Fuck him up! [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5965.839999999999s)]
*  But there's plenty of break-up songs in the life. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5966.839999999999s)]
*  We were too young or whatever, you know what I mean? [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5970.04s)]
*  We were too young, is it? [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5971.84s)]
*  There's songs that are... [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5972.84s)]
*  That's a Drake song. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5973.74s)]
*  ...right there everywhere, yeah. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5974.44s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5975.44s)]
*  The, yeah, it's... [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5976.04s)]
*  You want to, but you understand the point. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5978.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5979.44s)]
*  It does, the art is better this way without a doubt, 100%. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5979.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5984.04s)]
*  But it's just crazy to see, like, Big Machine or whatever has the emails on their website. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5984.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5989.94s)]
*  Like, this proof is there. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5990.24s)]
*  It just shows, like, humans are so emotional, like, we just want you to represent a feeling we have, [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5991.54s)]
*  and then if you don't, we're not even gonna look the other way. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5996.94s)]
*  I bet you... [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=5999.24s)]
*  Taylor and Screwer have never spoken, by the way, since a... [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6001.24s)]
*  They spoke like maybe three times before this, and once shit started to cook, they've never spoken again. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6003.74s)]
*  I bet you. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6007.84s)]
*  My suspicion is... [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6009.139999999999s)]
*  once the narrative is set, you don't want to talk to somebody that could finish, finish five sentences. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6011.94s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, like, you talk to someone that then makes you feel empathy for them and see both sides, [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6021.139999999999s)]
*  you're like, oh, damn, maybe I did overreact a little. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6024.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6026.54s)]
*  No, like, you're making money and have your army going with your narrative, like, don't change it. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6027.24s)]
*  Live in your bubble. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6031.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6032.24s)]
*  Take a game of those. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6032.84s)]
*  House of the Dragon. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6033.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6034.34s)]
*  Did you watch? [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6036.34s)]
*  I've only watched about 30 minutes of the episode. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6037.139999999999s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6039.24s)]
*  Dude, this conversation you're having right now, right at the end. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6039.84s)]
*  I mean, I'm down for you guys, we could talk about it. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6043.04s)]
*  The last thing I was thinking on the Taylor point is that... [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6045.04s)]
*  Say as many as you want. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6046.639999999999s)]
*  I think she really did benefit from being, again, I don't think the Kanye thing made her famous, [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6048.24s)]
*  I think that's obviously not true, [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6052.04s)]
*  but it did thrust her into a national spotlight in the eyes of the American people [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6053.740000000001s)]
*  as someone that could take advantage of as a victim, and that's really, really beneficial. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6058.4400000000005s)]
*  And that has never stopped happening. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6062.240000000001s)]
*  No. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6064.14s)]
*  She is continue, she saw the power. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6064.64s)]
*  And she was a victim there. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6066.04s)]
*  Like, I think what happened was wrong. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6066.9400000000005s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6068.04s)]
*  But being brought into the national spotlight in that way, I think is really beneficial. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6068.64s)]
*  It's funny, I was watching that, I was watching the doc and they talk about what Kanye calls her [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6072.9400000000005s)]
*  and they have this interaction, which is quite charming, and he goes, [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6076.9400000000005s)]
*  he asks her if it's okay if he puts a line in the song. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6082.44s)]
*  And the line of the song that he asks is not, [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6085.339999999999s)]
*  I made that bitch famous. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6088.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6090.44s)]
*  It's, I think Taylor Swift might owe me sex. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6090.839999999999s)]
*  That's the line he asks her, okay? [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6094.54s)]
*  And he sets it up, like, I think you might be upset. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6097.339999999999s)]
*  And then she said, he goes, she goes, is it mean? [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6099.74s)]
*  He goes, no, no, no, just whatever, like, you feel so bad for this girl. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6102.74s)]
*  And then he goes, I think Taylor Swift might owe me sex. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6105.94s)]
*  And she goes, oh, well, that's not that mean. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6107.839999999999s)]
*  She kind of laughs a little, she says, okay, well, I just kind of need to think about it, [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6110.34s)]
*  but I thought it was going to be way worse. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6113.24s)]
*  She doesn't cosign it, but she just thinks about it. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6115.14s)]
*  He doesn't ask her about the, I made that bitch famous. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6117.34s)]
*  Here's the thing, I genuinely believe Kanye believes he made her famous. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6121.04s)]
*  So he's going into that call like, well, this is undisputable. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6129.24s)]
*  I don't need to ask her this line. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6133.4400000000005s)]
*  Like, I made her famous. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6136.4400000000005s)]
*  So that is obvious. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6138.34s)]
*  From a person, if you're not in tune with pop music at all, [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6139.94s)]
*  I wasn't aware of Taylor Swift. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6144.74s)]
*  Until that moment. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6145.94s)]
*  So I'm honestly, like, defensive of Kanye with that, [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6147.54s)]
*  because I bet he was blindsided when he found out she was upset with that. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6153.44s)]
*  He's like, it's like as if Big Sean was like, I can't believe Kanye said he made me famous. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6157.34s)]
*  He'd be like, I didn't make you famous. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6161.94s)]
*  Nobody fucking knew you. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6164.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6165.54s)]
*  Right? [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6166.139999999999s)]
*  So whatever, there's so many of these things, just like every like great controversy. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6167.04s)]
*  There's so much information swirling around and nobody talking to one another. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6171.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6175.24s)]
*  Like you ever like get in an argument with your wife and like, [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6175.54s)]
*  neither of you is saying how a thing that they did made you feel. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6179.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6183.04s)]
*  And then when you reconcile, you're like, oh, you didn't mean it that way? [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6183.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6185.94s)]
*  That's this whole drama. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6187.24s)]
*  Son, you got to get mom and Scooter on the phone, bro. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6189.94s)]
*  The mother, whatever you call her. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6194.54s)]
*  I mean, how awesome would that be? [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6196.04s)]
*  Get them on the phone. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6197.24s)]
*  That's it. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6198.44s)]
*  Convo usually. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6198.84s)]
*  She reached the top. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6199.24s)]
*  There's nothing she can do. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6200.04s)]
*  He reached the top. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6200.84s)]
*  There's nothing more he can do. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6201.64s)]
*  Like what if they had a conversation and just squashed it and she was like, [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6202.54s)]
*  yeah, I shouldn't have told the fans to like, you know, go do that shit to you guys. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6207.74s)]
*  And like I wish that I knew that was her perspective. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6211.74s)]
*  And then Scooter was like, I wish I didn't pump that famous video as much. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6214.04s)]
*  And I, you know, I could see how that made you feel and it was uncomfortable. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6217.24s)]
*  And like I wish that you got back to me about buying the fucking albums. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6220.04s)]
*  Or I wish I knew Universal was planning to buy them in the first place. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6224.24s)]
*  If I knew that maybe I would try to partner with both of you guys on it. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6227.139999999999s)]
*  Like, but once you're set in your narrative, how can Taylor come out and be like, [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6229.639999999999s)]
*  yeah, I was actually just kind of manipulating my fan base to be mean to him [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6233.84s)]
*  and using the Me Too movement. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6236.639999999999s)]
*  I mean, when you say it like that. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6238.44s)]
*  She can never say that. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6239.24s)]
*  You say it like that. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6239.84s)]
*  Yeah, I wouldn't say it like that. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6240.44s)]
*  She can never say it like that. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6241.44s)]
*  I wouldn't say it like that. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6242.24s)]
*  If we're trying to make this call happen, I wouldn't know what to do. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6243.139999999999s)]
*  I wouldn't say it like that. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6245.44s)]
*  But it's crazy. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6247.44s)]
*  Here's the thing about the documentary. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6249.54s)]
*  It kind of is boring, I'll be honest with you. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6251.04s)]

*  The Taylor side is like, they're both like 50 minutes each. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6263.54s)]
*  35 minutes of it is what a great person Taylor is and everybody loves her [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdntz_wNeg&t=6267.04s)]
