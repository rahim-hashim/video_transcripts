# Stylebender’s Fighting Future, Jon Jones Legacy, & Street Fighting
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [November 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o)
*  The guy who's about to fight you right now is on the purest form of fence. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=0.0s)]
*  Like, he's gotta know who you are. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  That's why I pulled up on me. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5.12s)]
*  I had a great morning. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6.08s)]
*  And then this guy, I think because he saw my car, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7.28s)]
*  so he doubled back and just like, is he one outs? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8.96s)]
*  And in New Zealand, that's like, join me one on one, let's go. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  And I started laughing and I was thinking like, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=13.6s)]
*  bro, I fight for millions. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  I'm not gonna knock your ass out for free. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=16.48s)]
*  And he goes, nah, I fight for free. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=17.92s)]
*  I fight for the streets, for my pride. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=19.52s)]
*  And I was thinking, you're stupid. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=21.04s)]
*  You're stupid. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  At the end, you see me spit at him and he just looks down like, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=23.44s)]
*  and then I realized you're not gonna do shit. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=26.0s)]
*  If you spat back at me, then it's on. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=27.6s)]
*  But again, I'm glad I had a good day. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=29.040000000000003s)]
*  I don't like street fights. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=30.48s)]
*  I don't like confrontation. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=31.6s)]
*  But if you bring the problem, then I'm gonna solve the problem. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=32.64s)]
*  I realized this because it happened to Anderson. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=35.2s)]
*  It's happened to Jones. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=37.04s)]
*  It's happened to a lot of the greats. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=38.160000000000004s)]
*  The longer you defend the belt, the less risk you take. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=39.84s)]
*  Do you care about the Strickland fight? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=42.800000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, come on, man. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=44.0s)]
*  Yeah, come on. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=44.56s)]
*  I don't want that back. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=44.8s)]
*  Come on, man. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=45.44s)]
*  I know me and I know where I was during that fight week and all that. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=46.08s)]
*  And again, that was his time. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=49.2s)]
*  It was his week. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=50.16s)]
*  But the whole fight just felt like a weird dream. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=50.8s)]
*  I know I'm gonna be a great dad, but because I've been telling Alex about it before. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=53.04s)]
*  And you can't. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=56.24s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=376.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, no, because I moved to Wanganui as a kid. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=377.52000000000004s)]
*  I was a virgin, good boy, no alcohol, didn't drink, nothing like that. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=381.04s)]
*  But they hanging out with him and our group of friends. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=384.48s)]
*  I was, put it this way. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=387.84000000000003s)]
*  Couple ditty parties? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=389.28000000000003s)]
*  Nah, nah, nah, hell nah. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=390.32s)]
*  No. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=391.12s)]
*  What's up with the freak-o? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=392.08000000000004s)]
*  I was the getaway driver for them doing like mailbox, you know, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=393.68s)]
*  hitting cars, windows, that kind of stuff. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=398.40000000000003s)]
*  Like what, what, 17, 18? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=400.88000000000005s)]
*  And I was always living vicariously through them as they did some. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=402.48s)]
*  New Zealand is really progressive. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=407.28000000000003s)]
*  That's what I was just thinking. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=408.72s)]
*  You would choose the black guy to drive the car. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=409.6s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=411.84000000000003s)]
*  They wouldn't let the black guy near the stairwell [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=413.92s)]
*  because you're getting pulled over immediately. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=416.0s)]
*  We promised we didn't rob anything. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=418.24s)]
*  No, you were just driving black too. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=419.44000000000005s)]
*  Also it was like a soccer mom van, so it was, you know, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=420.96000000000004s)]
*  could fit a lot of people but incognito. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=423.76000000000005s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=425.44000000000005s)]
*  Like fucking Subaru or anything like that. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=426.0s)]
*  But no, yeah, he's good people. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=428.64s)]
*  I like having people like that around me because again, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=430.64s)]
*  I've talked about this now. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=433.36s)]
*  I got this far with just eating the dirty shit, Uber Eats. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=435.36s)]
*  And then now I actually eat whole foods, good meals. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=439.12s)]
*  Like my last flight, I felt great. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=441.92s)]
*  We saw you look shredded. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=442.96s)]
*  I was. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=443.92s)]
*  Also muscle, the wake-up call was easy. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=444.88s)]
*  So yeah, thanks to him. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=447.28s)]
*  And now we're going to just pick up where we left off because- [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=448.48s)]
*  You want it again, huh? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=450.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=452.0s)]
*  You want it bad. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=452.32s)]
*  You had it. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=453.44s)]
*  I thought it was yours easy. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=454.0s)]
*  Yeah, but that's the game though. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=455.44s)]
*  That's how it happens. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=456.64s)]
*  You said you made a small mistake. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=457.28s)]
*  You never spoke on a mistake. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=459.84s)]
*  What was the- [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=461.11999999999995s)]
*  Can you say that? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=462.64s)]
*  So the mistake was just a lapse in focus because I tripped, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=463.44s)]
*  bad footwork and I tripped. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=468.15999999999997s)]
*  And then that was when he was kind of throwing at me and people thought like, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=469.84s)]
*  oh, you heard him. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=472.4s)]
*  And I got up and I was like, the ground. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=473.67999999999995s)]
*  And then DC was like, he's doing the max Holloway. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=475.91999999999996s)]
*  But I'll kind of just be like, nah, the ground. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=478.79999999999995s)]
*  But even that moment right there, I shouldn't have. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=480.47999999999996s)]
*  Just stay focused on the task at hand because you need 30 minutes of focus. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=483.28s)]
*  While you're in there. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=487.76s)]
*  So you can't even just have a lapse in judgment for a split second [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=488.79999999999995s)]
*  because if not, saw can jump on you and capitalize. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=491.76s)]
*  And I've done that to people as well. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=493.76s)]
*  But this guy, I mean, got done to me. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=495.2s)]
*  So wait, what do you mean? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=496.79999999999995s)]
*  You point at the ground and that's when he lunged to you? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=497.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, because again, I was just telling him like, it wasn't you. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=499.59999999999997s)]
*  I tripped. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=502.71999999999997s)]
*  I tripped. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=503.28s)]
*  But he's saying even explaining himself, who gives a fuck? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=503.67999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, just focus on the fight. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=506.23999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, even bro. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=507.44s)]
*  You never see me in a fight, complain to the ref unless like when Brunson really grabbed [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=508.47999999999996s)]
*  my shorts for the second time and I was like, ref, that's wise. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=513.52s)]
*  But you never see me kind of like lose focus. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=515.68s)]
*  I just focus on the task at hand. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=517.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=518.4799999999999s)]
*  But yeah, in that moment, I lost focus and that was it for me at the time. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=519.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=522.56s)]
*  Outside of that, anything surprising like? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=523.04s)]
*  Nah, because I, you know, the strength was something that was always so much this, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=525.68s)]
*  so much that, but I felt strong in there. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=528.64s)]
*  Again, shout out Matt. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=530.4799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=531.4399999999999s)]
*  So I felt really strong. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=531.76s)]
*  I felt fast. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=532.9599999999999s)]
*  If you do the numbers, like my guy Bill Smart did the numbers and said that was the most [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=535.92s)]
*  active I've ever been in any of my fights in the UFC. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=540.0s)]
*  Yeah, it felt like the pace was high. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=542.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=544.56s)]
*  So I was putting the pace on him. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=544.9599999999999s)]
*  So again, you know, took time off, came back, felt great. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=546.2399999999999s)]
*  That's the main thing. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=550.3199999999999s)]
*  I felt great when I was fighting. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=551.04s)]
*  So now we're going to build. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=552.4s)]
*  We did my testing about four weeks ago now, three weeks ago. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=553.8399999999999s)]
*  So we've got the numbers and we're like, cool, we are where we were four weeks out from the [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=557.52s)]
*  fight. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=561.76s)]
*  So it's like, cool, let's build off from that. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=562.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=564.16s)]
*  I'm going to build off. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=564.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=565.1999999999999s)]
*  So what do you want? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=565.3599999999999s)]
*  Like, what is your ideal next couple of years? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=566.3199999999999s)]
*  If everything goes the way? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=568.3199999999999s)]
*  I actually have no idea. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=570.0s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=571.1199999999999s)]
*  And it's nice to know that. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=571.5999999999999s)]
*  And I was even telling Rogues this. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=572.96s)]
*  I've never felt that when people talk about say, you know, I lost the belt. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=575.6s)]
*  Like Matt Hughes was one of the first people I heard. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=578.64s)]
*  Who's my chef's name, by the way, Matt Hughes. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=581.0400000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=582.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=583.2800000000001s)]
*  But Matt Hughes, the legend UFC icon was the first one I heard talk about when he lost the [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=583.6s)]
*  belt. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=587.6s)]
*  He felt this pressure come off like, oh, I'm not the champ anymore. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=588.0s)]
*  But I'd never felt that because I was the champ for so long. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=591.84s)]
*  And then when I lost it in MSG, it was kind of like, fuck, let's do it again. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=594.1600000000001s)]
*  And then it wasn't until even when I lost to the Strickland, I still felt like, you know, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=599.44s)]
*  that target on my back and it still is. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=603.36s)]
*  But after this fight, I was kind of like, well, meh. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=605.6800000000001s)]
*  Like I wasn't attached to the result. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=609.0400000000001s)]
*  I just wanted to show off. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=610.8000000000001s)]
*  I wanted to fight. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=611.7600000000001s)]
*  And I did. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=612.72s)]
*  So now I'm in a spot where it's like, who do I fight? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=613.9200000000001s)]
*  When do I fight? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=618.24s)]
*  Because I'm only doing main events, five rounders and title fights. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=620.08s)]
*  That's all I've done for the last how many years. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=623.9200000000001s)]
*  It's kind of nice to just not have that be the focus now, but now just fight, show off, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=626.16s)]
*  make money. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=632.64s)]
*  But we'll see. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=633.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm excited. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=634.88s)]
*  Where do you get the motivation now? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=637.52s)]
*  You've beaten everybody. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=639.84s)]
*  You've become the biggest star in the sports. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=642.56s)]
*  You've made all the money. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=645.12s)]
*  You've taken care of, I imagine. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=646.48s)]
*  We need more. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=650.0799999999999s)]
*  See, that's the thing. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=651.3599999999999s)]
*  It always gets better. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=652.0799999999999s)]
*  The whole always gets better. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=653.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, no matter what. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=655.5999999999999s)]
*  Right? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=656.8s)]
*  You buy one car, you like that other car is nice too. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=656.9599999999999s)]
*  Once the lifestyle steps up, there's other things you want. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=659.5999999999999s)]
*  But you've made enough money where like you're good. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=661.52s)]
*  Your family's good. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=664.4799999999999s)]
*  Everything is good. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=665.3599999999999s)]
*  And you've achieved, I imagine, all the dreams you had when you were younger within UFC. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=667.4399999999999s)]
*  Is there this moment where, and I'm asking because there's like a thing that I kind of [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=674.3199999999999s)]
*  relate to in my sphere of work, but it's like, is there's a moment where you have to decide [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=679.76s)]
*  to make new dreams to get yourself up every day to put in the work to achieve what you achieved? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=684.08s)]
*  I haven't said even getting a submission right now would be meaningful to me more than getting [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=692.48s)]
*  a belt for the third time. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=699.12s)]
*  So that's the thing. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=700.16s)]
*  It's like you have to find things you haven't done yet. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=700.72s)]
*  Because you always said from the beginning, the first time that we had you on, you were like, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=703.68s)]
*  I don't care about the belt. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=708.72s)]
*  The belt doesn't define me. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=710.08s)]
*  Now, I'm sure it's nice to have the fucking belt. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=712.0s)]
*  Oh, it's nice. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=713.9200000000001s)]
*  To wear a crown, it's fucking whatever. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=714.88s)]
*  I got a couple at home. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=716.72s)]
*  They just sit there. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=717.6800000000001s)]
*  They don't go away. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=718.32s)]
*  But yeah, so that's why when you say right now, like I didn't really care about the belt, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=719.84s)]
*  I believe you. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=722.96s)]
*  Yeah, because I said it from the jump and I'm glad you remember that. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=723.6800000000001s)]
*  But now it's just, again, highlights, cool shit. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=726.24s)]
*  Like again, when I was fighting, I realized this because it happened to Anderson, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=729.52s)]
*  it's happened to Jones, it's happened to a lot of the greats. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=734.08s)]
*  The longer you defend the belt, the... [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=737.76s)]
*  I'm not speaking for those guys, of course, saying the longer you defend the belt, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=743.12s)]
*  the less risk you take. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=746.7199999999999s)]
*  Because you see the way I was fighting, one of the examples I gave was my Brad Tavares fight, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=748.8s)]
*  you know, in the round one. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=753.8399999999999s)]
*  Cool. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=756.0799999999999s)]
*  I hear the clapper, 10 seconds left. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=756.7199999999999s)]
*  I said, I'm going to try. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=759.76s)]
*  I'm in Nari roll. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=760.56s)]
*  I landed in training quite a lot, but I've never ever tried it in a fight. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=761.68s)]
*  So I was like, let me try that shit. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=765.04s)]
*  Did it, just missed because my hips weren't high enough. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=766.5600000000001s)]
*  And then I got up and I was like, come on. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=769.9200000000001s)]
*  But again, shit like that. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=772.32s)]
*  When you have the belt longer, you stop doing that. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=775.04s)]
*  It's not just about me. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=777.9200000000001s)]
*  I got to defend the belt. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=778.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's not just about me. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=779.52s)]
*  It's about, you know, when I win and I have the belt, there's a lot of people that eat. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=780.5600000000001s)]
*  So, you know, it just slowly... [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=785.52s)]
*  And it's not on purpose. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=787.44s)]
*  It's something that just happens, like I said, with Sylvia, I've seen it as a fan [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=788.72s)]
*  and with Jones as well, I've seen it. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=792.0s)]
*  But then now I'm kind of free of that. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=793.6800000000001s)]
*  I'm just like, I know I'm good and all that. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=795.52s)]
*  So I just want to go back to just taking more risks, being fun, being a highlight. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=799.36s)]
*  Do you like it? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=803.52s)]
*  Did it get less fun as you have the belt longer and longer? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=803.92s)]
*  Certain fights, there was one Marvin Vittori part two, when I was in there, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=806.56s)]
*  maybe round three, and you hear, I don't know if it's on the fight, but I heard Twister, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=809.68s)]
*  one of my coaches was like, don't get bored, Izzy. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=813.76s)]
*  And I caught myself like, oh yeah. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=818.16s)]
*  But again, I didn't realize it because I'm in the fight, but he saw it in my eyes, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=819.68s)]
*  in my demeanor, like... [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=822.8s)]
*  It was a very dominant performance. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=823.92s)]
*  He could see it though. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=826.16s)]
*  And maybe around three or four, he could just see it, I was just like, this is boring for him. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=826.9599999999999s)]
*  That seems like the beginning of starting to like, not lose it, but starting to be like, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=830.24s)]
*  oh shit, it's coming down the road, he might lose. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=835.36s)]
*  This one, it's still easy, but that means you're probably not going to train quite as [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=837.4399999999999s)]
*  hard for the next fight. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=840.7199999999999s)]
*  And then if you win that one, you can train even less hard for the next fight. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=841.68s)]
*  And eventually, it will catch up to you. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=844.0s)]
*  You never got a road rage knockout? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=846.0799999999999s)]
*  You want to talk about highlights? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=848.08s)]
*  So when I saw you square up, I was like, the guy who's about to fight you right now is on the [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=849.2800000000001s)]
*  purest form of fentanyl because there's no way, like he's got to know who you are. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=854.08s)]
*  Fine. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=858.72s)]
*  That's why I pulled up on me. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=859.2800000000001s)]
*  So I had a great morning training. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=860.4000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=862.48s)]
*  What's the story? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=863.0400000000001s)]
*  You had a delicious breakfast. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=863.9200000000001s)]
*  Matt, you just made a delicious breakfast. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=865.12s)]
*  Yeah, no, no. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=866.72s)]
*  Matt was, I think he was in Thailand at the time. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=867.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=869.5200000000001s)]
*  So I had good morning training, vibes was on, went to the gym, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=870.08s)]
*  so I had good morning training, vibes was on, went to K Road to get this pie, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=874.8s)]
*  like a famous pie on there. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=881.04s)]
*  And I was just like, vibes was on, just chilling. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=882.0799999999999s)]
*  And then this guy, I think because he saw my car, so he doubled back and just like, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=884.8s)]
*  look at him, like, is he one outs? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=888.0s)]
*  And in New Zealand, that's like one outs is like you and me one on one, let's go. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=890.0799999999999s)]
*  What? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=894.3199999999999s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=895.12s)]
*  What? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=896.0799999999999s)]
*  And I started laughing and I was thinking like, the fuck? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=896.88s)]
*  And people who were taking photos with me and stuff were like, the fuck? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=899.4399999999999s)]
*  And I just kept on walking. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=902.24s)]
*  And then the bit where it pissed him off, because he was at the green light, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=903.92s)]
*  everyone going around him, honking their horns like this fucking guy. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=907.28s)]
*  And then I went, I just grabbed my car door and I went, and that pissed him off. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=911.28s)]
*  So he just came in front of my car and I said, bro, I'm not going to fucking whoop. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=916.0s)]
*  Why'd they piss him off? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=919.52s)]
*  Just because you flexed in the golf course? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=920.5600000000001s)]
*  My car door does the scissors. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=922.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=923.2s)]
*  If a guy just walks up to you, he's like, yo, let's shoot the fair one. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=925.6800000000001s)]
*  And you're like, bro, my car does this. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=927.92s)]
*  That's what they call suicide doors. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=929.92s)]
*  You're trying to fucking end it. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=936.64s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=937.76s)]
*  No, but then he pulled up and then tried to talk all this rast to me. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=938.4799999999999s)]
*  And at one point, I even tried to defuse it because I was like, bro, I don't know you. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=942.7199999999999s)]
*  What's the craziest thing he said? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=945.8399999999999s)]
*  When I said, bro, I fight for millions. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=949.04s)]
*  I don't fucking fight. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=950.88s)]
*  I'm not going to knock your ass out for free. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=951.76s)]
*  And he goes, no, I fight for free. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=953.68s)]
*  I fight for the streets, for my pride. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=955.36s)]
*  And I was thinking, you're fucking stupid. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=956.88s)]
*  You're stupid. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=958.3199999999999s)]
*  Was he a white guy? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=959.6s)]
*  No, a Maori guy. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=960.4s)]
*  He was brown. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=961.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=962.24s)]
*  See, that's the problem I had when I first moved to New Zealand. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=962.72s)]
*  I couldn't tell the difference between all of them. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=964.72s)]
*  It wasn't because of races. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=966.64s)]
*  So you went to China. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=967.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=969.12s)]
*  Hard mode. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=972.08s)]
*  I mentioned I got there. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=974.72s)]
*  You put it on all starts. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=975.6s)]
*  No, but then in the end, I just, as when I sped at him was when I was kind of like hoping, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=978.96s)]
*  try something. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=982.88s)]
*  At the end, you see me spitting at him and he just looks down like, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=984.64s)]
*  and then I realized you're not going to do shit. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=987.28s)]
*  But also, because of our boy, like you remember the movie when our boy got knocked out? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=988.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=993.4399999999999s)]
*  Street violence. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=994.0s)]
*  And I just realized if I drop this guy right now, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=994.8s)]
*  And he dies. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=997.04s)]
*  Boom. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=998.08s)]
*  They're going to fucking put me through the ring. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=998.64s)]
*  These are weapons now. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1000.88s)]
*  Oh yeah, they're being weapons. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1001.84s)]
*  So for me, I was just like, nah, just, and again, we started a charity, Walk Without Fear, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1003.2s)]
*  to help with this kind of senseless street violence. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1006.96s)]
*  Because a lot of these guys, the boys that killed my boy, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1009.52s)]
*  they did home detention for I think a year and a half. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1014.88s)]
*  And during that year and a half, we all had lockdown for six months in that time. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1017.44s)]
*  So again, we all did it together. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1021.9200000000001s)]
*  So what's the, and now they're around free with your family. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1023.6s)]
*  So basically, you're like, we also had home detention. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1026.16s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1027.68s)]
*  So again, we're trying to change the laws with that charity. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1028.64s)]
*  And this video, I believe, will help because it shows the discipline of someone like me. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1030.8s)]
*  Do that to Dan Hooker. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1037.2s)]
*  Dan is- [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1038.8s)]
*  Like Dan is a beast and Dan would probably act differently and maybe not knock him out, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1040.0s)]
*  but just put him to sleep, hang him out. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1044.48s)]
*  But still. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1046.32s)]
*  How does the video end? [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1047.52s)]
*  Because it's like, it seems like it was still going on. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1048.8s)]
*  If you go to the end, you'll see me just spit at him. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1051.84s)]
*  And then when I slammed my car door down, I was kind of just like- [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1053.9199999999998s)]
*  That's when you were, that's when you got pissed? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1057.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. But when I was driving off, he had a shirt off and he was still flexing. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1059.6799999999998s)]
*  And again, people, only one person, like when I said, can you call the cops? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1063.4399999999998s)]
*  One person helped me. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1068.0s)]
*  Everyone else just had the camera off at this moment. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1069.04s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1071.12s)]
*  So you see me spit at him, then he looks down. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1071.6s)]
*  And I go angry, but then- [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1073.9199999999998s)]
*  Now what's happening right now? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1075.12s)]
*  He just didn't do shit. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1076.7199999999998s)]
*  But what are you thinking right now? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1078.1599999999999s)]
*  I was like, I spat at you on your leg. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1079.6799999999998s)]
*  If he spat back at me, then it's on. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1081.9199999999998s)]
*  But again, I'm glad I had a good day and I don't like street fights. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1084.32s)]
*  I don't like confrontation, but if you bring the problem, then I'm going to solve the problem. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1089.28s)]
*  Okay. Real quick. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1094.32s)]
*  So in this moment, you're thinking, all right, do I knock this guy out? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1095.04s)]
*  If I knock him out, does he die? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1100.56s)]
*  Is there ever a thought, like the average person would go, what if this guy knocks me out? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1102.96s)]
*  Do you eat? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1108.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1108.56s)]
*  Most of us when we think of damn, I'm about to get knocked out. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1114.88s)]
*  I just put my pies in the car, took my watch off and I was just like, look, if he breaches [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1120.32s)]
*  the range, because I'm within my rights and he's within range. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1125.2s)]
*  Well, I was just thinking of a foul. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1127.92s)]
*  I was just like, man, if he hits his head, because it's downhill, it's more gravity. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1129.28s)]
*  He's going to bleed out and I probably wouldn't be here right now. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1134.32s)]
*  I want that type of confidence to be worried about killing me on the person. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1137.44s)]
*  I was just thinking of following the charity and him dying. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1142.96s)]
*  What if you just slapped him and got another Dana White contract? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1144.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1147.2s)]
*  What if you just slapped him in his face, saw what happened and you joined a different Dana White league? [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1147.68s)]
*  I told him I was getting paid millions to fight. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1153.04s)]
*  If you're not getting paid like that to fight. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1155.3600000000001s)]
*  Why haven't any UFC guys or boxing guys entered that? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1158.48s)]
*  Paige Van Zandt did. She's doing her second fight soon, I think. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1162.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1165.04s)]
*  Yeah, she has, but she's crazy. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1165.52s)]
*  I'm saying like guys that are no longer professional. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1168.08s)]
*  For women. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1170.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1170.72s)]
*  We need like some big Puerto Rican lesbian. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1174.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1176.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1177.28s)]
*  That's oh wow. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1177.76s)]
*  Yeah, you close. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1178.96s)]
*  But these, yeah, you should go house slap too. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1180.96s)]
*  I'm not doing that. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1183.44s)]
*  I'm not doing that. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1185.76s)]
*  That's actually sore. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1187.04s)]
*  Put your hands as well. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1188.8s)]
*  Do you think his motivation was just trying to get paid? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1190.56s)]
*  Because we don't have those laws in New Zealand. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1192.8s)]
*  I think in his head, again, he's not caring about pay because he fights for the streets, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1195.52s)]
*  fights for his pride. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1199.76s)]
*  But the guy filming kept on going. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1201.12s)]
*  To you or to him? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1204.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1205.52s)]
*  So I don't know. It feels like it was a setup. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1205.92s)]
*  The Life Tour, last show. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1207.84s)]

*  That's disgusting. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1707.16s)]
*  They have feelings, you know, they want to be spoken to and cared about. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1708.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1712.16s)]

*  Exactly. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1730.16s)]
*  That is his fucking cup of tea. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1731.16s)]

*  They might actually, he says that. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1740.16s)]

*  Well, at least you're not racist like Miles. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1752.16s)]
*  I'm not even in the... [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1755.16s)]
*  No, I'm just joking, but not at all. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1758.16s)]
*  Miles went home, he had no electricity, he goes, I don't know how people live like this. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1761.16s)]
*  We're like, who are you talking about, dude? [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1765.16s)]
*  Wait, what happened? [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1768.16s)]
*  When was this? [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1769.16s)]
*  I was like, I don't know. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1770.16s)]
*  I flew home to go see my parents and then hurricane Florida. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1771.16s)]
*  And then a hurricane hit us. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1774.16s)]
*  I think they say like fucking South Africa or something crazy. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1775.16s)]
*  Dude, that'd be so sick. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1777.16s)]

*  How cool? [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1779.16s)]
*  Why? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1780.16s)]
*  Because they impressed black people. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1781.16s)]
*  I just wanted to be not... [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1782.16s)]
*  He can never not say this thing. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1783.16s)]
*  It's actually a really funny character. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1784.16s)]
*  Like a not racist person, but that just goes every single time. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1785.16s)]
*  Accidentally goes racist. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1788.16s)]
*  Yeah, you would like that. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1789.16s)]
*  I think it's funny. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1790.16s)]
*  I think it's funny. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1791.16s)]
*  I think it's funny. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1792.16s)]
*  I think it's funny. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1793.16s)]
*  I think it's funny. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1794.16s)]
*  I think it's funny. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1795.16s)]
*  I think it's funny. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1796.16s)]
*  I think it's funny. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1797.16s)]
*  I think it's funny. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1798.16s)]
*  Yeah, you would like that. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1800.16s)]
*  Yeah, sorry. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1802.16s)]
*  Dude, way to bring up fucking South Africa, man. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1803.16s)]
*  Come on, dude. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1805.16s)]
*  That's my peoples, man. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1806.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's your peoples. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1807.16s)]
*  Are you and him cool? [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1808.16s)]
*  Yeah, we're cool. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1809.16s)]
*  After the fight, we had a nice discussion. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1810.16s)]
*  It was cool. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1812.16s)]
*  Was that a private thing or did you share that? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1813.16s)]
*  You keep it private. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1815.16s)]
*  It was cool. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1816.16s)]
*  Just like a moment. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1817.16s)]
*  And at the end, he just said, if you're ever in South Africa, you know, tap in. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1818.16s)]
*  I was like, yeah, sure. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1822.16s)]
*  And I said, when we see again, I'll try and kill you. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1823.16s)]
*  And he goes, I'll try and kill you too. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1824.16s)]
*  And we hugged. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1826.16s)]
*  And I did this shit. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1827.16s)]
*  And he was like, I'm not beating those allegations because I went, hey. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1828.16s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1831.16s)]
*  He laughed and then just like, we just hugged and that was it. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1833.16s)]
*  I thought it was a good moment between you guys. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1835.16s)]
*  He seems like the textbook troll where he will talk all kinds of shit before the fight [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1837.16s)]
*  and then after the fight, the most humble, nice. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1840.16s)]
*  That's how most fighters are. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1842.16s)]
*  There's only some who take it to that place and then like keep it like that after the fight. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1844.16s)]
*  But nah, we're all on the same journey. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1847.16s)]
*  And again, he's achieved his dream now. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1850.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1852.16s)]
*  I know what I even was the reason when I saw was Marab in Georgia when they're hailing him. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1853.16s)]
*  Oh, man, that was crazy. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1860.16s)]
*  So whenever I see that, no matter what, it makes me feel aware because I'm like, yo, I know that feeling. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1861.16s)]
*  Yeah, I've done that too. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1867.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1868.16s)]
*  So it's it's yeah, you can. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1869.16s)]
*  If I hate on that, what does that say about me? [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1870.16s)]
*  100 percent. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1872.16s)]
*  Yeah. So I always respect. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1873.16s)]
*  Sorry. Do you find yourself I know before the fight, you're saying like, this is real. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1874.16s)]
*  Do you find yourself having to get to that place and like build up to that place? [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1878.16s)]
*  Or is it doesn't get harder as you get more successful to find that extra gear? [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1882.16s)]
*  Kind of what we talked about earlier, but to find that, you know what? [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1886.16s)]
*  I need to hate this guy because then I'm going to lock in like I used to lock in. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1888.16s)]
*  Nah, it can't be. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1892.16s)]
*  That was real. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1894.16s)]
*  But it doesn't get harder unless, say, like Jeff had my friend had this stats in. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1895.16s)]
*  Like whenever you fight someone, you don't really have any static. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1903.16s)]
*  You fight different, even if you beat them. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1905.16s)]
*  But whatever I have beef with someone, I now I now let them normally. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1907.16s)]
*  So, yeah, as I get older and I'm thinking about it, I'm like, I might have to tap into something else just to get that or not fight from that place. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1911.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's you know what I mean? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1921.16s)]
*  There's a ceiling on that kind of like there's only so much. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1922.16s)]
*  But not everybody can fight from a different place. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1925.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1927.16s)]
*  Like you fight from one place your entire life. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1928.16s)]
*  That is your motivation. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1930.16s)]
*  And then you get to you get to a time in your life where like you feel really achieved, like that giant hole that you have. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1932.16s)]
*  Oh, still there. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1940.16s)]
*  Yeah, but. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1941.16s)]
*  What's less big. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1942.16s)]
*  Is he knowing you for the last however long we've known each other? [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1943.16s)]
*  Five years or something like that? [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1946.16s)]
*  Longer even. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1947.16s)]
*  Your level of confidence in yourself. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1948.16s)]
*  I think people always assumed you were the most confident person. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1952.16s)]
*  And even now, seeing the way that you've handled that, like this loss, like to me, that's the demonstration of confidence. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1955.16s)]
*  That's real confidence. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1963.16s)]
*  Because if you lose and then you're completely wiped out, that means that your confidence and identity is wrapped in being the victor. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1964.16s)]
*  And we will not always be the victor in life. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1971.16s)]
*  So whatever that lady in the Winnebago is telling you. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1973.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, she's right. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1975.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1977.16s)]
*  So, again, we talked about it as well. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1978.16s)]
*  Talk about and I use the avatar Zuko, the firebender, when he became friends with Ang and then they had to he had to find a new way to fireman because he didn't have the anger anymore. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1980.16s)]
*  They met the original firebenders, the dragons, and they relearned firebending. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1990.16s)]
*  So for me, that's one of the main reasons I haven't even been to the jungles yet, because I just know that it's not my whole feel, but I like having that. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=1993.16s)]
*  I'm going to fucking show you. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2005.16s)]
*  You fucking kidding me? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2007.16s)]
*  I like the chip. The chip is a great motivation. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2008.16s)]
*  He always brings out Bernard Hopkins. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2010.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2011.16s)]
*  On who? [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2012.16s)]
*  Bernard Hopkins? [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2013.16s)]
*  He always brings out Bernard Hopkins. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2014.16s)]
*  Bernard was a perfect example of that. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2015.16s)]
*  Like when he was the heel, he was unstoppable. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2016.16s)]
*  And then sometimes the heel becomes a face. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2018.16s)]
*  And I think that he was less effective as a face. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2021.16s)]
*  Like when we were all rooting for him, I think it was he just didn't know what to do with it. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2024.16s)]
*  When he was taking the Puerto Rican flag in Puerto Rico and ripping and stepping on it, he was unstoppable. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2029.16s)]
*  And we were all stranded at. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2034.16s)]
*  It's a peculiar thing that only you guys really understand. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2036.16s)]
*  I mean, we all understand in our own ways, but where we're fighting because of what we have to do, even I won't say the name, but someone in the game who has done what I've done, even achieved greater heights, said, yeah, don't do it until after fighting. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2041.16s)]
*  What's that? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2055.16s)]
*  Go to the jungles or like tap into those plant medicines until after fighting. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2056.16s)]
*  Because it's going to... [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2060.16s)]
*  Yeah, he felt like it changed him a little bit. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2061.16s)]
*  Even like what Deontay Waldo was talking about, he went to Peru, I think. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2063.16s)]
*  The ayahuasca? [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2068.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2069.16s)]
*  And then allegedly people have said now he hasn't fought. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2070.16s)]
*  Even he said it after his post fight recently. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2073.16s)]
*  He said, yeah, I found inner peace or something like that. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2075.16s)]
*  And then people say that's taking away that because, bro, he was the guy knocking out everybody left, right in the center, the highest KO ratio in boxing. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2078.16s)]
*  But again, I think it's just finding a different place to fight for him, even if you've done that, because people have done it and been successful. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2086.16s)]
*  But these levels... [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2092.16s)]
*  Even Bernard Hodgson did it. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2093.16s)]
*  He ended up finding... he became champion like 50 or something. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2095.16s)]
*  Well, I think what he did is he became the underdog again. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2100.16s)]
*  Oh, he did? [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2103.16s)]
*  When he was fighting as an old man. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2104.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2106.16s)]
*  Right? [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2107.16s)]
*  So like while he might have been the face, it was still like nobody believes in me. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2108.16s)]
*  Nobody believes I can do it because I'm so old and I'm going to prove you wrong. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2110.16s)]
*  I hate it being the favorite at some point because some people I'm like, why you still have me as the favorite? [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2114.16s)]
*  Even in the second Alex Penetra fight, I was like, I'm the favorite still? [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2118.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2122.16s)]
*  I'm like, bro, I didn't like it. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2123.16s)]
*  So I do like... it's not the whole feel. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2125.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2128.16s)]
*  Because again, I do tap in with love, the people that really show me love, the people that are around me, the messages I get. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2129.16s)]
*  Some of the messages I get, man, I'm just like, bro, you don't even know me, but you know me. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2134.16s)]
*  And it fills me with joy and it fills me with pride. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2139.16s)]
*  And those are the people I fight for when I tap into that. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2142.16s)]
*  But also the ones that don't believe in me and say, oh, this shit, I'm like, I'm going to fucking show you because I like that. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2145.16s)]
*  But I don't know how long that's going to last for. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2151.16s)]
*  So again, finding new spots to fight for. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2153.16s)]
*  And yeah, we'll see. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2156.16s)]
*  Even train for them. I'm going to try it out. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2158.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2159.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2160.16s)]
*  We're transferring that to something else. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2161.16s)]
*  I mean, it's, you know, it's on some level, probably an addiction. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2163.16s)]
*  You see some people like they quit drinking and become like workout a whole. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2166.16s)]
*  Yeah, find something else. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2170.16s)]
*  But you can't just go. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2171.16s)]
*  Well, a lot of people just can't go cold turkey in life. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2172.16s)]
*  Like you need to fill that, you know, sitting around. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2175.16s)]
*  That's me after fighting. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2177.16s)]
*  I was saying this to Joe as well after fighting. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2178.16s)]
*  And that's why I say now who knows what's going to happen after fighting. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2181.16s)]
*  But I say I would need something to do every few months. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2184.16s)]
*  That'll make me feel like I'm about to die. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2188.16s)]
*  So one of the things is like, say I'll train for three months or two months and then cool, let's go running with the Bulls. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2190.16s)]
*  But I'll train for two months on how to run with the Bulls. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2195.16s)]
*  Do it with maybe some sheep first. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2198.16s)]
*  We've got heaps of sheep in New Zealand. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2199.16s)]
*  Like fucking run with the sheep or whatever. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2200.16s)]
*  And then eventually, because that would just get me up. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2203.16s)]
*  That would make me feel like fuck. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2206.16s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2208.16s)]
*  Joe said dumb ways to die. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2209.16s)]
*  I agree. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2211.16s)]
*  But what a rush. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2212.16s)]
*  Shark diving? [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2214.16s)]
*  I would do that. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2215.16s)]
*  I would do shark diving. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2216.16s)]
*  I never thought I would because water. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2217.16s)]
*  But, you know. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2220.16s)]
*  What do you mean because water? [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2224.16s)]
*  What about the water? [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2225.16s)]
*  I mean, I surf once, twice, three times maybe. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2226.16s)]
*  But I just, me and water don't mix. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2229.16s)]
*  I'm a buoyant. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2232.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2233.16s)]
*  I can say if you put me in the middle of the ocean right now, I probably have like 20 minutes or 30 minutes before I'm done. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2234.16s)]
*  Because I can try and tread water, but I'm so dense. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2240.16s)]
*  I'm skinny. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2243.16s)]
*  Don't float. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2244.16s)]
*  I'm so dense. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2245.16s)]
*  So yeah. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2246.16s)]
*  But shark diving, scuba tank, in a cage, reinforced. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2247.16s)]
*  I'll try it just for fun. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2250.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2252.16s)]
*  Like with a great white. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2253.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2254.16s)]
*  I've done it twice. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2255.16s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2256.16s)]
*  Once in Abu Dhabi. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2257.16s)]
*  The first one, fucking amazing. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2258.16s)]
*  Life-changing experience. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2260.16s)]
*  That was last year and the last year. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2261.16s)]
*  And then I did a random one this year just for fun. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2262.16s)]
*  And the second time wasn't as thrilling, but it was just cool to see. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2265.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2270.16s)]
*  Like everything. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2271.16s)]
*  You're not focused on surviving. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2272.16s)]
*  You're focused on enjoying it. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2273.16s)]
*  The first one I was just like, I wasn't even scared. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2274.16s)]
*  So shit like that. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2275.16s)]
*  Skydive. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2276.16s)]
*  Still have the McLaren. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2277.16s)]
*  I don't drive fast though, but I've taken to the track a couple of times. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2278.16s)]
*  So you just need to feel like you're going to die. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2281.16s)]
*  At the moment. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2283.16s)]
*  So again, who knows? [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2284.16s)]
*  When I have a kid, I might be like, I need to live. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2285.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2287.16s)]
*  That does happen. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2288.16s)]
*  You know? [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2289.16s)]
*  So again, that might. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2290.16s)]
*  That really does happen. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2291.16s)]
*  It's just freedom of thought. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2292.16s)]
*  I'm saying that now because that's how I feel. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2293.16s)]
*  I feel like I'll need something that's going to make me feel like I'm about to. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2294.16s)]
*  Because you know, I like that sauce. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2297.16s)]
*  He's like a white boy. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2298.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2299.16s)]
*  He's like a gentleman jumping for no reason. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2300.16s)]
*  He's a kiwi, bro. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2301.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2302.16s)]
*  He's a different breed. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2303.16s)]
*  If you grew up out there, trust me, you'd be different. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2304.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2309.16s)]
*  But that's a fighter thing. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2310.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2311.16s)]
*  Fighters cannot let go, man. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2313.16s)]
*  Because what could even come close to it? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2315.16s)]
*  What could come close to it? [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2317.16s)]
*  That's why I say when I'm done, I'm done. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2318.16s)]
*  And I know that feeling. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2320.16s)]
*  I talked to it even with Jason Miller about it as well because we had a little thing in [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2321.16s)]
*  LA. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2326.16s)]
*  But that feeling when you're backstage, you've done the last fucking warm up or whatever. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2327.16s)]
*  And then it's, you know, going on in five minutes, five minutes. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2331.16s)]
*  And then, you know, two minutes and then it counting down. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2336.16s)]
*  Okay, it's rope. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2340.16s)]
*  Time to go. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2341.16s)]
*  Cool. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2342.16s)]
*  You walk out, stand here, wait on your mark. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2343.16s)]
*  And then it's like, we're going on in 60 seconds. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2344.16s)]
*  And then we're in there and then everyone's behind you, your coaches. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2346.16s)]
*  And you turn around and you might give like a little fist bump, something. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2349.16s)]
*  And then you get out there, you get through the tunnel, you get the fucking wave, you [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2352.16s)]
*  see everything. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2356.16s)]
*  I wish I could actually describe this to people. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2357.16s)]
*  Maybe I'll do a VR experience with it one time and just say, oh, this is an idea for [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2359.16s)]
*  the UFC. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2363.16s)]
*  Do it. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2364.16s)]
*  Honestly, it's fucking crazy because you walk out, you see everything. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2365.16s)]
*  Everything. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2368.16s)]
*  You can see people yelling. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2369.16s)]
*  You can see all the people in the rafters. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2370.16s)]
*  Intense focus. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2371.16s)]
*  You can probably highlight little things because your mind is. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2372.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2375.16s)]
*  On my Ants and Silver fight, I saw one of my friends in the stand and I winked at him [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2376.16s)]
*  and he goes. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2379.16s)]
*  And again, that's just the thing. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2382.16s)]
*  You can just see everything. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2383.16s)]
*  You're so focused. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2384.16s)]
*  But yeah, that's nothing like it. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2385.16s)]
*  So what is life like when that's not happening? [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2387.16s)]
*  I have to let go. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2390.16s)]
*  And that's why I've seen a lot of guys like, what's that movie, the wrestler? [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2391.16s)]
*  No, no, I mean now like, like in between fights, like is, are you craving? [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2394.16s)]
*  Are you craving it? [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2398.16s)]
*  Are you thinking about like, or can you adjust to that kind of normal level? [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2399.16s)]
*  I've learned how to. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2404.16s)]
*  Because even, you know, shout out to Volkovsky. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2405.16s)]
*  He talked about it as well when, you know, he took the fight with Islam. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2407.16s)]
*  He said. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2410.16s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2411.16s)]
*  That's why they don't give me free time and a lot of money. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2412.16s)]
*  So for me. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2415.16s)]
*  So many fighters have said that they're like, you've got Tommy Morrison. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2418.16s)]
*  Remember that boxer? [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2421.16s)]
*  They're like, you've got to keep him in the gym. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2422.16s)]
*  Yeah, keep me busy. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2423.16s)]
*  And he ended up getting AIDS. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2424.16s)]
*  Which gym was he inside? [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2426.16s)]
*  I'm not a second person. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2433.16s)]
*  I am! [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2434.16s)]
*  But like, yeah, but it is true. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2435.16s)]
*  Like there must be, it just must be an experience. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2440.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2444.16s)]
*  Like nothing wrong, like being on stage and I felt certain things that are unbelievable, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2445.16s)]
*  remarkable. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2449.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2450.16s)]
*  don't even think it scratches the surface of what it's like to be in that arena knowing [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2451.16s)]
*  you could die. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2456.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2457.3799999999997s)]
*  It's a danger. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2458.3799999999997s)]
*  I was gonna say, you felt it. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2459.3799999999997s)]
*  All of you have felt it. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2460.3799999999997s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2461.3799999999997s)]
*  It's relative. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2462.3799999999997s)]
*  But the aspect of danger is just that thing that's the sauce. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2463.3799999999997s)]
*  And that makes it like, fuck, because you're like, I'm about to go against this guy. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2467.3399999999997s)]
*  And you're not thinking this, but you just know this is a possibility that I could get [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2471.7599999999998s)]
*  in this. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2475.1s)]
*  I could get sparked. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2477.3399999999997s)]
*  But also, I could do that to this guy. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2479.2400000000002s)]
*  And that's the gamble. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2481.82s)]
*  I'm a gambling man. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2482.82s)]
*  But I like to calculate my risks. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2483.82s)]
*  Calc the steak? [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2485.48s)]
*  Yeah, Calc the steak. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2486.48s)]
*  Honestly. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2487.48s)]
*  Steak boys in the building right now. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2488.48s)]
*  All of us. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2490.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's dope. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2491.48s)]
*  We out here. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2492.48s)]
*  We outside. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2493.48s)]
*  While we're here, and we're having, this is like a supercharged steak segment because [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2494.48s)]
*  we got Izzy in the motherfucking building. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2497.48s)]
*  And you know that John Jones and Aspen are about to go at it. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2500.6800000000003s)]
*  No, no. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2503.96s)]
*  I'm steeping. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2504.96s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2505.96s)]
*  Steeping. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2506.96s)]
*  We're in the fight we all want. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2508.1s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2509.1s)]
*  So yeah, what are we thinking about the Steepay fight? [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2510.1s)]
*  I think Steepay is a legend in the game. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2513.54s)]
*  One of if not the greatest heavyweight ever. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2517.06s)]
*  But John Jones is now a heavyweight, the heavyweight champion and one of if not the greatest fighter [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2519.9s)]
*  ever. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2525.66s)]
*  But I just want to see what Steepay looks like for maybe the coming weeks. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2526.66s)]
*  So the fights next month? [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2530.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2531.3s)]
*  Yeah, I want to see. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2532.3s)]
*  I think the, what do you call it, Serial Gans fight, I was like, oh, that's going to be [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2533.96s)]
*  hard. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2538.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2539.44s)]
*  Easy. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2540.44s)]
*  So I think he might even make this one easier. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2541.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2543.28s)]
*  I just feel like John is just a guy you can't doubt because that one I thought like, oh, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2544.28s)]
*  Serial Gans, new level heavyweight, similar size footwork, can grapple. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2548.8s)]
*  Nah. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2552.92s)]
*  I was like, yeah, John's that guy. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2553.92s)]
*  He's that guy. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2555.92s)]
*  Him and his bros were sitting next to us at the Sphere. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2556.92s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2559.32s)]
*  And I'm glad that you guys patched things up. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2560.32s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2561.32s)]
*  That was cool. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2562.34s)]
*  When that happened, that was cool bro. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2563.34s)]
*  Was it at the airport or something? [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2564.82s)]
*  No, no, at the bar. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2565.82s)]
*  And then his manager just goes, you know Izzy's behind you, right? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2566.82s)]
*  And he turns around and goes, yo, and I'm like, yo! [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2569.26s)]
*  And we just dapped up. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2571.82s)]
*  Oh, that's great. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2572.82s)]
*  And that was just like a moment like for me as a fan, because I've always been a fan. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2573.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2578.1400000000003s)]
*  And when we had B-Fold, it's like, well, fuck this guy. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2579.1400000000003s)]
*  But then we still always respected each other. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2581.1800000000003s)]
*  Sure. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2583.6600000000003s)]
*  So that was a cool moment for me. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2584.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2586.06s)]
*  Because you know, you my boy. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2587.06s)]
*  So I'm glad that you guys are cool. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2588.06s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2589.78s)]
*  He's cool as shit. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2590.78s)]
*  Nah, he's cool. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2592.2400000000002s)]
*  Nah, he's cool. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2593.2400000000002s)]
*  We hung out. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2594.2400000000002s)]
*  He's like, oh, like, yeah. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2595.2400000000002s)]
*  Like, there's like, obviously you guys need to be like professional, but like when there's [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2596.2400000000002s)]
*  no cameras on, like the jokes are flying, like both play football. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2599.92s)]
*  So they like, yeah. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2603.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh, I know, trust me. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2604.7200000000003s)]
*  We were at the bar for about 40 minutes and we talked about everything. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2605.7200000000003s)]
*  You're chopping it up. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2608.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2609.0s)]
*  I trust me. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2610.0s)]
*  So it's hard to bet against John in that one. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2611.0s)]
*  I don't, yeah, I don't see. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2613.52s)]
*  Also he's great. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2615.2000000000003s)]
*  He's, like I said, the greatest fighter we've ever seen. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2616.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2619.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2620.6800000000003s)]
*  He's gonna be. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2622.58s)]
*  What else? [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2623.58s)]
*  What else coming up is interesting? [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2624.58s)]
*  I'm trying to think, like. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2625.58s)]
*  I mean, do you think he fights Aspen Hall or do you think he does this and retires? [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2626.58s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2629.54s)]
*  He says he might. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2630.54s)]
*  He keeps saying he's gonna retire. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2631.54s)]
*  I would love to see him on Aspen Hall. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2632.54s)]
*  But look, that could be a fucking play. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2633.54s)]
*  It's just chess, not checkers. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2634.54s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2635.54s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2636.54s)]
*  That is true. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2637.54s)]
*  He says, I'm not fighting again. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2638.54s)]
*  And then when UFC goes, hey, we really want you to, their number might go up. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2639.54s)]
*  So he could be working game for sure. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2642.62s)]
*  Who wins Aspen Hall, John Jones is the best. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2644.3399999999997s)]
*  If that does happen. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2646.4199999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2647.4199999999996s)]
*  Ooh, that's, they gotta fight. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2648.4199999999996s)]
*  Because Aspen Hall's good. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2649.4199999999996s)]
*  I think, fuck. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2651.16s)]
*  It's hard to go against John, bro. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2652.16s)]
*  I mean, respect Aspen Hall. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2653.16s)]
*  He finds a way, he finds a way. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2654.16s)]
*  But Aspen Hall, so far, the way he dispatched off Sergant. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2658.16s)]
*  The Russian guy. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2662.12s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2663.12s)]
*  And he's fast. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2664.12s)]
*  I met him. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2665.12s)]
*  That's the thing, he's fast. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2666.12s)]
*  Sat next to him at 300. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2667.12s)]
*  He and his dad, cool dudes. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2668.12s)]
*  Lovely guys as well. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2670.12s)]
*  But he's the same height as me, if not an inch taller, but thick. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2671.12s)]
*  And I was like, fuck, you're a lot thicker than I would expect. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2675.12s)]
*  And the speed, that's the thing that I'm like, okay, that's the danger. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2678.66s)]
*  But again, grappling, he's a black belt. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2682.34s)]
*  But John is fucking. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2684.9s)]
*  It's different. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2686.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2687.38s)]
*  But I don't know, man. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2688.38s)]
*  They gotta fight. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2689.38s)]
*  But if they don't ever fight, we'll never know. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2690.38s)]
*  Because we had that with John and Silva. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2691.7s)]
*  We had that with Silva and GSP. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2693.38s)]
*  So all these fights, we will never see. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2694.86s)]
*  So we just have to have them in the ether forever and ever. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2697.66s)]
*  And we'll talk about it here. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2701.2599999999998s)]
*  But if you do, you're gonna. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2702.2599999999998s)]
*  You bet on these fights. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2704.2599999999998s)]
*  You're gonna bet with Stake. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2705.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2706.2599999999998s)]
*  Shout out Stake, bro. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2707.48s)]
*  They'll be taking care of you. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2708.48s)]
*  Fuck you. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2709.48s)]
*  Shout out Stake. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2710.48s)]
*  Go, go to Stake. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2711.48s)]
*  Go get your money up. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2712.48s)]
*  Do we have a sign up code or anything like that, Tramell? [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2713.48s)]
*  Flagrant. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2714.48s)]
*  Flagrant. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2715.48s)]
*  Flagrant sign up code to get your sign up bonus. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2716.48s)]
*  Go check out Stake. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2717.48s)]
*  I'm sure Izzy got one as well. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2718.6400000000003s)]
*  You could probably use either, but use ours. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2720.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2721.8s)]
*  Flagrant. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2722.8s)]
*  Use ours. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2723.8s)]
*  I'm like, I'm Jewish. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2724.8s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2725.8s)]
*  This is Dove's deal. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2726.8s)]
*  Let's get back to the show, man. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2727.8s)]
*  But you actually worried me something you said before. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2732.8s)]
*  Because you said like some of the pressure is a bit lifted off of you because you're [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2735.34s)]
*  not defending the belt. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2738.7s)]
*  So you're maybe, you're looking forward to trying more things in the ring and having [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2739.78s)]
*  fun. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2743.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2744.82s)]
*  But doesn't that come with heavy risks? [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2745.82s)]
*  Like trying. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2747.62s)]
*  Well, calculator risks. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2748.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2749.62s)]
*  So I try to find a bout. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2750.62s)]
*  You just do it. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2751.62s)]
*  So again, like when I fought, what's his name? [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2752.62s)]
*  Like Tavares, when I did that in the fight, or even the first victory fight, there was [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2755.62s)]
*  this move, spin move with the kick I did. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2758.94s)]
*  I'd never tried it in the gym, but I was like, oh, I saw a Mally do this. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2760.98s)]
*  And it landed and it's now always on my highlights. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2765.08s)]
*  So those kind of things. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2767.92s)]
*  I just had the confidence to do them back then because I just do it. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2768.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2772.2s)]
*  And if I'm confident in myself, like my tornado kick and kickboxing, I'd never tried it on [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2773.2s)]
*  my training mates because it's really dangerous. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2776.92s)]
*  But then I knocked down a heavyweight with it in the ring live. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2779.92s)]
*  First time ever trying it. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2783.0s)]
*  I've tried it on pads, tried it on the bag, but I never tried it on a real person inspiring. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2784.0s)]
*  And I had him against the ropes. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2787.88s)]
*  Boom, hit him. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2788.88s)]
*  So shit like that, I want to try and just have fun because I'm not really, again, my [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2791.1400000000003s)]
*  legacy is, I said this already, if what I've already done in this game, a lot of people [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2795.1400000000003s)]
*  don't even get to the belt, a lot of people don't even get to the UFC, but I've done it [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2802.02s)]
*  twice, still the only two time middleweight champion. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2804.86s)]
*  And if what I've already done in this game will make me happy, then what will? [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2807.7400000000002s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2811.34s)]
*  What's going to make me happy? [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2812.34s)]
*  It's like, no, I'm happy, but I'm not content. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2813.34s)]
*  I still have a few things I want to try, a few moves I want to do, a few sequences that [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2815.58s)]
*  I just feel, and some that I don't even know about, that I just going to, when I see them [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2821.3199999999997s)]
*  on the highlights, I'll be like, ooh, that was tight. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2824.56s)]
*  So they're yet to come. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2826.84s)]
*  So I look forward to creating those. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2827.96s)]
*  That's the artist in me because I just like, again, submission, I know I'm a choker motherfucker [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2830.92s)]
*  out. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2835.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm definitely going to get one of those. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2836.2799999999997s)]
*  The tricky thing is like, whenever you fight, there's going to be demand and attention. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2838.92s)]
*  There are certain people that their career ends not because they want to end. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2845.56s)]
*  You got to break up with fighting before fighting breakups with you. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2851.46s)]
*  And sometimes it breaks up with them. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2853.94s)]
*  And that's got to be, think about how brutal that is because you're like, I still need [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2855.94s)]
*  this. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2859.66s)]
*  I've seen it. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2860.66s)]
*  I've seen it. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2861.66s)]
*  I've seen it even in my own gym with some people. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2862.66s)]
*  And I'm just like, bro, he should stop because he's older and this. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2864.2999999999997s)]
*  And then you see the fights, he's just like, but you can't say anything. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2868.2999999999997s)]
*  It's not my place. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2873.14s)]
*  What is the conversation like with them? [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2874.14s)]
*  I'm going to talk to the coaches so they have to have that conversation. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2875.72s)]
*  And will they do it? [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2877.3599999999997s)]
*  Will the coaches? [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2878.3599999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah, definitely. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2879.3599999999997s)]
*  And how does that go? [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2880.3599999999997s)]
*  Will Eugene sit somebody down and say, I haven't seen it. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2881.7599999999998s)]
*  It hasn't happened to me. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2884.16s)]
*  I haven't had that talk yet. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2885.16s)]
*  Yeah, of course not. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2886.16s)]
*  But I think probably most coaches who care about you will let you know, bro, I think [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2887.16s)]
*  it's time. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2891.8399999999997s)]
*  And they'll see it and let you know. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2892.8399999999997s)]
*  And if you don't want to listen, you're still stubborn, then they'll support you because [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2895.0s)]
*  you're going to do it anyway. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2898.2s)]
*  If you're going to do it anyway, then they're like, okay, cool. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2899.2s)]
*  But aren't the coaches incentivized to having the fighters fight as long as possible? [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2901.68s)]
*  So then they continue getting. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2905.2599999999998s)]
*  That's the coaches if they don't care about their fighters. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2906.2599999999998s)]
*  Like these gyms who have fighters that just like cattle. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2909.02s)]
*  It's just a mill. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2911.94s)]
*  It's a factory. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2912.94s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2913.94s)]
*  Or managers who have fucking 300 fighters on their roster. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2914.94s)]
*  It's just, you know, they can't care about all of them. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2916.74s)]
*  Some of them it's just they're getting 10%, 20% here. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2919.42s)]
*  It all adds up and they end up being rich. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2921.62s)]
*  So it's about caring about someone and caring about their well-being. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2923.5s)]
*  So yeah, you don't want to put someone in there. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2928.02s)]
*  You just on the world stage and that's it. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2929.22s)]
*  Because then the stock of your gym, the stock of your fighters goes down. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2931.68s)]
*  Yeah, you want to keep it up. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2936.8799999999997s)]
*  So I know you just not that kind of guy like he'll mean him even before that. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2938.3599999999997s)]
*  I think I'll know before him and probably even at the same time. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2942.7999999999997s)]
*  We'll know. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2946.48s)]
*  We'll just know. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2947.48s)]
*  And then it'd be like, yeah, I'll know when it's time. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2948.48s)]
*  When do you want to break up with fighting? [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2950.7599999999998s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2952.92s)]
*  I'll break up with fighting. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2953.92s)]
*  You know, when it would even like it's not even it's not. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2954.92s)]
*  You can't say we're fighting. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2961.02s)]
*  It's not you. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2962.02s)]
*  It's me. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2963.02s)]
*  It is me because fighting is always going to be there. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2964.02s)]
*  But it's me. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2965.7s)]
*  Like it's father time. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2966.7s)]
*  We'll catch up with all of us at some point. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2968.5s)]
*  Like I said, now I have to have breakfast because I realized, okay, that actually helps [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2970.18s)]
*  you fuel you before your first training rather than just rolling out of bed and then cool, [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2973.34s)]
*  let's get to the gym. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2977.14s)]
*  Do the damn thing. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2978.14s)]
*  But yeah, when will I? [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2980.06s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2982.98s)]
*  But I know I said at 20 something, I say when I'm 34, I'm done with this game. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2983.98s)]
*  I'm 35 now. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2988.3s)]
*  But I know I still I said I'm over the halfway point. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2989.3s)]
*  Then I'm definitely a few years away, maybe three years away. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2994.2000000000003s)]
*  But who knows? [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2997.7200000000003s)]
*  I know I'm I don't want to be fighting at 40. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=2998.7200000000003s)]
*  Would you do an exhibition? [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3000.52s)]
*  Go to Japan? [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3001.52s)]
*  Have some fun, make some money. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3002.52s)]
*  Maybe some wrestling maybe. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3004.1200000000003s)]
*  But like after UFC, that's the what the fuck else? [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3005.4s)]
*  Like bro, all this shit like go box or go do this. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3008.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm like nah, I've been on the top. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3011.6000000000004s)]
*  The baddest of the baddest with the baddest of the baddest. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3014.32s)]
*  Like what else compares? [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3016.52s)]
*  The UFC, they get a lot of flack, but still, it's the highest combat sports league in the [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3018.7400000000002s)]
*  game right now. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3026.1s)]
*  So what else compares to that for me? [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3027.38s)]
*  And that was my dream to be in the UFC and then be a champion. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3029.1400000000003s)]
*  And then so I'm going to go box some YouTuber for, I mean, fuck 20 million. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3032.6600000000003s)]
*  But I'm saying, look, I'll pray on it. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3038.7000000000003s)]
*  Insha'Allah, I'll pray on it. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3043.98s)]
*  But we'll see. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3047.16s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3048.16s)]
*  But like, I just don't think anything because of my code and my morals as well. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3049.16s)]
*  And like, again, I'm not desperate for it. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3054.4s)]
*  So yeah, I'm not desperate for that kind of money because again, shots of my pops, he's [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3056.8s)]
*  looked after the family, the family seats. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3061.56s)]
*  So yeah, I think there's other ways to make money. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3064.0s)]
*  Voice over acting, fucking video game. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3066.12s)]
*  The video game world is crazy. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3067.84s)]
*  So much more money than Hollywood. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3070.3s)]
*  Because people are actually playing video games. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3072.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, people are watching movies that they used to. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3074.54s)]
*  Like so many new games. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3077.8599999999997s)]
*  I got to go home and there's Wukong I'm playing and then fucking Warhammer. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3078.8599999999997s)]
*  I'm playing as well right now. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3082.1s)]
*  I don't know if you guys are on game. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3083.1s)]
*  No, not nerds. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3085.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3086.1s)]
*  Well, yeah, for me, those games are not keeping me busy and I can see myself doing motion [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3087.1s)]
*  capture for those kinds of shit. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3090.7799999999997s)]
*  That'd be sick. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3091.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3092.7799999999997s)]
*  I'm great at motion capture. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3093.7799999999997s)]
*  I've never done motion capture, but I know for a fact, I'd be really good at creating [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3094.7799999999997s)]
*  certain things with motion capture and the possibilities are endless because I could [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3099.96s)]
*  be whatever. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3103.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3104.4s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3105.4s)]
*  So yeah, that I'd love to get into. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3106.4s)]
*  I think that a lot of people like outside of fighting can't fathom that anybody does [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3108.0400000000004s)]
*  it for another reason besides money. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3115.6400000000003s)]
*  And like the more that you talk about it, the less I feel you've ever done it for money. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3119.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I've done it for free for years. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3124.4s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3126.36s)]
*  So the idea, like the desire to keep fighting is to scratch the itch that is still there. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3127.82s)]
*  Whereas everybody else goes, yeah, he's so fucking rich and he's got everything and he's [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3133.98s)]
*  got his health. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3138.34s)]
*  He's got like, why would you even want to do it? [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3139.34s)]
*  And then you're like, well, the same reason I did it for free. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3141.38s)]
*  Because it is the thing in life that excites me the most and motivates me the most. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3144.1800000000003s)]
*  It's the reason I get up in the fucking morning. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3148.1s)]
*  It's like, I imagine when you have a fight sign like the three months before, it's like [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3150.02s)]
*  every single day has purpose. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3153.46s)]
*  Every single day is meaningful. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3156.16s)]
*  And yeah, I think that's the perspective you got to look at it. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3158.2599999999998s)]
*  This camp was my best camp in the sense that I did everything because again, for the time [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3162.3799999999997s)]
*  you realize the way your body operates. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3168.7s)]
*  So I did the massages every week, what you call it, ice baths every day, the breakfast, [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3171.18s)]
*  the nutrition was on, the strength and conditioning. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3178.74s)]
*  And there was not one day this camp, because again, other camps, some days I wake up, I'm [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3181.8599999999997s)]
*  like, fuck my body and just like, ugh. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3185.7599999999998s)]
*  But this last camp, there's not one day where I woke up and I was just like, ugh, this is [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3188.16s)]
*  fucking a drag. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3192.7599999999998s)]
*  And it's because I did all the things, all the little things. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3193.7599999999998s)]
*  I see me at night with the fucking Hyper Ice boots on, you know, the ones that, I think [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3197.12s)]
*  ballers use it as well. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3202.24s)]
*  So I was on that. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3203.8399999999997s)]
*  And- [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3205.72s)]
*  Dawg, Dawg uses it too. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3206.72s)]
*  Yeah, he's a baller. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3207.72s)]
*  But yeah, so for me, I'm always trying to find ways to, well, how can I make this better? [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3208.72s)]
*  How can I make the next camp better? [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3215.5s)]
*  How can I make myself better? [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3216.86s)]
*  And again, what we've done, the testing now, I know where we're at. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3218.22s)]
*  I look forward to the next one. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3221.78s)]
*  And whenever that is, meh. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3223.78s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3225.78s)]
*  But best believe you'll see the best version of me again. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3227.46s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a break for a second, because I got to tell you guys about [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3230.18s)]
*  Odoo. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3232.7s)]
*  It has happened. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3233.7s)]
*  Finally, a company has come around that makes you not only starting your business, running [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3234.7s)]
*  a business that you have built up over years. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3241.7599999999998s)]
*  Finally, there is a company that has made running it easier for you. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3245.64s)]
*  I'm talking about literally everything that it takes to run your business now can be consolidated [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3250.0s)]
*  under one roof by Odoo. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3256.3199999999997s)]
*  Odoo is an all-in-one platform that combines practically every single tool that you could [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3258.3199999999997s)]
*  pay for as a business owner under one roof. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3262.8399999999997s)]
*  You can save hundreds, maybe thousands of dollars by making the switch to Odoo. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3265.9399999999996s)]
*  Doing the same things you're already doing, but now it's just in one place. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3270.52s)]
*  They have a time tracking platform so employees can track their hours work. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3273.42s)]
*  They have an accounting platform to replace QuickBooks, invoicing, and much more. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3276.9s)]
*  Plans start for as low as $24.90 a month. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3281.82s)]
*  That is $24.90 a month, and you can have everything that you do in your business now consolidated. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3284.52s)]
*  I mean, think about it. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3290.22s)]
*  DocuSign alone. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3292.42s)]
*  DocuSign, that app that you're using to sign documents so you can do it on your phone, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3293.74s)]
*  that's $25 a month alone. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3297.98s)]
*  And you can use Odoo's signature platform, does the exact same thing for the same price [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3299.7999999999997s)]

*  And here's the thing. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3314.56s)]
*  Your first app on Odoo is free for life with unlimited hosting and support. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3315.66s)]

*  Let's get back to the show. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3340.7s)]
*  All right, guys, we have to take a break for a second to share with you the power of positive [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3341.7s)]
*  thinking. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3346.54s)]
*  Okay. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3347.54s)]
*  On a podcast a few episodes ago while, you know, Bitcoin started to soar and crypto looked [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3348.54s)]
*  like it was out of the gutter, we said, you know what, we want some money. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3354.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3357.54s)]
*  We want to get some money. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3358.54s)]
*  We shouted out in exchange, an OG exchange. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3360.52s)]
*  Exchange has been around what, 13 years? [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3364.04s)]
*  That's important. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3366.2799999999997s)]
*  No FTX drama over here. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3367.2799999999997s)]

*  Hopefully. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3370.2799999999997s)]

*  Hopefully it's not bank fraud. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3456.54s)]
*  Hopefully it's not bank fraud. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3457.54s)]
*  I think it seems pretty legit. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3458.54s)]
*  I think it is. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3459.54s)]

*  We're going to jail. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3470.54s)]
*  We're going to jail. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3471.54s)]
*  We're going to jail. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3472.54s)]
*  We're going to jail. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3473.54s)]
*  We're going to jail. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3474.54s)]
*  Anyway, not only is Kraken where it's at. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3476.52s)]
*  That's what you told me in Sweden too. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3478.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3480.52s)]
*  You shouldn't have violated the law. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3481.52s)]
*  You shouldn't have violated the law. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3482.52s)]
*  The point that I'm trying to make is Kraken put 10 grand into each one of our accounts [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3483.52s)]
*  and we got to buy our own crypto with it, which we are not endorsing in any way, shape [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3488.52s)]
*  or form. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3495.52s)]
*  This is not an endorsement. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3496.52s)]
*  Matter of fact, if I was you, I wouldn't buy anything I bought. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3497.52s)]

*  I'm already down to be honest with you. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3505.5s)]
*  It got deposited in my account. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3507.5s)]
*  I looked at it and it was less than what he said. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3508.5s)]
*  You hear that, Coffeezilla? [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3510.5s)]
*  Do you hear what we're saying right now? [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3511.5s)]
*  We're being defrauded. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3514.5s)]
*  We are. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3515.5s)]
*  Your boy is up. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3516.5s)]

*  Your boy is up. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3518.5s)]
*  He might be inside of training, Coffee. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3519.5s)]
*  Go look at him. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3520.5s)]

*  Look at him up. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3523.5s)]
*  My point is. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3524.5s)]
*  My name is Akash Singh. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3525.5s)]
*  My point is we have all been given that 10 grand. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3526.5s)]
*  Listen, and after how long are we going to do until we? [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3532.48s)]
*  End of December. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3535.48s)]
*  After end of December. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3536.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3537.48s)]
*  The winner. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3538.48s)]
*  Your boy is up. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3539.48s)]
*  I'm just saying. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3540.48s)]
*  Gets a full investigative piece by Coffeezilla. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3541.48s)]
*  The winner. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3542.48s)]
*  So we are actively trying to lose money over here. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3543.48s)]
*  Listen, if Kraken want to give us their money to lose, we're going to lose it. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3546.48s)]
*  Let it be. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3551.48s)]
*  Okay? [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3552.48s)]
*  But the winner gets investigated by Coffeezilla full. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3553.48s)]
*  And again, Coffee, if you sense any foul play, we're too stupid to know if we play foul. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3555.48s)]
*  All you got to do is hit us up. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3561.46s)]
*  Word. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3562.46s)]
*  All you got to do is hit us up. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3563.46s)]
*  You don't even need to hit us up. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3564.46s)]
*  Just put a video of out. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3565.46s)]
*  If you put one suspender over your shoulder, we'll delete the whole podcast. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3566.46s)]
*  Okay? [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3571.46s)]
*  We're deleting the whole podcast. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3572.46s)]
*  If one suspender goes over his shoulder, that strikes enough fear in our souls that we delete [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3574.46s)]
*  the whole podcast. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3578.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3580.46s)]
*  But Kraken. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3581.46s)]
*  Kraken is where we're going to be doing our crypto. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3582.46s)]
*  Okay? [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3585.46s)]
*  So let's hope Bitcoin keeps rising. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3586.46s)]
*  Let's hope that every annoying crypto dude out there thinks they're a genius now that [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3588.44s)]
*  crypto's up. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3592.44s)]
*  I liked it when they had a little humility in their system. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3593.44s)]
*  Oh wait, you ain't know I'm a genius now. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3596.44s)]
*  The arrogance. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3598.44s)]
*  You ain't know? [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3599.44s)]
*  The arrogance. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3600.44s)]
*  The arrogance. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3601.44s)]
*  The arrogance that comes with crypto. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3602.44s)]
*  When Trump got elected, I became a genius. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3603.44s)]
*  Is this a mock picks, bro? [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3606.44s)]
*  Go get them suspenders. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3608.44s)]

*  You came upstairs. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3877.64s)]

*  I'm like, I'm good. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3890.64s)]
*  And he's still, he's probably like 18 punches deep. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3891.64s)]
*  Wasn't really hitting me, but it was like hitting the guard. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3894.64s)]
*  I'm just like, cool. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3897.64s)]
*  And I start fighting back. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3898.64s)]
*  But the whole fight just felt like a weird dream. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3899.64s)]
*  You know the dreams? [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3902.64s)]
*  Like when you're trying to like really, and in a dream trying to hit the monster, you're [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3904.3399999999997s)]
*  like, what the fuck? [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3907.3399999999997s)]

*  He has pressure, his game. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3911.8599999999997s)]
*  He does apply good pressure and like consistent pressure while closing distance. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3913.3399999999997s)]
*  Wait till I fight him again. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3919.3399999999997s)]
*  Like with DDP, I walked him back a few times. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3920.3399999999997s)]
*  100%. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3924.3399999999997s)]
*  I feel like he was just, like he was affected when he was doing that bum rush thing. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3925.3399999999997s)]
*  It's such a weird, what are you thinking as a fighter? [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3929.3399999999997s)]
*  Literally your entire life that your coaches are going, whatever you do, don't run straight [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3932.34s)]
*  and just throw big, big punches. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3937.04s)]
*  But you're bent down, not even looking. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3938.04s)]
*  But why is it effective you think? [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3941.04s)]
*  I think just him as a fighter, the style, the cadence, even his question mark kick, [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3942.54s)]
*  it's so slow. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3946.54s)]
*  It's peculiar though, right? [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3947.54s)]
*  By the time you block it and come back, now he didn't hit me with it, he had Strickland [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3948.54s)]
*  with it, but I've seen him when he did it, he'd question mark and catch him. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3951.54s)]
*  But it's so slow. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3955.04s)]
*  By the time you block and come down, then it hits you. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3956.04s)]
*  It's weird. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3958.04s)]
*  It's weird. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3959.04s)]
*  It's like off speed. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3960.04s)]
*  Off speed. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3961.04s)]
*  He's off speed. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3962.74s)]
*  I remember when Manny Pacquiao fought Manuel Marquez or whatever. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3963.74s)]
*  Juan Manuel Marquez. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3966.74s)]
*  His trainer after the third fight or something was like, now that Manny is a more orthodox [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3967.74s)]
*  fighter and more traditional, I think we're going to have an easier time with him. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3973.14s)]
*  Because before we never knew what was coming, where it was coming from. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3975.94s)]
*  It was so unorthodox, you couldn't figure it out. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3978.94s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3980.94s)]
*  The freedom, the freedom to try whatever. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3981.94s)]
*  But I don't think that's him. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3983.94s)]
*  I think he's just awkward. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3985.44s)]
*  That's his style. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3986.44s)]
*  And also his will. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3987.44s)]
*  And durability. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3988.44s)]
*  His will. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3989.44s)]
*  His will power. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3990.44s)]
*  When he's tired, he'll still go. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3991.84s)]
*  Because there was a bit in the fourth round, I was lighting him up and he shot and I sprawled [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3992.84s)]
*  back of his head. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3997.84s)]
*  My nuts hit him. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3998.84s)]
*  Boom. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=3999.84s)]
*  Into the ground. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4000.84s)]
*  And I thought I rocked him maybe. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4001.84s)]
*  But then I get up and I'm there. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4002.84s)]
*  And then, what's his name? [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4004.54s)]
*  Ref's like, get up. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4005.54s)]
*  He didn't get up. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4006.54s)]
*  He gets on his knees and the ref's like, get up. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4007.54s)]
*  And he finally gets up and I attack him. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4009.54s)]
*  He didn't even care about what he, he just wanted to throw. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4011.54s)]
*  So he threw. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4013.54s)]
*  And you have to address it because it's something coming at you. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4014.54s)]
*  But he just throws just to stop you in your tracks. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4018.54s)]
*  So he's not trying to hit you. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4021.54s)]
*  He's not doing an aiming fire. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4022.54s)]
*  He's throwing and hoping. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4023.54s)]
*  So it just stops you in your tracks. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4024.54s)]
*  It stops your momentum. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4026.54s)]
*  And then you have to go again. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4027.54s)]
*  But his will. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4028.54s)]
*  He's a stubborn dude. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4029.54s)]
*  A stubborn dude. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4030.54s)]
*  But you just have to out will him. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4031.54s)]
*  And again, I can't wait for that fight. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4033.54s)]
*  You know, guys like Strickland or whoever. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4034.54s)]
*  Because now, Pereira, the second fight, I remember thinking, I told Eugene, I'm going [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4036.54s)]
*  to stress you out this fight. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4040.54s)]
*  You know that, right? [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4041.54s)]
*  And he's like, what? [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4042.54s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going to strick. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4043.54s)]
*  Because I know in the corner he's going to be like, oh, fuck, that was close. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4044.54s)]
*  And in Miami, that was. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4047.54s)]
*  That was. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4048.64s)]
*  Because I'm going to be right there. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4049.64s)]
*  And I was pushing him back. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4050.64s)]
*  When he pushes me back, I'm like, nah, it's a. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4051.64s)]
*  I know how to do it to people. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4054.64s)]
*  So when you go, when you went for Pereira, too. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4055.64s)]
*  I was like, yeah, let's go. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4060.64s)]
*  Like I told you, I'm going to stress you out. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4062.64s)]
*  Because you have a lot of confidence going into one, I feel like. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4063.64s)]
*  And I feel like you were. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4066.64s)]
*  I was beating him. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4067.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4068.64s)]
*  I mean, round one is 10 seconds longer. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4069.64s)]
*  It's a first round. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4071.64s)]
*  Five, three seconds longer. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4072.64s)]
*  That's what I needed. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4073.64s)]
*  That's a break in. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4074.64s)]
*  That's the life of it. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4075.64s)]
*  And then it got to the point where eventually I lose to him. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4076.74s)]
*  I say, all right, let's do it again. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4080.74s)]
*  Then I straight away. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4081.74s)]
*  Boom. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4082.74s)]
*  And then in the part two fight, I'm just like, I'm coming at you. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4083.74s)]
*  And even when I walk or watch the walkout now. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4086.74s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4088.74s)]
*  Stop, stop, stop. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4089.74s)]
*  You decide to come at him. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4090.74s)]
*  Is that strategy? [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4091.74s)]
*  Because you think he thinks that you're going to be. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4092.74s)]
*  Got it. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4095.74s)]
*  OK, so they think, oh, he's just going to move back and leg kicks and paw, paw, paw. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4096.74s)]
*  I'm like, nah, watch this. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4099.74s)]
*  I told you, I'm going to stress you the fuck out. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4100.74s)]
*  This is like two weeks before the fight or three weeks before the fight. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4102.74s)]
*  Two weeks before I hurt my knee. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4104.74s)]
*  And then, yeah, so even going into that fight, fucked up me. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4105.84s)]
*  I was just like, I'm going to attack him and go forward. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4108.84s)]
*  So first round, he so first on the first thing that he realizes, oh shit, he's not afraid. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4110.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4115.84s)]
*  So now his, his mental in that fight is going to be completely. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4116.84s)]
*  They expected me to move back and just kind of. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4119.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4122.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4123.84s)]
*  So for me, I'm just like, no, I'm going to attack him because sometimes people forget [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4124.84s)]
*  I can do that. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4127.84s)]
*  And so you show them in like, oh shit, he can. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4128.84s)]
*  So you put pressure on. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4130.84s)]
*  I can. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4132.84s)]
*  I can. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4133.9400000000005s)]
*  And then eventually he got me. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4134.9400000000005s)]
*  Pereira, like certain people just used to taking leg kicks. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4136.9400000000005s)]
*  How does that affect? [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4139.9400000000005s)]
*  That's when I'm able to push Pereira backwards is I'll go south paw because I can just check [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4140.9400000000005s)]
*  the leg kick from this stance. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4144.9400000000005s)]
*  I can just turn the knee in and then I was pushing him backwards south paw. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4146.9400000000005s)]
*  So I'm like, okay. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4149.9400000000005s)]
*  Wait, is he traditional? [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4150.9400000000005s)]
*  He's orthodox. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4151.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4152.9400000000005s)]
*  So he's he likes orthodox. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4153.9400000000005s)]
*  He can fight both ways, but not as good as he prefers. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4154.9400000000005s)]
*  And then when he throws that quick little kick, it's orthodox. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4156.9400000000005s)]
*  So if you're orthodox, orthodox, that's when so whenever for me. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4159.9400000000005s)]
*  So you have to throw it to the inside of your calf. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4163.04s)]
*  That's easier to check. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4165.04s)]
*  And then you just leaning into it. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4166.04s)]
*  Just turn the knee. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4168.04s)]
*  So for me, when he hurt my leg and then I went south paw and then this is by the cage. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4169.04s)]
*  I was like, you know what? [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4173.04s)]
*  I'm going to bring him in. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4174.04s)]
*  I just went and give him. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4175.04s)]
*  So I went, you see me, I switched back to orthodox. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4176.04s)]
*  I was like, he's going to take the leg. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4178.04s)]
*  Seeing the tear that Alex is on right now, does that make the victory feel? [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4179.04s)]
*  I hope he never stops. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4184.04s)]
*  Yeah, because it just makes your victory feel so sweeter, right? [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4185.04s)]
*  David, what did you say the other day? [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4188.04s)]
*  David, what did you say the other day? [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4189.14s)]
*  No one's ever gone past two rounds, a round and a half with him. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4190.14s)]
*  And I never thought about that till he said it. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4194.14s)]
*  And I was like, oh yeah, only Yon, I think, was the only one maybe. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4195.14s)]
*  As a wrestler. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4199.14s)]
*  Yeah, standing on the feet. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4200.14s)]
*  Again, to stand on the feet with him. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4203.14s)]
*  And even he said, you told me last night. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4205.14s)]
*  I saw it on Instagram. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4208.14s)]
*  Hopefully this is a real quote. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4209.14s)]
*  But he was talking about, they're asking about another guy that like, I guess was in [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4210.14s)]
*  kickboxing with you guys. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4214.14s)]
*  I don't know if you had fought him. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4215.14s)]
*  I haven't seen it yet. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4216.14s)]
*  I think Alex had fought him. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4217.14s)]
*  And they basically asked him, do you think he'll be successful at UFC? [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4218.240000000001s)]
*  And he's like, he's not Izzy, he's not me. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4221.240000000001s)]
*  Like he can't do it. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4223.240000000001s)]
*  And again, I don't know your guys' relationship. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4224.240000000001s)]
*  And even if that's a real quote, because it's on fucking Instagram. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4226.240000000001s)]
*  But if it is, I think it's a pretty cool admission of respect. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4229.240000000001s)]
*  Oh, no, we know. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4234.240000000001s)]
*  Like me and him know every time to fight each other is not an easy fight. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4235.240000000001s)]
*  And now we've had that rivalry. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4238.240000000001s)]
*  And again, I've said this some people are like, oh, you scared, you scared. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4241.240000000001s)]
*  I'm like, then why did I fight him straight away after he knocked me out in the biggest [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4244.240000000001s)]
*  fucking arena in the world? [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4247.34s)]
*  But it's not that. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4248.34s)]
*  It's just for me, the story itself, the whole story. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4249.34s)]
*  Like even what did Dana say? [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4252.34s)]
*  You could do a 30 for 30 on us. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4253.34s)]
*  That means crazy. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4254.34s)]
*  Going back. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4255.34s)]
*  And you should. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4256.34s)]
*  You will. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4257.34s)]
*  Honestly, like a 30 for 30 ESPN special on our fucking story from kickboxing and then [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4258.34s)]
*  him chasing me and then this. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4265.34s)]
*  And we should even do an interview afterwards. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4267.34s)]
*  Just fucking. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4269.34s)]
*  Just the two of you. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4270.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4271.34s)]
*  Sit down and I mean, just Shama. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4272.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4273.34s)]
*  You know, and then I'll say whatever I say and then Shama. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4274.34s)]
*  And then bro it out. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4276.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4278.4400000000005s)]
*  It seems like he has a lot of love for you, which I like. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4279.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4281.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4282.4400000000005s)]
*  It's. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4283.4400000000005s)]
*  Or respect. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4284.4400000000005s)]
*  Respect. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4285.4400000000005s)]
*  There's something about it. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4286.4400000000005s)]
*  Like if you knock someone out, even me, like I let it go and he knocked me out. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4287.4400000000005s)]
*  I never chased him. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4290.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4291.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm always fine. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4292.4400000000005s)]
*  Like, look, if the Sean fight never happens again, I'm fine. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4293.4400000000005s)]
*  If you've never been in that situation, you never understand how to let go. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4294.4400000000005s)]
*  You have to be willing to let go. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4297.4400000000005s)]
*  You can't keep chasing these things. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4299.4400000000005s)]
*  So for me, I don't chase them. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4300.4400000000005s)]
*  They always come back around. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4302.4400000000005s)]
*  And that's how I know these moments come back around. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4304.54s)]
*  But yeah, we've had that. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4306.54s)]
*  If I fight him again and I knock him out, then oh look, it's three, two now. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4308.54s)]
*  Best out of seven. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4311.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4312.54s)]
*  Who am I fighting for? [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4313.54s)]
*  And then I only have how much more left in the game. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4314.54s)]
*  I'm not going to try and, you know, just to entertain people. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4316.54s)]
*  There's more fights I'd rather do. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4320.54s)]
*  Couple more rematches I'd rather do. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4321.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4323.54s)]
*  So yeah, I don't want to keep chasing the same fucking or beating a dead horse or whatever. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4324.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4329.54s)]
*  Now you said that you believe he actually does use spells. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4330.54s)]
*  Look, we all have something. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4333.64s)]
*  We all have something. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4335.64s)]
*  Now we're talking. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4337.64s)]
*  A little. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4338.64s)]
*  Now we're talking. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4339.64s)]
*  Like I said, before I fought him in Miami, there was nights I'd just be just in the house shadow boxing, pacing up and down, microdosed up a little bit or macrodosed. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4340.64s)]
*  Or I'd be in the shower. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4347.64s)]
*  I've said that shower is the greatest place to create. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4348.64s)]
*  Yeah, shower shrooms. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4350.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4351.64s)]
*  That's what you're saying. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4352.64s)]
*  Yeah, shower shrooms. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4354.64s)]
*  And just like there was one night, Chance is in bed sleeping and I just go in his room, like towel on, like Chance, Chance. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4355.740000000001s)]
*  He's like, huh? [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4364.740000000001s)]
*  Oh shit. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4365.740000000001s)]
*  I'm like, I'm on. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4366.740000000001s)]
*  He's like, oh, okay. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4367.740000000001s)]
*  He knew straight away what I meant. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4369.740000000001s)]
*  Because sometimes if he comes home and he hears the same track on the loop and I'm in the shower, he just knows, ah, he's in his own. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4371.740000000001s)]
*  He's in there in that void he's creating. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4379.740000000001s)]
*  So again, I don't know if anyone else does this, but I just employ people to like, you know, to create. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4382.740000000001s)]
*  Like this technique. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4385.740000000001s)]
*  But yeah, that's my way of like, now he has his ancestors. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4386.740000000001s)]
*  You know, he has his people from his tribe. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4390.740000000001s)]
*  And even when I fought Rob the first time in Melbourne, I felt something with him. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4392.740000000001s)]
*  I've never really spoken on this, but like everyone has something. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4399.740000000001s)]
*  I have my parents fasting and praying. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4402.740000000001s)]
*  I have my uncle who was a pastor, prayer warriors back in Nigeria praying for me. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4404.740000000001s)]
*  So yeah, but also we all tap into it because we're indigenous people. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4408.740000000001s)]
*  We know how to tap into the spirituality of things. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4412.740000000001s)]
*  So he definitely has an energy behind him that just props him up, gets him going. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4414.84s)]
*  And it's hard to explain unless you've been in there with someone. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4421.84s)]
*  And if like, if you have, you'll know. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4423.84s)]
*  It's in the eyes, it's in the energy, it's the spirit. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4426.84s)]
*  So you can clown me and say, oh, it's fucking woo woo, whatever. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4428.84s)]
*  But again, in the Western world, no one really fucks with that. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4432.84s)]
*  It's all about science and energies and crystals and all that. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4434.84s)]
*  But you felt it with Rob? [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4437.84s)]
*  Because Rob's what, Maori? [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4438.84s)]
*  Maori, yeah. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4439.84s)]
*  It was something different. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4440.84s)]
*  And also maybe my thing with the death note, I don't know. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4441.9400000000005s)]
*  But yeah, also he's the Grim Reaper apparently. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4444.9400000000005s)]
*  But I felt it with Rob, it was something. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4447.9400000000005s)]
*  But you know, this is things I don't like to, because I grew up in Nigeria. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4450.9400000000005s)]
*  I've seen people get possessed. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4454.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4456.9400000000005s)]
*  I've seen, David, remember at the house in Shanghisha when that lady, do you remember? [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4457.9400000000005s)]
*  I was in the fire. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4463.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh yeah, now you remember. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4465.9400000000005s)]
*  But then this, yeah, I've seen some shit. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4466.9400000000005s)]
*  Wait, what happened? [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4468.9400000000005s)]
*  Now, she was in here talking. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4470.04s)]
*  Let's fucking go. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4472.04s)]
*  Okay, so this one, this one. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4474.04s)]
*  Mark's locked in overload right now. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4477.04s)]
*  He's a witness to divine creation. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4479.04s)]
*  Our other brother, Sam, he lived in Nigeria longer than us, and then he came to join us [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4483.04s)]
*  in New Zealand. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4488.04s)]
*  And he came with so many stories. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4489.04s)]
*  Like one time after school, one of the students picked up a rubber band and turned into a [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4491.04s)]
*  yam. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4497.14s)]
*  And then everyone said, oh, they've turned into a yam. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4498.14s)]
*  And they cut the yam open. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4500.14s)]
*  And then there was blood. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4501.14s)]
*  And I was like, you're a cap, and you're lying, you're lying. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4502.14s)]
*  And then I went to our dad, and I was like, is this true? [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4504.14s)]
*  And he's like, like these things happen, like, like no cap. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4508.14s)]
*  And he's not in a bullshit, like he's not like a, you know what I mean? [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4512.14s)]
*  He doesn't need a fuck clout. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4515.14s)]
*  I've seen some stuff in boarding school. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4516.14s)]
*  He's a great voice. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4518.14s)]
*  He's a voice over actor. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4519.14s)]
*  You went to hear his laugh. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4520.14s)]
*  When he laughs and he's fucking rolling, he's hilarious. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4521.14s)]
*  It's a little discouraging we haven't heard that in an hour and a half. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4524.14s)]
*  I'm working over here. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4526.240000000001s)]
*  That's true. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4529.240000000001s)]
*  That's true. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4530.240000000001s)]
*  I've seen some stuff. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4531.240000000001s)]
*  And the one I was talking about in the house, after school, we used to just hear random [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4532.240000000001s)]
*  noises from the house above us constantly just, she's speaking in tongues. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4536.240000000001s)]
*  And then one night, I remember like maybe around two or three a.m., the whole house, [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4541.240000000001s)]
*  there was commotion. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4547.240000000001s)]
*  And then they took her to a church or something to go pray. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4548.240000000001s)]
*  And then I tried to see her. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4550.240000000001s)]
*  My parents were like, just go in your room, go in your room and lock the door. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4551.240000000001s)]
*  And then I try to ask the housemaids the next day what happened. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4554.34s)]
*  But everyone just kept, you know, ah, whatever, whatever. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4557.34s)]
*  But I found out later on it was she passed the thing on. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4560.34s)]
*  It was a housemaid from upstairs. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4564.34s)]
*  She passed it to the mom and the mom passed it to the kids. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4566.34s)]
*  And then the dad was the only one who didn't get touched by it. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4569.34s)]
*  But then they had to like do this whole exorcist shit. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4571.34s)]
*  This sounds crazy, like some fucking movie shit. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4574.34s)]
*  But it happens. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4576.34s)]
*  I've seen it. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4578.34s)]
*  And again, boarding school, I've seen it as well. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4579.34s)]
*  It's real. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4581.34s)]
*  It's real. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4582.4400000000005s)]
*  I don't want to go too much into it because then I just sound like a fucking crazy person. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4583.4400000000005s)]
*  But yeah, I already do. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4585.4400000000005s)]
*  But still, A, A more. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4587.4400000000005s)]
*  What happened at boarding school? [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4589.4400000000005s)]
*  What happened allegedly? [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4591.4400000000005s)]
*  Okay, boarding school, we're playing tag. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4592.4400000000005s)]
*  And then this kid, whenever he got tagged, he just kind of switched and he'd catch on. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4594.4400000000005s)]
*  I started trying to beat them. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4598.4400000000005s)]
*  What the fuck, yo, relax, chill. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4599.4400000000005s)]
*  And later on, we couldn't fight him for hours. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4601.4400000000005s)]
*  And then at one point, ah. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4604.4400000000005s)]
*  At one point, me and this kid who were looking for him, we see in the night, [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4607.4400000000005s)]
*  lightning strike, strikes again, and he's right there running us in slow motion. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4610.54s)]
*  And I'll never forget this because there's moments in your life you just, [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4614.54s)]
*  you just click. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4617.54s)]
*  Let's get out. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4618.54s)]
*  And they just go. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4619.54s)]
*  A guy running in, get out. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4620.54s)]
*  Ah, and then we ran. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4622.54s)]
*  And then people were like, what the fuck? [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4624.54s)]
*  We were like, he's coming, he's coming, he's coming. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4625.54s)]
*  But yeah. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4627.54s)]
*  So did he come? [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4628.54s)]
*  Well, I don't know, fuck, I didn't stay to find out. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4631.54s)]
*  So you, okay. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4633.54s)]
*  Yeah, get the fuck out of there. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4634.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4635.54s)]
*  And eventually they found him. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4636.54s)]
*  They found him later on eventually. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4637.54s)]
*  And he was in the bushes somewhere. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4638.64s)]
*  This is an open state Bell's boarding school. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4639.64s)]
*  They found him eventually in the bushes somewhere. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4641.64s)]
*  And yeah, I think after the next day, we never saw him at school for a while. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4643.64s)]
*  Yeah, Vala's got a story. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4649.64s)]
*  There were some knives that flew off the shelf in Pakistan. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4650.64s)]
*  Remember that? [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4652.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4653.64s)]
*  Wait, what do you mean? [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4654.64s)]
*  Yeah, so I was at my grandma's house whose house was like super haunted. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4655.64s)]
*  It was on a burial site. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4660.64s)]
*  And it was me, my cousins, my aunt who's deaf. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4662.740000000001s)]
*  And all of a sudden, these like steak knives just flew across the room and stabbed my aunt's shirt through the couch. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4668.740000000001s)]
*  Damn. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4680.740000000001s)]
*  And we're all just like, it was my aunt and us, and we're just like screaming, like screaming for help. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4681.740000000001s)]
*  And nobody was there. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4687.740000000001s)]
*  And so my aunt had to like take the knife out and just grab all the kids and run out of the house. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4689.84s)]
*  Did it pierce skin or just the shirt? [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4694.84s)]
*  No, just the shirt. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4695.84s)]
*  Damn. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4696.84s)]
*  Lucky. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4697.84s)]
*  That was your uncle trying to get a dope hole. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4698.84s)]
*  Just for some more experience. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4701.84s)]
*  He's like, oh shit. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4702.84s)]
*  Going to a witch doctor, if you've got problems, your husband's cheating on you or something. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4703.84s)]
*  It's like part of a way of life in some parts of Nigeria. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4707.84s)]
*  You go, they'll do a little sacrifice, they'll kill the chicken. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4710.84s)]
*  They'll give you something, they'll be like, go put it under your doormat. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4713.84s)]
*  And then your husband will just stop cheating on you? [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4717.9400000000005s)]
*  Well, they'll stick something on you, yeah. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4719.9400000000005s)]
*  Like, if this one, trust me, bro, that you should take as a fact, this is it. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4720.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4724.9400000000005s)]
*  Like, this is it. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4725.9400000000005s)]
*  Have you ever used a witch doctor? [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4726.9400000000005s)]
*  Hell no. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4727.9400000000005s)]
*  No, we don't. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4728.9400000000005s)]
*  We grew up in a Christian household, so we stayed away from that. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4729.9400000000005s)]
*  But we call them Babalawo. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4730.9400000000005s)]
*  I think in South Africa they call them Sangoma. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4732.9400000000005s)]
*  So everyone, different tribes in Africa have different names for them. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4734.9400000000005s)]
*  But before Christianity, before all that, these guys were, and it's not because the Western [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4738.9400000000005s)]
*  world would say this is bad, this is juju, this is nyan, but then it was African spirituality [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4744.64s)]
*  before Christianity or whatever came through, even as life. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=4749.64s)]

*  Maybe that's it. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5035.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5036.94s)]
*  Maybe we want to believe in supernatural. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5037.94s)]
*  Because you have a God-shamed hole in your heart. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5038.94s)]
*  When you told me shit about the cats, I need to accept Jesus. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5039.94s)]
*  I have accepted Jesus. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5042.94s)]
*  So, I'm still feeling empty, huh? [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5043.94s)]
*  No, but that's why you have so many gods in my head. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5044.94s)]
*  No, there's a, but like I even see like my dog hanging around my child, right? [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5045.94s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't know, I don't know. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5050.94s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5053.94s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5054.94s)]

*  I don't know. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5058.94s)]
*  And I'm like, well, they have a protective instinct and she just knows or whatever. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5060.139999999999s)]
*  Or maybe it's because the people that give her the food are around the child. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5064.139999999999s)]

*  And then my baby tried to like take a toy my dog was playing with and I just saw my dog go, [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5072.139999999999s)]
*  herrrrr. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5078.139999999999s)]

*  That's straight away. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5080.139999999999s)]
*  Oh, that ain't shit. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5081.139999999999s)]
*  These dogs ain't shit at all. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5082.139999999999s)]
*  Do you reprimand them straight away? [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5083.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5085.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you have to. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5086.139999999999s)]
*  Do you reprimand it by throwing the thing continuously for it? [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5087.34s)]
*  Yeah, I reprimand it. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5090.34s)]
*  Don't reward them. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5091.34s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5092.34s)]
*  You're right. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5093.34s)]
*  I have to make sure that behavior is not tolerant. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5094.34s)]
*  Letting other babies up there. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5096.34s)]
*  Is above them. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5097.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5098.34s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5099.34s)]
*  Because that's how kids get. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5100.34s)]
*  But why are we so compelled to want to believe in, is it the supernatural? [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5101.34s)]
*  I think there's so much we don't know. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5106.34s)]
*  Having some explanation for some supernatural phenomenon is like, okay, there are things [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5108.34s)]
*  that are beyond our comprehension that are happening out there. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5112.04s)]
*  Oh, that's interesting. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5114.14s)]
*  It justifies all the things that we can't explain. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5116.14s)]
*  So believing in these little things can justify the greater things that we don't understand. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5119.14s)]
*  Okay, that's interesting perspective. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5124.14s)]
*  The inability to explain things is anxiety-inducing. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5126.14s)]
*  It's like, oh, I say something that can jinx something, but if I knock on wood, I have some control [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5128.14s)]
*  over my future destiny. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5133.14s)]
*  Like those types of superstitions. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5135.14s)]
*  I love knocking on wood. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5137.14s)]
*  And I'm surprised you actually have seen it and you haven't looked into it more. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5138.14s)]
*  No, I don't want to. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5141.14s)]
*  I've never fucked with a Ouija board, nothing like that. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5142.14s)]
*  Because I just know as Nigerians, this is why on these movies, there's always white kids. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5144.14s)]
*  Because they're, oh, yeah, let's go talk to the fucking... [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5148.14s)]
*  You don't see no black kids fuck with that. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5152.14s)]
*  Because I know it's real. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5153.14s)]
*  And then it can enter you. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5155.14s)]
*  You know it can become a thing. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5158.14s)]
*  So I'm just like, nah, I'm good. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5159.14s)]
*  So, yeah. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5161.14s)]
*  Well, you need to holler at some of the witch doctors for your opponents in the future. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5163.14s)]
*  Throw some shit in the locker room. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5167.14s)]
*  I'd write it myself. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5169.14s)]
*  I'd write it myself. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5170.14s)]
*  Skills, skills. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5171.14s)]
*  Gotta get the edge on them. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5172.14s)]
*  Sometimes. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5173.14s)]
*  Bro, even in Nigeria, they do it with football. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5174.14s)]
*  They put something at someone's goalpost. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5177.14s)]
*  Do you remember this in the World Cup? [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5179.14s)]
*  Was it a thing? [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5181.14s)]
*  There was a whole thing in the World Cup. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5182.14s)]

*  Nigeria was winning games. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5184.14s)]
*  They got a call and there was a crow that was on the goalpost. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5186.14s)]
*  There was some shit. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5189.14s)]
*  Say we got a Spongy. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5190.14s)]
*  There's always something. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5191.14s)]
*  They will try. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5192.14s)]
*  Nah, but nothing's free, bro. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5193.14s)]

*  Nah, everything needs a sacrifice. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5212.14s)]
*  Christians, we have the one sacrifice. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5214.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5215.14s)]

*  God is the one, no matter what that force is, it's what we all tap into. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5239.860000000001s)]
*  Call the universe, this is just a euphemism for God. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5242.38s)]

*  put the whole thing on and then I went to pray at the mosque with him and he was really [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5251.740000000001s)]
*  touched. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5256.259999999999s)]
*  He was like, man, none of my friends have ever come to the mosque to pray with me. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5257.259999999999s)]
*  But I was like, of course I'm going to tap in. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5259.5s)]
*  It's a place, and I just went there, followed what he was doing, but I was just meditating. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5261.339999999999s)]
*  I didn't really know the Koran or speak the, you know, Arabic or whatever, but it's just [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5265.58s)]
*  my way of tapping in with cultures. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5269.98s)]
*  No matter what, you still feel the same energy. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5271.46s)]
*  We're all still trying to connect to the same oneness. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5273.0599999999995s)]

*  This is what it's like. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5513.58s)]

*  I don't let them think, bro. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5541.62s)]

*  So in Nigerian or Yoruba culture, when you have a baby, you meet the baby for about a [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5557.66s)]
*  week first. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5562.98s)]
*  So you're in the house with the baby for about a week, get to know the baby a bit. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5563.98s)]
*  Indians do that. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5568.099999999999s)]
*  That's what we have to do. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5569.099999999999s)]
*  And you have the naming ceremony, right? [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5570.099999999999s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5575.099999999999s)]
*  So we don't do baby showers. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5576.099999999999s)]
*  That's a new thing now in Nigeria. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5577.099999999999s)]
*  But we still have naming ceremonies. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5578.099999999999s)]
*  And then, like I say, people from my mom's side and my dad's side, important people, [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5579.38s)]
*  like my mom and dad's parents gave me a different name. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5584.299999999999s)]

*  in my mind. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5939.1s)]

*  We used to just pretend to fight in the fields as a kid. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=5961.1s)]

*  I saw you living it up and awesome. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6351.5s)]
*  Did you do Kill Tony? [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6352.5s)]
*  Nah. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6353.5s)]
*  I thought you were gonna do it, man. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6354.5s)]
*  Nah, because I film on Mondays, but I just wanted to be at the comedy mothership and [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6355.5s)]
*  just see, because again, and I said this for me, I was a fan of these guys and even us, [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6359.5s)]
*  like we're friends now, but me and these guys for the first time, like Hans Kim, Ari and [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6365.98s)]
*  them. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6370.14s)]
*  You've probably watched them so much online. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6371.14s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm just like. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6372.14s)]
*  It's a cool moment to see them. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6373.14s)]
*  This is cool. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6374.14s)]
*  And again, I know for them, they feel the same way, but I'm a fan. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6375.14s)]
*  Trust me, they're way more excited. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6377.66s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, but I'm excited. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6379.86s)]
*  They're way more excited. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6380.86s)]
*  I kept on telling Tony, I was like, I'm so proud of you, seeing this apartment. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6382.26s)]
*  I was like, man, this is fucking cool. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6385.3s)]
*  I told him probably like seven times. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6386.54s)]
*  I like the way he just takes pride in himself, just walking around and showing us like, yeah, [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6388.9400000000005s)]
*  I did this shit. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6393.02s)]
*  Because he's so little, but he's such a boss. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6394.02s)]
*  I mean, it's amazing what they've built that show to be, like Kill Tony. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6397.14s)]
*  It's so good. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6403.74s)]
*  And they built it, man. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6404.74s)]
*  And he's thoughtful about every aspect of it. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6405.74s)]
*  They got it out of the mud. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6407.22s)]
*  Because it was the one at MSG. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6408.22s)]
*  I told him though, at the end, I didn't like the fact that they rushed the second show [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6410.54s)]
*  at the end. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6413.9s)]
*  I was like, what the fuck? [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6414.9s)]
*  That was my complaint. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6415.9s)]
*  Yo, Duff can speak on this. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6416.9s)]
*  But he said it was because Madison Square Garden had a fine for $100K if they went overtime. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6419.02s)]
*  It might even be more. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6424.14s)]
*  True. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6425.14s)]
*  Like, you gotta get out that menu, bro. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6426.14s)]
*  You gotta get out that menu. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6428.14s)]
*  Yeah, because they were just like, the next people didn't even have the buckets. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6430.14s)]
*  They were just like, cool, boom, this guy comes up. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6432.62s)]
*  Like all the comedians that had it in the set, they were like, 30 second sets, cool, [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6434.46s)]
*  thank you, we gotta keep moving. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6439.34s)]
*  And I was just like, hmm. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6441.14s)]
*  But that's just me as a Karen. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6442.14s)]
*  You know what it probably is? [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6445.58s)]
*  There was probably an event the next day and they started loading in that night before. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6446.58s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6450.54s)]
*  Because to you, you're still on at MSG. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6451.54s)]
*  But to the venue, they're like, that's Tuesday. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6453.38s)]
*  Yeah, we got other shows. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6455.34s)]
*  Do you guys have a production trailer whenever you go around the world? [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6457.34s)]
*  Do you have like a set or something that you have to say, lighting or is that supplied [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6460.26s)]
*  by the venue? [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6467.18s)]
*  You wanna know some crazy shit? [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6468.18s)]
*  We were on this tour for months. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6470.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6472.42s)]
*  And I never really like inquired on how like we got all the lights and shit. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6473.42s)]
*  I'm like, I don't have to say. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6478.18s)]
*  You're a fucking mensch. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6481.18s)]
*  Every time I would show up, the lights would be there and I'd be like, hey, that's fire. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6483.42s)]
*  It is astounding how much Dove does and you have no fucking clue. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6486.820000000001s)]
*  Yo, yo, yo, shut up. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6490.42s)]
*  He was trying to out. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6491.42s)]
*  Shut up. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6492.42s)]
*  He was sitting, no, no, he was sitting. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6493.42s)]
*  I showed up to the fucking venue once. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6496.66s)]
*  I forget where we were. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6498.66s)]
*  And there was like two, 18 trucks outside. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6500.14s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6503.14s)]
*  So you guys have that. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6504.14s)]
*  You're a good fucking friend. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6505.14s)]
*  MSG. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6506.14s)]
*  I showed up. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6507.14s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6508.14s)]
*  It wasn't MSG. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6509.14s)]
*  It was somewhere else. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6510.14s)]
*  It was showed up and I walked out and I was like, damn, who's here tomorrow? [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6511.14s)]
*  Because I thought it was like Guns N' Roses or something. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6512.14s)]
*  I was like, who the fuck is performing here? [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6515.14s)]
*  And then I remember Dove and Cheryl like, this is our stuff. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6517.14s)]
*  And I go, we got two trucks? [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6521.14s)]
*  We got four. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6523.14s)]
*  On a big show? [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6524.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6525.14s)]
*  We have four, but it was crazy. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6526.860000000001s)]
*  You see how much money they're wasting? [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6527.860000000001s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6528.860000000001s)]
*  He's definitely on it. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6529.860000000001s)]
*  He's definitely on it. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6530.860000000001s)]
*  He's walking it. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6531.860000000001s)]
*  No, but he didn't even know until, for MSG as an example, like Drake or Travis Scott [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6532.860000000001s)]
*  for an MSG show, that's 25, 35 trucks that are out there. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6539.26s)]
*  Oh shit. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6544.06s)]
*  And we're talking about the 18 wheel, huh? [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6545.06s)]
*  I know the ones. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6546.06s)]
*  And he's talking at MSG, everything needs to be unloaded by forklifts. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6547.06s)]
*  So you've got dozens. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6551.780000000001s)]
*  They're just all lined up ready to unload this. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6553.900000000001s)]
*  You see everybody put it together, but also when they take it apart. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6556.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6559.66s)]
*  On the UFC, they had booked a tiny one ship. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6560.66s)]
*  He didn't know a few days ago from Jelly Roll telling you how many trucks he had. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6562.66s)]
*  And I'm sitting there saying, what time was your loading to get this all up? [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6566.42s)]
*  And he's like, walk and chalk it. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6570.78s)]
*  Three o'clock in the morning. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6572.379999999999s)]
*  And Andrew's like, yeah, what time you're doing that? [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6573.62s)]
*  I was like, yours was at 6 AM. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6576.82s)]
*  He says, I didn't see that. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6577.82s)]
*  I was like, we saw it. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6578.82s)]
*  You walk into an empty shell and there's forklifts outside. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6579.82s)]
*  They build out the whole shell. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6583.82s)]
*  And there's a whistle that blows in the now and the rigging crew comes in. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6586.74s)]
*  And now this. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6588.74s)]
*  So even if you have to go say Abu Dhabi when you do that, do you have to transfer all your [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6589.74s)]
*  stuff over there? [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6593.219999999999s)]
*  You get local vendors. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6594.219999999999s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6595.219999999999s)]
*  I see. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6596.219999999999s)]
*  But like I would say our show is probably has a lot more elements than the average standup [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6597.219999999999s)]
*  show. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6603.38s)]
*  But I would say that Kill Tony is a production too. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6604.38s)]
*  So they'll have multiple trucks. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6606.62s)]
*  But I think the average standup show doesn't do it like that. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6607.82s)]
*  I think a lot of guys just show up and like whatever's here, they do it. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6610.98s)]
*  We did that for years. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6614.3s)]
*  But you'll have flames. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6615.3s)]
*  We just wanted to see what we could do. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6617.3s)]
*  And also, like, there's a part of you that is there's part of you selfishly you want [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6619.3s)]
*  to put on the best show. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6624.3s)]
*  There's also a part of you that like what at least my relationship with the people come [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6625.3s)]
*  out to the shows like they built this with me. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6629.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6632.3s)]
*  Like I have like this insane gratitude. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6633.3s)]
*  I feel so guilty. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6634.3s)]
*  Like if they'll come to me and they'll ask me like, oh, this thing is fucking to put [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6635.3s)]
*  a screen. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6640.3s)]
*  It's another 10 grand. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6641.3s)]
*  But what if the people can't see? [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6642.54s)]
*  Like those people probably came to five shows like and now they're going to be at MSG and [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6644.54s)]
*  that's yeah, we have to spend. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6647.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they got to show you feel you do feel this like immense gratitude. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6649.26s)]
*  I don't know if I'd have to ask a comic that like they were in movies first and then they [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6654.18s)]
*  they did comedy. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6658.9800000000005s)]
*  I wonder if they feel that same like the possibility. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6659.9800000000005s)]
*  I don't know if they do it. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6663.54s)]
*  They might. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6664.54s)]
*  But I feel like it is it has to be the best show they've ever seen. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6665.54s)]
*  Here's a question for you guys. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6669.22s)]
*  Both of you. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6670.22s)]
*  I remember when I filmed my special, I put this all this money into it and I'm like, [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6672.14s)]
*  I don't know what the fuck I'm spending all this money on. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6674.14s)]
*  Then you walk in and you see, I don't know, 50 people, 100 people working on this thing. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6675.900000000001s)]
*  And then you I remember thinking to myself and y'all are doing a much larger scale. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6680.780000000001s)]
*  I remember thinking, oh, all of this is for me. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6684.46s)]
*  And you feel I had to block it out pretty quickly because it's like a lot. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6687.9800000000005s)]
*  But you're like, when you walk in MSG, you walk in MSG, you see all these people working [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6690.9800000000005s)]
*  6 a.m. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6695.1s)]
*  How much pressure do you feel where it's like, oh, all of this is for me. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6696.22s)]
*  I got to fucking deliver, like not just the fans that are coming. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6700.3s)]
*  These people whose jobs are building this stage for me, putting this screen up for me, [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6703.14s)]
*  building this ring for me. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6708.5s)]
*  Do you feel that? [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6709.860000000001s)]
*  Because I felt that for a second and I was like, that will swallow me. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6710.860000000001s)]
*  No, like Xane, it's not my money, it's Dana's money. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6714.1s)]
*  So, you know, that's cool. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6717.38s)]
*  But again, I've heard from behind the scenes, there's only been ever two fighters that do [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6720.62s)]
*  like a ring walk beforehand, like go to the venue the night before. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6725.22s)]
*  That's me and John Jones, the only two that go get prep and just kind of have a little [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6731.38s)]
*  look-see. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6735.46s)]
*  So when I did the one in Melbourne where I danced, I told everyone on the mic, please, [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6736.46s)]
*  I know if you're in the working, just don't film nothing like that, then I did it. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6741.42s)]
*  But then I felt like I'm going to fucking kill this shit. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6746.1s)]
*  I just felt like, I just knew, I didn't really feel pressure because I went to bed that night [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6749.780000000001s)]
*  watching the rehearsal and just, that's how I fell asleep with my phone in my hand, just [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6755.54s)]
*  like, again, this is going to fucking blow. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6758.86s)]
*  So it took my mind off the fight and I was able to just be like, fuck. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6761.82s)]
*  And then, yeah, so it wasn't pressure, I was just like, I'm going to fucking kill this [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6765.3s)]
*  shit. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6769.5s)]
*  That's how I felt. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6770.5s)]
*  Yeah, I don't feel the pressure of that, but I do feel the gratitude of it at the end. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6771.5s)]
*  Like, well, a lot of times go back to the venue and like maybe we'll go to a seat where [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6776.9s)]
*  people are watching. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6781.18s)]
*  Because it's weird, being a human is weird. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6782.86s)]
*  You get used to unbelievable shit. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6785.139999999999s)]
*  Like I'm sure that's what happens with you. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6787.62s)]
*  You get used to going in there like fighting a guy who's trying to kill you. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6789.219999999999s)]
*  People get used to war. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6792.34s)]
*  Like there's just part of being a human being. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6793.38s)]
*  We can get used to these like wild circumstances. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6795.26s)]
*  So you can get used to performing in an arena. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6796.9s)]
*  But since you don't do that often, I've been back at MSG since I performed there and I'm [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6799.34s)]
*  like, we performed here twice. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6806.0199999999995s)]
*  Like your fucking brain explodes when you're looking at another place and that's where [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6809.139999999999s)]
*  the gratitude sets in. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6813.139999999999s)]
*  When you see all the people working to like remove the floor, you start going, whoa, how [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6814.139999999999s)]
*  fucking lucky am I? [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6818.219999999999s)]
*  But it's not daunting beforehand. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6819.74s)]
*  Like there's like one objective. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6821.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the first time I ever felt it, I remember when I was on Wild'n Out and I wasn't even [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6822.379999999999s)]
*  big on Wild'n Out, but we go to the premiere party. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6825.5s)]
*  I bring my friend who's not in the business and he's like, dog, so many people's livelihoods [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6828.179999999999s)]
*  depends on you doing well on this show. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6831.379999999999s)]
*  And not me specifically, but in general. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6834.0599999999995s)]
*  And that was the first time it ever occurred to me. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6835.9s)]
*  And now, again, if I think about it too much, I get overwhelmed. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6837.3s)]
*  But I'm like, fuck, that's always. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6839.900000000001s)]
*  You can't think about it too much. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6841.46s)]
*  You just have to just accept it for it. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6842.7s)]
*  It's like peek at it. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6844.02s)]
*  Like, I understand. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6845.02s)]
*  Okay, this is what it is. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6846.02s)]
*  And the one you talked about was after I fought first time at MSG with Bronson, the next night [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6847.02s)]
*  went to watch the Knicks play. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6851.54s)]
*  And that's when I was kind of like, what the fuck? [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6852.74s)]
*  I remember you going there. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6854.38s)]
*  And I was like, oh shit, this was like, I fought there last night and now it's a fucking, the [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6856.38s)]
*  basketball is a play. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6861.54s)]
*  There's a logo there. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6862.54s)]
*  Derek always says this to us. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6863.54s)]
*  Whenever we're doing an arena, Derek opens the show. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6865.22s)]
*  Derek Post on Polaris. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6867.22s)]
*  Yeah, I saw him in Austin. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6868.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6869.22s)]
*  And he always says this. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6870.22s)]
*  He's like, if we're doing an arena or something, he goes, you know, it takes two basketball [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6871.22s)]
*  teams to sell this out. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6875.06s)]
*  That's a bar. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6876.46s)]
*  That's fire. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6879.46s)]
*  Like if the Knicks just show up, no one's going to sell it out. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6880.46s)]
*  I heard, I mean, I love the Knicks and I don't really follow basketball, but. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6884.900000000001s)]

*  Why they took off his belt? [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6949.18s)]
*  That wasn't even a fight. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6950.18s)]
*  That's a guy getting sheep shotted. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6951.18s)]
*  Why they take his belt off? [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6952.740000000001s)]
*  Nobody else focused on that. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6954.22s)]
*  That is crazy. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6957.22s)]

*  No, fight a fair one. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6964.22s)]
*  It's not even a nice belt. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6965.22s)]

*  Put the shoes back on. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6988.26s)]
*  Asian guy is on. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6989.26s)]
*  It's an Asian guy got a nice wrap. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6990.26s)]
*  Oh, he got a nice wrap. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6991.26s)]
*  The other guy shouldn't have just kept on walking in. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6994.26s)]
*  He did the same thing. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6996.26s)]
*  Oh, that's nice of him though. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=6997.26s)]

*  No, that's disrespect. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7001.26s)]
*  Don't knock me out and then get back. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7002.26s)]
*  I think he came for that. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7005.26s)]
*  White guy, his problem was he was just rushing back in after getting clipped and like, cool, [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7006.26s)]
*  let's do it again. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7009.3s)]
*  That's ego. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7010.3s)]
*  You have to just pull back and reassess and do something different. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7011.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7014.3s)]

*  Spit in his eyes. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7018.3s)]
*  Ah. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7019.3s)]
*  And then you do something. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7020.3s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7021.3s)]
*  What was that guy who would prank the dudes? [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7022.3s)]
*  He'd talk shit and then get naked. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7025.3s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I see that. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7026.3s)]
*  That's so good. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7027.3s)]
*  But again, that's the way to do it though. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7028.3s)]
*  Bro, have you seen that Keaton Peele sketch, man? [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7031.3s)]

*  I've seen it. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7037.34s)]
*  There's a moment where it's Mike Tyson and Jordan Peele is Mike Tyson and he's going [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7038.34s)]
*  up against another boxer. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7042.34s)]
*  I think he's, and he starts saying what he's going to do. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7043.34s)]
*  This boxer's like, I'm going to beat him up. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7045.78s)]
*  The fight promo thing. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7047.78s)]
*  The fight promo. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7048.78s)]
*  And then Mike Tigger goes, I'm going to fuck you in the ass. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7049.78s)]

*  Austin, for sure. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7089.34s)]
*  Sixth Street. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7090.34s)]
*  Sixth Street. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7091.34s)]

*  That's why I have to keep moving. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7127.34s)]
*  I like what he's doing. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7128.34s)]

*  Yeah, appreciate. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7206.38s)]
*  Wow. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7207.38s)]
*  I mean, there's a whole YouTube page with millions of views. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7208.38s)]
*  I like that with Street Fight Companion. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7211.74s)]
*  Yeah, big capital on this page. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7213.46s)]
*  Freestyle Bender. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7215.46s)]
*  Yeah, but David, Street Fight, he's the producer of Freestyle Bender, so he kind of lets us [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7216.46s)]
*  know if it's kosher, if you will, on brand. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7223.58s)]
*  Street Fight Companion. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7226.98s)]
*  Would you do any commentating? [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7227.98s)]
*  Not now. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7230.74s)]
*  The breakdowns that I do, I give really basic insights into things. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7232.139999999999s)]
*  I don't try and give the sauce. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7236.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7238.26s)]
*  I don't want people to know how I think. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7239.26s)]
*  I did a little bit for, during COVID, when I did the breakdowns early on of my old fights, [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7240.74s)]
*  and they usually was kind of like, still that shit. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7246.58s)]
*  Oh, you're giving away the juice. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7247.58s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7248.58s)]
*  Okay, my bad. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7249.58s)]
*  But like, let's say one day in the future, 20 years from now, something like that, would [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7250.58s)]
*  that be something? [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7252.58s)]
*  That'd be fun. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7253.58s)]
*  That'd be fun. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7254.58s)]
*  You and Valk, dude, together, just commentating after you both retire, it'd be so good. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7255.58s)]
*  I mean, I'd do some for the UFC, just for fun, for the lulls. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7258.82s)]
*  Sorry, you know how the NFL, I don't know if you watch NFL football, but they do a Manning [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7261.82s)]
*  cast on Monday nights, who are both Manning brothers. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7266.179999999999s)]
*  They have the regular commentary, but you can also go to ESPN2 or whatever. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7268.82s)]
*  Payne and Eli Manning, just talking during a game. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7271.66s)]
*  You and Valk doing that, you and Vulcan Hooker doing that, could be just so good. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7275.9s)]
*  Just viewing and just kind of like what we're going to do tonight, just watch party type [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7279.94s)]
*  shit. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7282.74s)]
*  It's also fun because, and like, that's why I think having a guy like DC in there is so [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7283.74s)]
*  valuable. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7287.219999999999s)]
*  Michael Bissbing, fighter, former champions. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7288.66s)]
*  Like having people who have been in there and they may or may not know what the fighters [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7291.46s)]
*  feel. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7295.54s)]
*  Sometimes they be saying some shit. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7296.54s)]
*  No, no, they get it wrong. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7297.54s)]
*  Yeah, no, no, not even that. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7298.54s)]
*  It's like their emotions get the best of them. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7299.54s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm like, be neutral. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7302.06s)]
*  You can see it. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7304.42s)]
*  Oh, really? [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7305.42s)]
*  Yeah, you can see it. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7306.42s)]
*  But again, that's why you have professionals like John Anik and Rogan as well, who can [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7307.42s)]
*  just try and be, even if Rogan is a friend with someone like John Anik, they can kind [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7311.14s)]
*  of like separate themselves. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7313.820000000001s)]
*  But fighters, we are emotional beings. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7316.3s)]
*  So we sometimes like Michael Bissbing, shout out to him because one time in Vegas, my second [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7318.660000000001s)]
*  or first year in the UFC, no, first year in the UFC after I fought Bratavirus, he comes, [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7324.46s)]
*  I'm at a pool party, I'm shirtless, and he comes up, sees me, gets on the fucking bar. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7329.22s)]
*  There's the fucking guy, takes his shirt off and all this. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7333.860000000001s)]
*  But then we have a real DNM and he tells me like, you know, I probably said a lot of things [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7336.9800000000005s)]
*  about you out of jealousy. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7342.02s)]
*  Oh, that was cool from the start. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7343.02s)]
*  I appreciated that. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7344.74s)]
*  And then he gave me some game. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7345.74s)]
*  And then at the end of the night, he goes, check this. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7346.9s)]
*  He pops his eye out. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7350.54s)]
*  I'm drunk. He's drunk. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7351.54s)]
*  And I'm like, what the fuck is that? [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7352.66s)]
*  Hold it. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7353.46s)]
*  And he's telling me like, yo, this is the sacrifice you have to make sometimes. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7354.46s)]
*  You have to be careful who you fight, this and that. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7359.46s)]
*  Make sure you get in here, do your thing, get your money and get out because this and [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7361.22s)]
*  this and that. And I'm like, cool. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7365.66s)]
*  He's like, yeah, careful, careful. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7366.46s)]
*  Cool. Give it back to him. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7367.62s)]
*  And then that was it. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7370.139999999999s)]
*  So again, that's one of those moments. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7371.139999999999s)]
*  Crazy. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7373.26s)]
*  I don't know if we took that. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7374.1s)]
*  I took a photo with Jorge that night, but I don't think I took a photo with Bisping. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7375.1s)]
*  But that was a moment for about 40 minutes. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7379.34s)]
*  We hung out, drank, and then we had that moment where we just talked for about 20 minutes [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7381.3s)]
*  after and just like, oh shit. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7386.3s)]
*  And he put his eye on my hand to let me know this is some real shit. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7387.58s)]
*  This is what could happen if you don't play the game right. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7391.06s)]
*  So, yeah, I appreciate those moments. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7394.5s)]
*  Even with GSP, he always pops in into my life, kind of like Avatar Roku in a way. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7396.3s)]
*  OK. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7401.660000000001s)]
*  He'll just pop into my life. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7402.38s)]
*  Like in Austin, he just showed up and again, dropping wisdom. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7403.42s)]
*  Boom, boom. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7406.9400000000005s)]
*  And I'm like, yes, I need this. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7408.54s)]
*  Thank you, master. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7410.46s)]
*  It's a missed. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7413.46s)]
*  Like having those people who've had that experience, like going from nowhere to the top. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7414.34s)]
*  And you're now one of these people. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7420.14s)]
*  It's interesting because like the behavior of most, I'm not saying this is you, but the [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7422.9s)]
*  behavior of most when like they're at the bottom and nobody notices them, there's like [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7426.78s)]
*  freedom to that because you say wild shit about the people at the top because they're [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7430.94s)]
*  these mythical figures. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7434.74s)]
*  They're not real. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7436.259999999999s)]
*  You've never met them. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7437.139999999999s)]
*  So they don't have families. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7438.7s)]
*  They don't have emotions or whatever. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7440.179999999999s)]
*  And like I've even noticed that like in our business is like you start to get a little [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7441.42s)]
*  bit higher and then you start meeting these people and then you realize everything you [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7444.9s)]
*  say on a podcast. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7448.5s)]
*  Everybody hears about it. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7449.86s)]
*  Like Kamala watched us do the the rants for the rest. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7452.179999999999s)]
*  One hundred percent. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7456.0199999999995s)]
*  Or at least someone on her team. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7456.78s)]
*  And you start going, oh, wow, like these people are these people, human beings. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7458.7s)]
*  And then you start going like you got to really believe what you say or really believe in [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7462.9s)]
*  the jokes of it. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7468.26s)]
*  We're at a point now where like everybody hears. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7469.0199999999995s)]
*  And it's something you think about, like when you start meeting them and you meet a lot [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7471.0599999999995s)]
*  of people that you think might suck that end up not sucking and they end up being kind [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7474.099999999999s)]
*  of like good people who are a little bit misunderstood or they really want to be famous. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7479.38s)]
*  So maybe they do something that once you meet them, you're like, oh, you don't even really [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7483.38s)]
*  believe that. But you want to have success for whatever reason. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7487.46s)]
*  You start to have like a lot more empathy for them. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7489.62s)]
*  You humanize them. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7491.3s)]
*  Yeah, 100 percent. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7492.1s)]
*  And yeah, that's just like it is just a wild experience. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7493.46s)]
*  Speaking of which, you trained with Zuck, right? [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7498.18s)]
*  Zuck. Yeah, that was fun. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7500.1s)]
*  Like Zuck to me is not like a human being. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7501.54s)]
*  So I can say whatever I want about him. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7503.54s)]
*  And then you meet him. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7505.06s)]
*  He's a fucking he is a human being. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7505.78s)]
*  Yeah, he's got a wife and some kids. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7507.54s)]
*  Bro, I love his setup. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7509.14s)]
*  Again, I love who he is as a person. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7511.54s)]
*  And when I went to spar him, I let him know. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7514.18s)]
*  I was like, OK, because he invited us to his house. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7517.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7520.18s)]
*  And what a privilege. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7520.82s)]
*  This is the house with the bunker. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7521.62s)]
*  No, not the one where I was. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7522.74s)]
*  We're at Tahoe. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7524.98s)]
*  And again, he's got a great setup. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7526.34s)]
*  I love his setup. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7527.78s)]
*  It's similar to what I have in mind for myself. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7528.5s)]
*  And then when we went to the gym to train and it was time to spar, [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7532.58s)]
*  I was like, right, too close. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7535.94s)]
*  Pop. Cool. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7537.22s)]
*  OK, you're too close. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7538.42s)]
*  Pop. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7539.94s)]
*  And then he was he was learning. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7540.42s)]
*  He was learning on the fly. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7541.62s)]
*  And then he throw a leg kick. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7542.82s)]
*  And again, hard leg kick, but I can take it. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7544.42s)]
*  And then we were just going at it. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7546.9s)]
*  But I didn't try to hurt him. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7548.0199999999995s)]
*  I was just letting him know, like, if you really want to be about this, [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7548.9s)]
*  you have to be about this. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7551.3s)]
*  And I respect the guy. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7552.42s)]
*  He's game, bro. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7553.22s)]
*  He is game. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7554.5s)]
*  Like he his technique's a lot better now. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7555.22s)]
*  He had ACL surgery, I think. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7557.3s)]
*  So he's getting better. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7558.82s)]
*  But he's just passionate about the game. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7559.7s)]
*  This is you wouldn't expect from a guy like that who is accomplished. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7562.82s)]
*  And this is the guy that fucking owns Facebook and Instagram. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7566.18s)]
*  So for me, just to hang out with him and again, humanize him. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7570.26s)]
*  At the end, I was like, man, you're a lot cooler than I expected. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7573.7s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7578.34s)]
*  Just hanging out with him. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7578.9800000000005s)]
*  I feel like his rebrand has gone really well. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7579.78s)]
*  Insane. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7581.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7581.86s)]
*  All right. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7582.34s)]
*  What a way. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7582.82s)]
*  There was an idea of him. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7583.22s)]
*  And now that idea has changed completely. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7584.42s)]
*  But that's because it was through either the movie and people just [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7586.9s)]
*  their own perception till he decided to start being more active on social media [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7590.1s)]
*  and let people know who he is. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7593.62s)]
*  People only know what you share. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7594.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7595.86s)]
*  And if you share a certain thing that people tend to judge, [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7596.18s)]
*  there is a little reflection on that where you go, oh, wait a minute. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7598.74s)]
*  Maybe I'm partially responsible for this. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7601.54s)]
*  But now most people don't think that unless collectively it happens as individuals, [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7603.78s)]
*  they don't. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7608.26s)]
*  Then they follow the crowd and like, oh, I guess he's cool now. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7608.74s)]
*  I'm going to jump on the trend. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7611.3s)]
*  Yes. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7612.58s)]
*  So yeah. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7613.0599999999995s)]
*  But he's a cool dude. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7614.0199999999995s)]
*  I always have respect for that guy. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7614.9s)]
*  You ever met him? [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7616.179999999999s)]
*  I've never met him. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7617.0599999999995s)]
*  Now you never get along. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7617.86s)]
*  At first when you meet him, he's a little awkward. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7619.94s)]
*  Not standoffish, just awkward. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7622.5s)]
*  But then once you get to know him, he's cool. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7624.0199999999995s)]
*  He's just a regular dude. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7626.74s)]
*  You think some of it is getting humbled through fighting, essentially? [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7627.94s)]
*  I would imagine that. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7632.74s)]
*  Maybe training would be. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7633.54s)]
*  Training because definitely every day you get humbled. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7634.74s)]
*  Every day. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7637.0599999999995s)]
*  There's no fake humility in fighting. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7637.78s)]
*  It's not this like, oh, I want to act like I'm not. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7639.379999999999s)]
*  You get your ass kicked. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7642.339999999999s)]
*  You know you suck. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7643.62s)]
*  You get better and then you do it to someone else and then you suck again. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7644.5s)]
*  So yeah, I think so. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7647.379999999999s)]
*  I think definitely fighting would have helped him because, [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7648.339999999999s)]
*  and again, for someone to actually want to do that, crazy. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7650.82s)]
*  And I respect that. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7655.46s)]
*  Someone who actually wants to get in there professionally, [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7656.5s)]
*  even if it's against Elon or whoever else. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7659.3s)]
*  But he still will fight. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7661.22s)]
*  I don't think Elon would fight him, but I think he will definitely fight. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7662.34s)]
*  I think it's a good exercise, though, for powerful people. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7665.38s)]
*  Because when you're as powerful as he is, right? [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7668.74s)]
*  And we're not talking about just like regular power. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7672.02s)]
*  Like every country, if he wants to call up a prime minister, he can. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7674.18s)]
*  Boom, easy. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7677.62s)]
*  Because think about the influence that Facebook has in that country. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7678.42s)]
*  Worldwide. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7681.94s)]
*  I imagine a part of Elon buying Twitter is his ability to access every single leader in the world. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7683.46s)]
*  Hey, I own this platform. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7690.02s)]
*  Yeah, was that it? [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7693.78s)]
*  Was that it? [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7694.42s)]
*  Okay, yeah. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7694.82s)]
*  So I didn't know if it was an off-camera thing or? [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7695.3s)]
*  No, he's on camera. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7697.7s)]
*  Okay, so Mark Cuban was on and he was saying that. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7698.42s)]
*  What an influence you have on the world. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7702.1s)]
*  So Zuckerberg has it. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7704.5s)]
*  And once you have that kind of power, people are, they might not be real with you. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7706.02s)]
*  And you're not a real person to them. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7711.7s)]
*  And things get intoxicated by them. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7713.62s)]
*  Of course. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7715.299999999999s)]
*  So like once you start doing something that is humbling, it could be a sport. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7715.62s)]
*  It could be playing basketball and just getting fucking dunked on. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7718.179999999999s)]
*  But fighting is probably the ultimate humbling. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7720.66s)]
*  Because you have to realize in that moment while you're being choked out, [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7722.58s)]
*  this person is choosing to not kill me. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7725.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, all the money in the world can't save you from death. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7726.82s)]
*  Nothing can stop that. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7728.82s)]
*  And maybe he's clearly a smart guy, but maybe he's smart enough to realize that like his psyche needs that. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7730.419999999999s)]
*  His psyche needs to be reminded. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7736.74s)]
*  You're just a dude. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7739.0599999999995s)]
*  I think men are starting to understand like it's not just about it's brand and bronze, [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7740.1s)]
*  and you can be the richest this and that. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7743.780000000001s)]
*  But then that you talk about that power dynamic. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7745.38s)]
*  That's why all these fucking Wall Street guys go pay hookers to like lash them and shit on their chest. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7747.620000000001s)]
*  You know what they do? [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7752.1s)]
*  There's this thing called a white collar boxing in New York where they all, there would be these like Wall Street dudes. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7752.660000000001s)]
*  We have that in New Zealand. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7757.46s)]
*  Yeah, like all these guys who, not Wall Street, but like businessmen, they do the charity boxing thing. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7759.22s)]
*  So they train for maybe eight, nine weeks and then enter a boxing fight. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7763.780000000001s)]
*  And then they do the smokers. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7766.18s)]
*  And we call them smokers here. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7767.780000000001s)]
*  Like a non-sanctioned, like enter fight. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7769.46s)]
*  But like I think a part of it is like, hey, I need one to get out the energy. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7771.3s)]
*  But also there's like a nice humbling. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7775.54s)]
*  They need it. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7777.3s)]
*  You need it to like learn in Fight Club. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7777.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, Fight Club. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7780.02s)]
*  Yeah, facts. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7781.06s)]
*  100%. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7782.02s)]
*  No, it's good. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7782.900000000001s)]
*  It is- [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7783.54s)]
*  Bring that back. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7783.9400000000005s)]
*  Did Zuck say he actually wants to compete? [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7785.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7788.1s)]
*  Like professionally? [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7788.34s)]
*  Even without the, because the Elon fight was like the thing that made it really popular between them two. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7789.3s)]
*  He said after that- [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7795.3s)]
*  Not professionally, but like to enter a tournament. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7795.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7797.9400000000005s)]
*  Like a smoker, but you'll fight someone that's equally, because he did the Jiu-Jitsu comp. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7798.820000000001s)]
*  And again, shot to him, he did it under a different name till he walked on the mat. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7803.14s)]
*  And the people were like, oh shit. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7806.34s)]
*  And that was smart. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7807.46s)]
*  So that way, if people don't know, I'm fighting Zuck. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7808.740000000001s)]
*  So then he did it under a different name, put up on the mat. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7810.740000000001s)]
*  And those who saw it saw it and he did well. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7813.22s)]
*  He won the fight. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7814.9800000000005s)]
*  So yeah, I think he will at that level. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7815.780000000001s)]
*  Not like again, professionally, just someone who can hang with him. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7819.700000000001s)]
*  It's very easy to, when you get successful, to stop doing hard things. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7822.34s)]
*  You have to do hard things. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7827.9400000000005s)]
*  I always say this to Joe, but it's like doing, he's addicted to making himself uncomfortable. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7829.22s)]
*  And it's why he's so great is he's not afraid to constantly make himself uncomfortable. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7834.02s)]
*  And once you get money, it's very easy to be comfortable. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7839.06s)]
*  And you see like the kids of wealthy people, oftentimes they shy away from discomfort. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7842.26s)]
*  Because they don't ever have to be discomfort. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7848.820000000001s)]
*  They never have to be. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7850.1s)]
*  Think of the level of discomfort you had to go through to get where you are. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7850.660000000001s)]
*  You have to go live in China. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7853.780000000001s)]
*  Fuck Chinese women. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7855.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7856.9800000000005s)]
*  Oh no, that wasn't comfortable. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7857.4800000000005s)]
*  That was good. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7858.34s)]
*  That was comfortable. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7859.06s)]
*  That was really good. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7859.7s)]
*  That was fine. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7860.34s)]
*  They're good at that. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7860.9800000000005s)]
*  There's a billion of them. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7861.46s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7863.86s)]
*  But like the amount of fucked up shit you had to go through, right? [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7864.58s)]
*  And it's like, if you just stop making yourself uncomfortable, [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7868.34s)]
*  what would happen up here? [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7871.3s)]
*  Something, there's going to be a change. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7872.18s)]
*  I've been there. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7873.62s)]
*  There's ways I felt when I'm like, I could feel it. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7874.66s)]
*  Like, okay, I got to find a way to just. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7876.9800000000005s)]
*  You get antsy. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7878.58s)]
*  The last, bro, every time I'm about to, every night before I hop into the cold pool, [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7880.34s)]
*  my brain would always try and stop me. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7885.38s)]
*  So I'll override that by just like, no, I'm the master of my own body. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7887.54s)]
*  And I just boom, straight away dive in there, feel the thing, [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7890.900000000001s)]
*  being there for two minutes, go in the spa. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7894.1s)]
*  Then again, but the first one, it's always just that your brain's like, no, no. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7895.54s)]
*  You're just like walking through and I just boom, dive in. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7900.82s)]
*  So again, you do that reps, you kind of calcify your mind. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7903.78s)]
*  You make yourself the master of your own destiny [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7906.82s)]
*  and it transfers into other bits of your life where you just, I have to go. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7908.900000000001s)]
*  So this camp, I'm gonna find other ways to make myself uncomfortable. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7912.82s)]
*  Might start going yoga because I don't really have a camp yet. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7916.179999999999s)]
*  So I'm just, I have some free time. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7918.82s)]
*  So I'll maybe do something different. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7921.139999999999s)]
*  Like yoga is nice. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7922.42s)]
*  What else? [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7924.34s)]
*  I can't stretch like, you know, these lululemon chicks. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7925.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7928.099999999999s)]
*  You know, so I want to get to that level. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7928.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7930.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7931.38s)]
*  You want to be able to stretch like them. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7931.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7933.219999999999s)]
*  Get some fucking. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7933.78s)]
*  I feel like you're flexible. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7934.82s)]
*  You could do all the kicking and everything. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7935.94s)]
*  I'm flexible, but again, I'm 35. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7937.7s)]
*  It's different, bro. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7940.98s)]
*  So I'm not the same. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7942.02s)]
*  Sometimes if I am not striking as often as I should be, [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7943.06s)]
*  takes me about a week and a half maybe to get my back. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7949.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh, really? [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7953.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7954.580000000001s)]
*  But when I was younger, bro, I'd be out all night. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7955.06s)]
*  Get out of bed. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7958.1s)]
*  Fuck somebody. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7959.22s)]
*  Bro, not even sleep. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7959.700000000001s)]
*  Go to sparring and yeah, but I can't do that anymore [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7960.660000000001s)]
*  because I'm older and I'm smarter now. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7963.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7964.740000000001s)]
*  So I'm not as wild as I used to be, but still, time and place. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7965.3s)]
*  Yes, there's a time and place. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7968.820000000001s)]
*  Guys, anything else for the one, the only, the last style vendor? [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7970.82s)]
*  I don't know if you can talk about this, [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7975.38s)]
*  but the UFC recently settled the class action lawsuit [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7976.9s)]
*  with like a bunch of fighters. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7981.62s)]
*  Are all the fighters included in that class action? [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7984.339999999999s)]
*  I think it's from a certain period. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7987.139999999999s)]
*  So I don't really know too much about it, [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7989.219999999999s)]
*  but I think it's from a certain period. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7990.5s)]
*  And I don't even know if it's still going on. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7992.099999999999s)]
*  I think maybe he rejected it. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7993.78s)]
*  So it's going to, yeah, is they going to do a mistrial, I think? [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7996.5s)]
*  They're going to do an actual trial instead of a settlement. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=7999.86s)]
*  I see. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8001.78s)]
*  Okay. So the judge did reject it, but again, it doesn't include me, [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8002.5s)]
*  includes some fighters from a certain time period. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8005.62s)]
*  So yeah, that'll be interesting. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8008.259999999999s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8009.62s)]
*  Anything else? [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8012.98s)]
*  That's a good answer. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8013.86s)]
*  You're media trained, bro. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8016.58s)]
*  Oh, we're going to talk about the film? [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8019.62s)]
*  Yeah. You saw the film. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8021.0599999999995s)]
*  This is so crazy. We saw it over a year ago. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8022.42s)]
*  Yeah. Look, so I'll say this. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8024.339999999999s)]
*  It was just sometimes some people can't see the forest for the trees. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8027.06s)]
*  And I've always said, I'm not local, I'm global. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8030.740000000001s)]
*  And at least now the movie can globally be seen. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8034.18s)]
*  And I'm happy about that because you've seen it. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8037.780000000001s)]
*  You saw what it was. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8040.5s)]
*  It wasn't really a fight documentary. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8041.14s)]
*  It was a fight documentary, but it was more about, say, [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8043.14s)]
*  me dealing with this lifestyle, the spotlight. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8046.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8049.700000000001s)]
*  And for me, the best picture I saw was a lady on a plane knitting, [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8050.66s)]
*  an old lady on a plane knitting watching it. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8054.74s)]
*  And someone sent me that and I thought that was cool. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8056.74s)]
*  So that way it shows that it's not just a film about a fighter. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8059.38s)]
*  There's a few storylines, but what a magical one that when they're making it, [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8063.139999999999s)]
*  they didn't know that you're going to beat Peretta the second time. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8068.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. But again, they hurried it up because again, sometimes some people... [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8071.38s)]
*  But that is included. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8076.34s)]
*  I think at the end, but they rushed that bit because I think they stopped filming [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8077.38s)]
*  before the Pereira-New York fight. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8084.02s)]
*  So then the film was then imposed while that was happening. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8086.580000000001s)]
*  So they kind of put that bit at the end. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8089.620000000001s)]
*  But again, the story's still being written. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8091.46s)]
*  But right now, this film... [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8093.700000000001s)]
*  It's about you and your fight with your own life and how you're coping with these things. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8095.14s)]
*  Yeah. I think that is. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8100.1s)]
*  But there'll be another thing I think about that saga with you and Alex. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8101.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8105.38s)]
*  And I think that that would be... [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8105.860000000001s)]
*  30 for 30. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8107.22s)]
*  Yeah. I think you got to get Bill Simmons or something like that to do it. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8108.26s)]
*  He was the guy who started the 30 for 30, so I'm not mistaken, right? [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8112.02s)]
*  Yeah. I think it's got to be that caliber. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8114.9800000000005s)]
*  But this is great because this is if you're a real fan of you, [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8119.780000000001s)]
*  you get to explore an emotional side of you that you'll share on pods and that kind of stuff. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8123.14s)]
*  But you're crying in it. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8127.780000000001s)]
*  You're really talking about what makes you insecure, what makes you uncomfortable. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8129.780000000001s)]
*  This is the most exposed I've ever felt on TV. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8133.9400000000005s)]
*  So even the first time I got on a plane and I realized, oh shit, my film's on the plane. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8136.82s)]
*  I shut down. So I got into my seat. There was a whole family. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8143.94s)]
*  And I just like... I was really awkward. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8147.54s)]
*  And in my head, I just assumed people would be watching it or maybe seeing it and then like... [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8150.26s)]
*  And I just felt so insecure about it. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8157.38s)]
*  I'm fine now. But that was the first time. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8159.46s)]
*  I might have had an edible or something, so it made me more sensitive. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8161.7s)]
*  But then I was just very like, oh shit, I didn't want to be seen. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8164.18s)]
*  So I just shut down for the rest of the flight. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8167.62s)]
*  But I'm fine with it now, exposing myself. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8169.700000000001s)]
*  And now it's going to be seen in North America. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8172.18s)]
*  I think it's on Prime and Apple TV. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8174.58s)]
*  And Apple TV. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8175.9400000000005s)]
*  Globally. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8177.14s)]
*  Even YouTube, you can rent it. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8177.54s)]
*  Oh yeah. But again, it's like, cool, this is me. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8178.66s)]
*  I'm a human being. I'm a human animal. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8182.42s)]
*  I have a range of emotions that can be seen in this film from when I was a kid to now. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8183.860000000001s)]
*  But again, if people are going to take whatever they want to take from this, [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8189.860000000001s)]
*  I'd say I practice what I preach when I talk about people [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8194.98s)]
*  dealing with their mental health because they don't want to get mentally ill, like physically. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8197.62s)]
*  And I actually show them how to do it. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8201.54s)]
*  Because most people who don't, they think, oh, I'm not crazy. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8203.86s)]
*  I'm going to go see some therapist or whatever. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8206.1s)]
*  But then I'm showing you, this is, it's simple. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8207.94s)]
*  Last time I went, I'll talk to Janet, would have been a month ago. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8210.58s)]
*  Before that, I didn't realize when she told me, Izzy, it's been three years. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8214.58s)]
*  And I was like, really? [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8217.54s)]
*  Wow. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8218.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8219.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah, fuck. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8219.54s)]
*  So I was like, holy shit. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8220.5s)]
*  And I just thought maybe like a year. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8221.54s)]
*  She's like, no, Izzy, it's been three years. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8222.9s)]
*  I was like, are you serious? [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8224.1s)]
*  So yeah. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8225.38s)]
*  But then life, the tools I got from her, right, helped me deal with a lot of things. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8226.1s)]
*  And I just, cool. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8230.74s)]
*  But then there's the residuals you don't know about that just pile up. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8231.94s)]
*  And then you just, I'll deal with that later, but you don't know you're doing that. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8234.98s)]
*  And they got piled up to a point that after that incident with the fucking dickhead, [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8238.34s)]
*  I was just like, nah, fuck this. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8243.38s)]
*  So I kind of shut down. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8244.66s)]
*  And then I like, yo, Janet, can we talk? [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8245.699999999999s)]
*  Got some stuff off. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8249.3s)]
*  I didn't want to bombard her. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8250.02s)]
*  So when I get back home now, I'll talk to her about some new stuff and be like, right, [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8251.14s)]
*  I got this to deal with now. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8255.619999999999s)]
*  I mean, pile up homework. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8256.9s)]
*  So in that movie, when I show people how to do it, you know, I practice it as well. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8258.5s)]
*  And like, yeah, I fall off. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8264.5s)]
*  Like I said, it's been three years. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8266.42s)]
*  Every life change requires a reset. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8267.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8269.46s)]
*  Every single one. [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8270.18s)]
*  Like having a kid. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8271.3s)]
*  Having a kid and like it throws, you think you have it all figured out and then you have a kid [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8272.66s)]
*  and you are back to zero. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8276.9s)]
*  Square one. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8278.34s)]
*  And you have to re-figure it all out. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8278.9s)]
*  I mean, that's the important of having like a partner that's down to figure it out with you. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8280.82s)]
*  Because that shit is, that's why you got to choose that partner wisely. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8284.26s)]
*  But I imagine in your life, every trying to become champion, becoming champion, like losing [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8288.9s)]
*  the belt, gaining the belt, like all these things. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8296.66s)]
*  What is my new identity without the belt? [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8299.78s)]
*  Now I got it again. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8301.46s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8302.58s)]
*  Everybody loves me now that I have the belt again. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8303.38s)]
*  But I'm aware of it. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8306.58s)]
*  Maybe they never stopped loving me. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8306.9s)]
*  I'm aware. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8308.74s)]
*  Maybe they just like all these things, if you just ignore and put to the side, [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8309.539999999999s)]
*  you're going to deal with them through stress. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8314.099999999999s)]
*  And I thought that's what was cool about the film is you trying to fucking figure it out. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8315.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I still am. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8318.82s)]
*  Constantly. [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8320.019999999999s)]
*  Like even now in this new level, you know, even in my personal life, I try to keep it [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8320.74s)]
*  as private as I can. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8326.419999999998s)]
*  But then in this film, there was one point the director was like, [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8328.099999999999s)]
*  we need a love interest. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8331.3s)]
*  I was like, hell no. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8332.099999999999s)]
*  I knew straight away. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8333.619999999999s)]
*  I was just like, because I knew at the time I was like, this ain't it. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8334.419999999998s)]
*  This ain't the one. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8336.9s)]
*  But there was sort of a love interest. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8338.1s)]
*  Yeah, but then I was like, nah, this ain't the one. [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8343.94s)]
*  Like instinctively, well, it wasn't for me anyway. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8346.34s)]
*  The casting wasn't right. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8351.220000000001s)]
*  But look, I do get like formal, you know, you just had a kid, you did, he just got engaged. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8352.26s)]
*  And the thing is, I'm grateful for is. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8358.98s)]
*  You're engaged? [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8361.140000000001s)]
*  Yeah, David just got engaged. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8362.1s)]
*  And Tahiti did all that. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8363.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8365.54s)]
*  What's his name? [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8366.02s)]
*  No, but she loves you. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8368.1s)]
*  She fucking changed him. [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8372.74s)]
*  Bro, so he lives, they kick me out. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8374.66s)]
*  I just wish no things. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8376.18s)]
*  They were like, I don't know all this credit. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8376.66s)]
*  He did some gruff. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8378.82s)]
*  But watch this, the house that my first house I ever bought, he lives in and they kicked me out. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8379.7s)]
*  Right. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8385.380000000001s)]
*  And then now every time I go there, it's always clean. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8386.34s)]
*  And I'm like, why the fuck was in this place spotless when we lived together? [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8389.300000000001s)]
*  But again, that's because. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8392.26s)]
*  They bring out the best in you, these women, bro. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8393.06s)]
*  She did. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8394.58s)]
*  You get a good one, they bring out the best in you. [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8395.06s)]
*  And I'm proud of him for that because of the growth he's had. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8396.9s)]
*  And I see that. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8399.3s)]
*  And then I was kind of getting to this point where I was just like, man, you know, I'm fine. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8400.18s)]
*  Again, I'm a man, shout out Dick Pride. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8404.74s)]
*  But still, you know, it's like, oh, it'll happen. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8406.82s)]
*  But then when I was golfing with Kelly early this year, he didn't tell me like, yeah, [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8410.82s)]
*  he's about to have a second one. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8414.18s)]
*  I think it's public, not public news, but it's on a story on Instagram or something. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8416.1s)]
*  So he's had a second kid at 52. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8419.7s)]
*  Who? Slater? [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8421.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8422.66s)]
*  A lady. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8423.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8423.78s)]
*  The lady. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8424.02s)]
*  The girl. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8424.66s)]
*  Yeah, my bad, Kelly Slater. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8424.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8425.86s)]
*  That might have been the coolest thing about the sphere is I got to like- [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8426.02s)]
*  Oh, you met him. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8428.5s)]
*  Yeah, he was there. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8429.140000000001s)]
*  That was awesome. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8429.86s)]
*  He's the man. [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8430.34s)]
*  Such a cool dude. [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8430.9s)]
*  He is. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8431.62s)]
*  He doesn't look 52 at all or 53 now maybe, but just had a second kid. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8431.94s)]
*  He's been about to hell forever though. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8435.78s)]
*  He's been locked in. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8436.82s)]
*  And the ocean. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8437.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8438.1s)]
*  The ocean. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8438.42s)]
*  But go on, you were saying. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8438.98s)]
*  Yeah, but yeah, he talked to me about that and kind of him. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8440.34s)]
*  And one thing Bill Burr said years ago, just kind of let me know, like, it's fine. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8442.98s)]
*  There's no rush because if you start rushing, because you know, a lot of these girls, [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8447.220000000001s)]
*  they do that. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8451.140000000001s)]
*  They're trying like, oh, it's like 35, but I need someone and they find the wrong guy, [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8451.54s)]
*  settle down, have a kid with the wrong guy. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8455.22s)]
*  Now you got to deal with that guy for the rest of your life. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8456.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8458.5s)]
*  That ain't me. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8459.06s)]
*  I'm not trying to be that person. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8459.779999999999s)]
*  So yeah, I'm just going to chill and probably one day share this part of my life. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8461.22s)]
*  But at the moment, I like peace. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8466.58s)]
*  I like, and this is where I'm at with peace is just me, myself and I, [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8469.539999999999s)]
*  and then doing all this to better myself will attract not just that, but the best. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8474.099999999999s)]
*  Because already it's attracting the best deals and positions for me. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8478.179999999998s)]
*  Like, look, we've got broke boy. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8483.06s)]
*  We've got his company that's doing well and all these other things that are happening. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8485.06s)]
*  I can't really talk about right now, but it's because I'm just focused on me [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8488.98s)]
*  and being the best me. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8492.66s)]
*  So yeah, I feel like I'm in a good place, but again, still in the race. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8494.18s)]
*  It's still in the race. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8498.5s)]
*  Yeah, I'm still in the race. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8499.22s)]
*  Me too. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8500.019999999999s)]
*  Yeah, me too. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8500.42s)]
*  Me too. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8501.22s)]
*  Even when I was in the last, I said this, I tried to get on Riot for the last two years. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8502.18s)]
*  They're still trying to process me and I was like, you know what? [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8505.22s)]
*  I'm going to get on Hinge just to see what's up. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8507.06s)]
*  But then Hinge is not what I thought it was. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8508.5s)]
*  Nah. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8510.66s)]
*  Wait, what was it? [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8511.38s)]
*  Nah, it's just like the whole fucking questionnaire you have to fix. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8512.74s)]
*  Riot didn't accept you. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8515.06s)]
*  That's some racist shit. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8516.02s)]
*  You're kicking on Riot. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8516.98s)]
*  That's some racist shit. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8517.7s)]
*  That makes me feel, wait, we'll figure out that Riot thing. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8518.66s)]
*  Nah, I don't care. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8521.7s)]
*  Man, Riot was more like, I'm just like, I don't know. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8522.82s)]
*  He's trying to keep you off. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8524.98s)]
*  Let's see what's happening. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8525.54s)]
*  But then it wasn't. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8526.34s)]
*  I was like, still. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8527.22s)]
*  But then Hinge, I was like, they're all looking for something different. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8528.5s)]
*  We're going to make some calls. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8531.86s)]
*  You're going to do some damage on Riot. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8532.66s)]
*  That's what I'm trying to do, man. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8534.18s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8535.3s)]
*  I was trying, but nah. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8536.34s)]
*  We could walk outside for five minutes. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8537.460000000001s)]
*  He'll be fine. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8539.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8539.54s)]
*  If I'm going to get rejected, I'd rather it happen the old fashioned way. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8542.34s)]
*  Real life, face to face. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8544.9s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8546.42s)]
*  Rather than swiping, swiping, swiping. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8547.14s)]
*  Why do you need it dating yet? [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8549.3s)]
*  I don't, but I just thought I'd try it just for the loves. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8551.06s)]
*  Let's just see the girls in Auckland. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8555.86s)]
*  They're not great. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8557.3s)]
*  Vala? [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8559.14s)]

*  That's what I'm saying. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8562.34s)]
*  While we're out here, we shoot. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8562.9s)]
*  What happened? [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8563.86s)]
*  Not it. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8564.98s)]
*  Wait, why? [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8565.7s)]
*  What's the deal? [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8566.26s)]
*  They got too much sheep in them? [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8567.14s)]
*  Look, there's some. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8570.82s)]
*  There's some really nice girls out there, but if you talk about per capita, [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8572.1s)]

*  So they're kind of awkward and uncomfortable, [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8760.9s)]
*  and then this older girl that knows how to make them comfy, [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPpsSL02l7o&t=8762.74s)]
