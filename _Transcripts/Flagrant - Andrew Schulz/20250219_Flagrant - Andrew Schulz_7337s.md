# Why Women Want Effort, “Girl Bosses” Ruined Dating, & Samay Raina & Ranveer Allahbadia Controversy
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU)
*  What's up everybody? Welcome to Flavor. I hope everybody had a wonderful Valentine's Day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=0.0s)]
*  I posted something on Instagram recently and women had quite the reaction to it. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  I posted this on Instagram not thinking it would get much. 12 million views later it turns out [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=10.4s)]
*  women aren't that happy with us. And by us I don't just mean Alex, Mark, Akash, and Andrew. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=16.32s)]
*  I mean just men in general. It seems like there's some frustration. Let's play the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=22.72s)]
*  clip so that everybody has some context. What do you think about effort? Why is the effort [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=26.0s)]
*  doesn't matter when I go to work? What is this? I want you to write a card. What are you talking [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=30.160000000000004s)]
*  about? Write a card. Explain to me the effort. If your girl orders food for you or cooks food for [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=33.92s)]
*  you, which one means more? I like it when she cooks but if she was like I'd rather just order [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=40.0s)]
*  and I'm totally cool with that. I just like the fact that she put... [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=44.32000000000001s)]
*  I think Akash had a thong. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  I don't like the fact that she put what? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=55.12s)]
*  The reaction from women about this clip was absolutely insane. We could have had a woman [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  on the podcast but that would go against our principles. I think it's just up to the boys [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=65.44s)]
*  to figure out what is going on. Are these women frustrated with us? It would appear so dude. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=70.96s)]
*  Those are just the lonely ones celebrating Galentine's Day. What is Galentine's Day? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=76.96s)]
*  The ones that they just hang out with their girls because they don't have actual batteries. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=82.16s)]
*  So you're saying that there was an emotional state that they really wish a guy would go put out some [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=85.36s)]
*  effort. I think there's also a lot of women who got shitty valentines. They're really driving this. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=89.28s)]
*  Tire One comment was like he's 41 years old mind you and I wanted to be like this is a long time [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=94.8s)]
*  ago. We were late 30s at that point. I still got a card I haven't written for my wife. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=100.56s)]
*  And not only was it valentine's it was her 30th birthday. I killed it. I gave her a great [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=107.12s)]
*  fucking weekend. It was awesome and that has nothing to do with the fact that I have [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=111.68s)]
*  an assistant now that I can outsource the effort to. That's what I would definitely suggest. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=117.44s)]
*  Your handwriting was so nice all of a sudden. Who are these flowers from? Tess and me? I was like me? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  Me? I just say me no matter what is in the house. I did that. I got that. Who shit on the floor? Me? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=127.44s)]
*  That was me. Definitely wasn't Kiana. We hope. Okay that's actually my suggestion first of all. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=132.96s)]
*  Get an assistant because all the thoughtful ideas that come to your head but you're like but then I [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=138.48s)]
*  gotta do it. You can outsource to them. Dude I saw you walking out of the studio one day. Your [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=141.92s)]
*  assistant was like hey here's a birthday gift for your friend and you're like really what is this? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=146.8s)]
*  And she was like they're the paddle shoes you mentioned and I was like oh that's why you get. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=150.4s)]
*  Dude stop snitching man. Jason. That came from me. That came from my heart. Who knows? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=154.32s)]
*  Yeah but there's only one guy who played paddle with them. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=160.48s)]
*  Don't care about effort. That touched his soul bro. When I showed him those shoes he was like [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=164.64s)]
*  shaking as he opened it because I thought he was going to be like vibrators and dildos inside or [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=168.95999999999998s)]
*  something like that but it was a real pair of paddle shoes. Anyway I think it's worth to have [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=173.6s)]
*  this discussion. It seems as if you know women feel like we're not putting in the effort that [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=178.24s)]
*  we should be putting in. Yeah I even saw a random TikTok recently after this conversation. We were [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=184.16s)]
*  talking about it and some girl was like I can't even go on a date with a guy if he's not going to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=190.32000000000002s)]
*  put in a reservation at a restaurant. Yes. She said that's a red flag. If you're not going to [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=194.24s)]
*  make a reservation we're not going on a date. So this is interesting. You brought this up yesterday [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  when we were discussing it. There are these things that have become very popular for women to talk [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=201.36s)]
*  about. Red flags, you said the ick. And all these things I think are really downstream from women [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=205.44s)]
*  wanting guys to put in effort. Now here's where it gets interesting and we do need to bring in the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=212.72s)]
*  girls for this so maybe grab them. But this is a kind of true thing. Women's greatest fear I believe [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=217.76s)]
*  is being alone. Men's greatest fear is being with a woman we don't want to be with. Yeah. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=225.6s)]
*  Okay well you couch the women one. What do you mean? I think they're also a little afraid of [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=232.88000000000002s)]
*  like getting murdered and stuff. No no I'm talking about like a relationship emotional kind of fear [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=237.12s)]
*  that kind of stuff. Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah. We're speaking on relationships. Great exaggeration. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=241.44s)]
*  And I still think alone trumps. Yeah that would rather be alone because when they're alone they [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=246.48000000000002s)]
*  dead end. Hey hey remember the hypothetical that women were like would you rather be alone with a [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=251.04000000000002s)]
*  bear or a man? That everybody chose bear. I bet if you said bear or alone they'd be like give me the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=256.24s)]
*  bearing is it? Okay guys so now we have there's a microphone right there with that I need you all [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=261.84s)]
*  to. We're turning to a Red Pill podcast. The second. We're kicking out of the studio in 30 seconds. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=268.15999999999997s)]
*  Imagine the second they started talking about this walk this thing file out of the box. I mean [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=273.03999999999996s)]
*  we got that on camera. We got that on camera. What is time to try? Somehow it turned into a hose. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=279.35999999999996s)]
*  She was like whoa I can't even. This is we try we try. Okay so yesterday at some point I think [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=282.96s)]
*  Mark was being very diplomatic but there is no room for diplomacy in this conversation. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=288.47999999999996s)]
*  At some point during our conversation yesterday during our production call you guys voiced this [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=292.23999999999995s)]
*  feeling that like a woman's greatest fear is being alone. You fear being alone more than being with [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=296.64s)]
*  a guy you don't like. Some women yes. Okay this is the thing. Tanya is a fucking guy. That's what I'm [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=303.52s)]
*  saying. All of our opinions are going to reflect exactly how we feel. Which I think why when we [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=309.12s)]
*  first met her we were like this is fucking awesome. But I think it also depends on age. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=312.88s)]
*  Point the mic towards you. We need to dub in here or something. Get dub in here so we can sit next [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=318.96s)]
*  to them and manage the women. We need the four women in here. I think it depends on first of all [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=324.0s)]
*  age and where you live. I think that's like a big thing. Okay. Like when I was like a 25 year old [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=332.15999999999997s)]
*  living in Montreal and everyone was coupled up. Yeah. Then it feels like oh it sucks to be alone [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=338.0s)]
*  because you no longer have fun things to do with your friends when everyone's coupled up and getting [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=343.36s)]
*  married and buying houses and shit. And you're just lonely and dying. Yeah and also everyone's like [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=348.24s)]
*  pressured. It's like societally like that is an age in Montreal where like you have to be settling [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=351.2s)]
*  down. Okay. If you're 25 in New York. Would you rather be with a guy you don't like or not? I don't [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=355.2s)]
*  want to ask this question to you. Yeah don't ask me that question. You don't mind. Yeah yeah yeah. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=359.52s)]
*  Because you don't even. Ask a real good question. Tanya doesn't even want to be with guys that she likes. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=361.52s)]
*  We were having a discussion yesterday and Tanya was like I'll be honest these guys are so fucking [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=367.04s)]
*  annoying they just want to spend time with me. Yeah yeah yeah. And Alex was talking about which [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=370.0s)]
*  I think is might be a common theme here that I didn't even realize. Female Alex. This is not [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=374.08s)]
*  male outs. We have a female one ex Alex here and and she brought this feeling about like girls [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=378.8s)]
*  would rather be with somebody than be by themselves. Yeah but I think it's also pretty. Point the mic [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=384.96s)]
*  up a little bit. Just toward you. Oh yeah sorry. The lady mic that needs to be shared. Dub's gonna get in here. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=390.24s)]
*  Yeah I think it's like subconscious that you don't realize that you hate him. You're just like oh yeah [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=394.88s)]
*  guys don't know how to plan dinner reservations. So you resent him so much and you don't even know [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=400.8s)]
*  why. Okay so this is we're gonna get to a good thing. This is good and it's gonna hurt a lot of [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=408.08s)]
*  our feelings because we're gonna start realizing that our significant other is haters. No that's what I'm here for. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=411.36s)]
*  This is an important thing. This is an important thing. Because I feel this all the time like does my wife hate me? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=414.96s)]
*  And it's like yeah. No but here's the thing but it's not my fault. They don't want to be alone so bad that [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=420.24s)]
*  they will be with guys that they don't like. Yeah. They don't even like us. They just hate being alone [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=426.32000000000005s)]
*  and now they resent us because they don't want to be alone. It's their fault. It's their fault. Yes! [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=433.12s)]
*  This is the eureka moment yesterday. No I feel. You're miserable because of you. We've been telling you this this whole time. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=438.16s)]
*  We're like we're good people. We're trying to make you happy. We let you read. I could figure out why Andrew was so excited about talking about it. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=446.88s)]
*  I finally get it. I get it now. I was truly like this guy's really excited. What's going on? I saw the light yesterday. I was like you could [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=453.44s)]
*  finally blame them. No no exactly right because this whole time that I was thinking my wife hates me and [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=462.08000000000004s)]
*  she's like I love you more than anything. No no she hates being alone. Yes toxic femininity. Yes now we're talking about it. Finally we have living here to be the faces. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=467.04s)]
*  Stupid. Here we go. Stupid and lazy. Okay so but here's the question. The messaging I feel like from [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=476.08s)]
*  like society and the the moms out there especially Jewish moms I think religion is a huge part of this. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=484.0s)]
*  Are you Jewish also? Yes. Yuck. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=489.28s)]
*  By the way we didn't know how we hired her until we went to work. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=494.72s)]
*  I'm just kidding. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=497.28s)]
*  I was going to tell you. I didn't want to watch somebody's face. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=501.84s)]
*  We need to get done with it real quick. So yeah Tanya Alex and Kiana okay. Yeah. Kiana is my assistant and she was here like two days right and we were staying [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=509.03999999999996s)]
*  super late. We're working on something and she started bringing up this idea of like she's like yeah but you're spending all this money on ubers and [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=520.0s)]
*  there's a certain situation where you could potentially get a car and you could you know have a driver for the car and that driver would be available to you whenever you want but actually less than all these ubers. You should run that numbers and we're talking and then and Dove just like stops and he gazes at her. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=526.32s)]
*  Right and Kiana is Chinese and Belizean right and he gazes at her he goes are you Jewish? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=540.4000000000001s)]
*  He's like stop it. He would say this is the greatest compliment he could bestow on anybody. Anyway okay so Jewish moms really want you to get married. They really want you to get married. Because they want you to be miserable like them. Yeah exactly and they want to pass it down. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=556.4000000000001s)]
*  Like women didn't just invent this of like oh I don't need to be alone. It's the messaging of like oh well all men are terrible. No man knows how to make a dinner reservation or write you a note or send you a playlist that you know they had thought of. So it's just like okay well then you might as well just pick one. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=568.4000000000001s)]
*  You're gonna hate them anyway. So the expectation is that we all suck right? You're gonna hate us anyway. That's valid for us. Yeah but when we live up to that expectation you guys are still upset about it. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=584.48s)]
*  I sometimes. I just want to point that thing about the playlist which is very true. We don't do that. But today I just want to point this out. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=596.48s)]
*  We don't make playlists that you would like. But today Mark had a playlist ready on the computer. White songs that black people like just for Alex. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=604.5600000000001s)]
*  We're very thoughtful for one another. Whatever you made today was phenomenal. Come on bro. My interracial effort is my big thing okay. Not intergender I don't believe in that. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=614.5600000000001s)]
*  That was a great display of romance. Right? Yeah. I had no fucking clue that a playlist was thoughtful. Y'all like playlists? And I think I do a lot of thoughtful things. Women and you lost my mind. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=625.5600000000001s)]
*  Anything that seems like you're paying attention. Yes. But there's a thing. We just pay. And that's your guys fault. We want you to pay. Exactly. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=633.64s)]
*  Well then if you pick one. If paying didn't matter. I really believe if paying didn't matter to you guys at all. Then we would have to go the extra mile to elicit that same reaction. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=644.64s)]
*  But unfortunately paying for things works. Hold on. The paying is like a generosity thing. And I think biologically we haven't evolved over time. We still want to make sure. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=656.72s)]
*  Yo Tanya is spitting. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=666.8000000000001s)]
*  We still want you to pay for shit because we want to know you're generous. And when you expect us to have kids. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=670.8000000000001s)]
*  She's holding the mic like a rapper. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=675.8000000000001s)]
*  We can't work anymore. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=677.8000000000001s)]
*  Okay good point. Think about it like this. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=679.8000000000001s)]
*  Eventually your guys are going to want us to have kids. Right? Eventually you're going to want us to have kids. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=684.8000000000001s)]
*  This is why women got the right to vote. Because there was one Tanya woman out there that was like spitting to all the politicians. I think that they could do it. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=690.88s)]
*  I've been thinking about women like Akash's wife who are constantly on TikTok. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=697.88s)]
*  Oh this is another thing. If we make Akash's wife. We were talking about this. This is my goal now in life. I didn't know that Akash's wife was like a serious influencer. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=703.88s)]
*  She's like a big fucking deal. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=710.88s)]
*  I watch hours of her TikTok. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=712.88s)]
*  So here's the thing. I didn't know this. Now that I know that she is like an influencer on TikTok. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=714.96s)]
*  You know what hurt my feelings? I've literally sent a video. Remember she made it on Fox News. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=720.96s)]
*  You didn't pay attention. You paid no attention and that hurt my feelings. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=724.96s)]
*  That really hurt me. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=728.96s)]
*  Isn't that thoughtless? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=730.96s)]
*  You know what hurt me? When you send me a video of your wife. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=732.96s)]
*  That's what hurt me. When you know that I have other shit to do and you're like watch my wife talk about this shit. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=738.96s)]
*  That was the insulting thing. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=744.0400000000001s)]
*  I hate you. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=746.0400000000001s)]
*  I hate you. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=748.0400000000001s)]

*  Really? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1067.6799999999998s)]
*  That's not fun to look forward to at all. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1068.6799999999998s)]
*  No, but I had to create a game to show effort. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1071.6799999999998s)]
*  Me and my fiance do Christmas every month. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1075.6799999999998s)]
*  So on the 25th of every month, we give each other a gift. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1078.6799999999998s)]
*  So we have to listen to one another throughout the month [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1081.6799999999998s)]
*  and see if you pick up on something that that person needs. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1084.6799999999998s)]
*  That is a lot, dude. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1086.6799999999998s)]
*  You gotta gamify it. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1087.76s)]
*  Listen. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1088.76s)]
*  What he's done is brilliantly framed. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1089.76s)]
*  You framed... [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1092.76s)]
*  Now you're gonna make this shit up. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1093.76s)]
*  I'm not gonna shit on it. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1095.76s)]
*  I'm not gonna shit on it. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1096.76s)]
*  But what he's gonna shit on... [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1097.76s)]
*  He's gonna shit on it. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1098.76s)]
*  But this is genius. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1099.76s)]
*  This is why you're really smart. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1100.76s)]
*  Because you framed as this exciting thing for her. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1101.76s)]
*  And now she gets the effort that you want. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1103.76s)]
*  But what you really did is create a device [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1106.76s)]
*  where anytime she wants to buy anything, you go, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1108.76s)]
*  but it's not the 25th of the month yet. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1111.76s)]
*  So why would you get that? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1114.76s)]
*  No, because he can still buy it, but he gotta listen. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1115.84s)]
*  It's still his responsibility to get a gift [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1118.84s)]
*  that she didn't buy herself. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1120.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1121.84s)]
*  So he gotta actually listen. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1122.84s)]
*  Buddy, you've dug yourself into a fucking hole. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1123.84s)]
*  It's already too many days to give a fuck. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1125.84s)]
*  Valentine's, birthdays, Christmas, India, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1128.84s)]
*  I got Diwali, I got a fucking... [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1131.84s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1133.84s)]
*  A funeral here and there. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1134.84s)]
*  We got it back into the mix. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1135.84s)]
*  But some of us like hearing from our partners. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1136.84s)]
*  It's not a hard thing. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1139.84s)]
*  Is that your low language quality time? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1140.84s)]
*  Because that shit, I did the test, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1142.84s)]
*  that's my least important. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1143.84s)]
*  With any human being. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1144.9199999999998s)]
*  Y'all get the fuck out of my face, tell me you love me. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1145.9199999999998s)]
*  Time is much. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1147.9199999999998s)]
*  Let's hug. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1148.9199999999998s)]
*  That's a lie, bro. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1149.9199999999998s)]
*  We used to spend so much time together. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1150.9199999999998s)]
*  No, no. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1151.9199999999998s)]
*  We lived together. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1152.9199999999998s)]
*  We'd go out to eat until 3 in the morning every single night. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1153.9199999999998s)]
*  You love quality time. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1155.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I was lonely. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1156.9199999999998s)]
*  I'd rather be with you. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1157.9199999999998s)]
*  There you go. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1164.9199999999998s)]
*  Oh, that is funny. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1165.9199999999998s)]
*  You didn't actually like hanging out. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1166.9199999999998s)]
*  You just didn't want to be alone. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1167.9199999999998s)]
*  You didn't want to be alone, dude. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1168.9199999999998s)]
*  You know what? [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1169.9199999999998s)]
*  The TikToks of my life, this guy's thoughtless. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1170.9199999999998s)]
*  You just didn't want to be alone. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1172.9199999999998s)]
*  I didn't know they were that funny, man. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1174.0s)]
*  I'll be honest. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1175.0s)]
*  I will subscribe. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1177.0s)]
*  I just got TikTok back on my phone. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1178.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1179.0s)]
*  Because I had a new phone. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1180.0s)]
*  You didn't get TikTok until like two days ago. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1181.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1182.0s)]
*  So now I'm locked in. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1183.0s)]
*  Oh, can I ask you a question about the rather be with somebody even if they suck? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1185.0s)]
*  Do you think it's rooted in biology and the biological clock? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1190.0s)]
*  No. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1193.0s)]
*  Yes and no. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1194.0s)]
*  Well, hold on. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1195.0s)]
*  I think yes, because it depends on how old you are. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1196.0s)]
*  Well, let's let Tawny answer because her clock is old. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1197.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1199.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1200.0s)]
*  I feel like that's the one. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1201.0s)]
*  I don't know if you guys know. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1202.0s)]
*  I was just looking like Beauty and the Beast. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1203.08s)]
*  It's like... [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1204.08s)]
*  You know what I joke? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1210.08s)]
*  Two of my best male friends have been coercing me to go get my eggs frozen. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1211.08s)]
*  My male friends. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1216.08s)]
*  Yeah, you should. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1217.08s)]
*  But this is a hustle too. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1218.08s)]
*  We were talking about this. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1219.08s)]
*  Yeah, but also I think it is rooted in that. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1220.08s)]
*  But I also think it's like if you're in your 30s, or mid 30s especially, and you've been [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1222.08s)]
*  with the guy for like a year, and you're like, fuck, I only have a couple more years left. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1227.08s)]
*  Right? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1232.1599999999999s)]
*  So then it's true. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1233.1599999999999s)]
*  It is rooted in that. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1234.1599999999999s)]
*  And then there's also intertwined like all the other attachment stuff. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1235.1599999999999s)]
*  What's our maternity leave policy? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1237.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think you got one. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1239.1599999999999s)]
*  You know, it's funny is freezing your eggs is probably cheaper than maternity leave. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1241.6399999999999s)]
*  And I wonder if that's why the business is doing it. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1246.36s)]
*  They do do it that way. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1248.36s)]
*  100%. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1249.36s)]
*  So in an... [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1250.36s)]
*  Oh God, that's the worst... [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1251.36s)]
*  That's 100% why the tech companies all do that. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1252.36s)]
*  That's the worst type of sexism when it's framed as... [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1254.6799999999998s)]
*  Progressive. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1257.56s)]
*  Progressive. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1258.56s)]
*  It's the same as PTO, by the way. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1259.56s)]
*  Why do you think companies get... [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1260.56s)]
*  I don't know what that is. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1262.04s)]
*  Don't even explain it. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1263.04s)]
*  I don't want to know if there's something we should be giving. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1264.04s)]
*  What is PTO? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1265.04s)]
*  Pay time off. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1266.04s)]
*  I don't even understand that intellectually. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1267.04s)]
*  It's got time off in the fucking acronym or whatever that is. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1268.04s)]
*  Basically, tech companies give unlimited PTO. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1273.04s)]
*  So how do you have a business? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1276.04s)]
*  Because the whole point is when you give someone... [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1279.04s)]
*  Speak into the mic for fuck's sake. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1282.04s)]
*  When you give someone two weeks, and then they don't take it, you have to pay them out for [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1284.04s)]
*  it. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1289.04s)]
*  It's unlimited, and most people in tech companies, they won't even take their PTO. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1290.52s)]
*  Love that. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1294.52s)]
*  They feel shame. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1295.52s)]
*  They feel judgment. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1296.52s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1297.52s)]
*  It's like, especially in America, it's like you're always working, you're always working, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1298.52s)]
*  even if you're traveling, you're answering emails. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1299.52s)]
*  But then the companies don't have to pay them out. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1301.52s)]
*  So it's like they do it for a tax purpose. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1304.08s)]
*  Oh, you're saying if they don't take the two weeks off, they have to pay them for the time [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1306.1599999999999s)]
*  they work. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1309.6s)]
*  So they do unlimited pay time off. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1310.6s)]
*  They only take three days. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1311.6s)]
*  So it's the same thing with the freezing your eyes bullshit. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1312.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1316.6s)]
*  We will ship in a freezer eggs though, right? [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1317.6s)]
*  Yeah, actually. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1320.1599999999999s)]
*  Would you? [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1321.1599999999999s)]

*  A jar in the office? [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1324.1599999999999s)]
*  No, no, I would freeze it. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1325.1599999999999s)]
*  I could work out a freezing situation. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1326.1599999999999s)]
*  No, no, absolutely. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1327.1599999999999s)]
*  I will definitely pay anybody here that wants to freeze their eyes. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1328.1599999999999s)]
*  We got witnesses everybody. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1331.1599999999999s)]
*  I hope Zach you're listening. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1332.1599999999999s)]

*  Well, no, Zach is gainfully employed. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1334.1599999999999s)]
*  But you just offered. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1335.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, fuck. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1336.1599999999999s)]
*  Anyway, okay. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1337.1599999999999s)]
*  Is there a plan B fund? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1338.1599999999999s)]
*  Should we put them in the studio though? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1339.1599999999999s)]
*  Is that allowed? [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1340.1599999999999s)]
*  Oh, can we store them? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1341.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1342.1599999999999s)]
*  Can we be the one to store them? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1343.1599999999999s)]
*  When it's frozen eggs like an agro-cragg, just like in the corner. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1344.1599999999999s)]
*  Before we forget, you had a great point on the call yesterday. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1347.72s)]
*  This is why Taylor Swift women fucking love. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1349.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1352.64s)]
*  Because she seemingly doesn't put up with the shitty guy. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1353.64s)]
*  She'll break up with you. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1356.76s)]
*  She'll write a song, make all the money, but speak to you guys in your frustrations. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1357.96s)]
*  Because she's more comfortable being lonely, I guess, or the perception is she is. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1362.3200000000002s)]
*  Because she is financially independent. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1367.48s)]
*  There is an incentive to date the guy who can, yeah, maybe he's not the most thoughtful, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1369.4s)]
*  but he can pay for a meal because maybe I can get out of this girl boss rat race. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1373.36s)]
*  Like that would be great. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1377.6399999999999s)]
*  And Taylor can leave the guy. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1378.7199999999998s)]
*  What's the girl boss rat race? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1380.1999999999998s)]
*  Because I feel like girls are leaving this shit. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1381.6399999999999s)]
*  Like the girl boss thing was hot five years ago and I feel like that thing is dying. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1383.8799999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah, it was kind of a lie that was sold to us. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1388.24s)]
*  We're getting a shift in social media. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1390.76s)]
*  It's like the whole trad wife. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1392.4599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, trad wife. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1393.9599999999998s)]
*  Like super like into like raising your children, cooking for them. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1394.9599999999998s)]
*  God forbid. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1398.28s)]
*  Homestead. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1399.28s)]
*  Chicken. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1400.28s)]
*  Brawn milk. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1401.28s)]
*  Everything from scratch. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1402.28s)]
*  Why do you guys think that is? [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1404.2s)]
*  Trump. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1405.8s)]
*  Oh boy. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1406.8s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1407.8s)]
*  Yallah blaming your own shift in mindset on Trump? [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1411.24s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1414.12s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1415.12s)]
*  I think it was a, it was a lie because it was like, Oh, like, you're, you know, we have [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1416.12s)]
*  more of these, but it's really fun that they are all sharing. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1420.44s)]
*  We don't have to share. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1422.6s)]
*  It's like we were told that you could like girl boss and not have to like, you know, be [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1425.04s)]
*  the madman wife at home. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1431.84s)]
*  But all of a sudden now we have to do both. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1433.6s)]
*  No one's planning your dinner reservations or taking care of you. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1435.32s)]
*  So this is interesting. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1438.36s)]
*  Also girls don't date down. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1439.36s)]
*  Well, I want to get to that in a second. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1440.36s)]
*  But but this is interesting about the girl boss idea. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1443.1599999999999s)]
*  So maybe there's a little part of them. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1446.1799999999998s)]
*  They're going, okay, if I go to work, I make that money. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1447.36s)]
*  Yeah, you don't have to be with the loser. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1449.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1452.24s)]
*  Well, no, you don't have to be the loser for sure. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1453.24s)]
*  But then you assume that the guy would also pick up some of the slack. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1454.24s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1459.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1461.0800000000002s)]
*  And then you found out that we won't. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1462.0800000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1463.0800000000002s)]
*  And now you're like, why am I working? [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1464.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, like I'll do all the thoughtful shit. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1465.48s)]
*  I don't I don't need you. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1467.5600000000002s)]
*  But you're not going to work as well. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1468.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I don't want to work as well. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1470.2s)]
*  Give me home or give me office. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1472.52s)]
*  I don't want to do both. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1474.44s)]
*  And I think now people are having to do both. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1475.68s)]
*  When you decide this, like a million years ago, to that point, biologically, we haven't [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1477.96s)]
*  changed. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1486.1200000000001s)]
*  Would you rather work? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1487.4399999999998s)]
*  You got a guy maybe makes up maybe less, maybe a lot less money than you, but does all the [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1489.6799999999998s)]
*  thoughtful shit or you do the thoughtful shit and they work? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1493.08s)]
*  Which would you rather? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1495.9599999999998s)]
*  They do the thoughtful shit and they were. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1496.9599999999998s)]
*  I mean, I'm. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1498.9599999999998s)]
*  That's the truth. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1499.9599999999998s)]
*  It depends how good their job is, honestly. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1500.9599999999998s)]
*  Like, I think if they're like really high up, then like, great, I'll do that. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1501.9599999999998s)]
*  But yeah, I think most people probably want to like be in love and have someone do the [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1506.96s)]
*  thoughtful stuff. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1511.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1512.1200000000001s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1513.1200000000001s)]
*  So if the guy has like a really important job where it's very time consuming, you'll [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1514.1200000000001s)]
*  do all that kind of stuff. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1517.88s)]
*  Yeah, I'll do all the home stuff. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1518.88s)]
*  If you're just going to let you know right now, things paid for. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1519.88s)]
*  You're saying that until you guys get comfortable and then you're going to be like, oh, I'm [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1522.4s)]
*  going to do this. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1528.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm going to do this. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1529.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm going to do this. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1530.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm going to do this. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1531.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm going to do this. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1532.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm going to do this. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1533.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm going to do this. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1534.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm going to do this. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1535.3600000000001s)]
*  And then that shit goes out the fucking way. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1536.4799999999998s)]
*  I'll tell you right now, I don't want that. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1538.4799999999998s)]
*  No, we know. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1539.4799999999998s)]
*  Why don't we even call Tanya? [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1540.4799999999998s)]
*  Tanya, you should be sitting on this. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1544.4799999999998s)]
*  Seriously call Tanya or like Tanya and you'll get better answers. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1546.4799999999998s)]
*  No, I think that everybody, you start to get comfortable and... [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1552.4799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, but the money comes with control also, which is a part that I don't like. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1557.4799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that is bad. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1560.4799999999998s)]
*  If they have... [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1561.4799999999998s)]
*  How do we have control? [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1562.4799999999998s)]
*  Oh, what an illusion. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1563.4799999999998s)]
*  Paying for everything, paying for the house. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1564.6s)]
*  We're married. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1566.6s)]
*  There's no prenup. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1567.6s)]
*  Yeah, until you start cheating and then there's a divorce and then the woman's stuck with [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1568.6s)]
*  nothing. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1572.6s)]
*  Nothing? [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1573.6s)]
*  They have to rely... [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1574.6s)]
*  Well, that's how you sign a prenup. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1575.6s)]
*  I didn't have a prenup. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1576.6s)]
*  Not you specifically. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1577.6s)]
*  I'm talking about the world. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1578.6s)]
*  You're saying what I should have done. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1579.6s)]
*  You should have. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1580.6s)]
*  Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1581.6s)]
*  And then, cause I mean, this was my biggest resentment in Montreal. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1582.6s)]
*  Girls, my generation. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1586.6s)]
*  You know, Tanya gave it all her shit. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1587.6s)]
*  We saw. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1588.6s)]
*  I know. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1589.6s)]
*  She needed this. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1590.6s)]
*  She needed this. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1591.6s)]
*  This is therapy. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1592.6s)]
*  It's like our mothers all went through the same thing. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1593.7199999999998s)]
*  They didn't work. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1596.3999999999999s)]
*  The second they started a family, they didn't work. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1597.3999999999999s)]
*  The husband's made all the money. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1600.32s)]
*  The husbands are going off on business trips. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1601.32s)]
*  They're fucking around. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1603.04s)]
*  They're cheating. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1604.04s)]
*  Women want to get divorced. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1605.04s)]
*  And then the women are stuck with nothing. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1606.04s)]
*  And they still, even after divorced, have to rely on the husband to provide whatever [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1607.7199999999998s)]
*  they choose as alimony. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1612.1599999999999s)]
*  Right? [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1613.8s)]
*  And to be fair, I've heard this saying that makes a lot of sense. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1614.8s)]
*  The courts are not in the collections business. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1617.6399999999999s)]
*  So even if they award you half, the husband could just not pay. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1619.48s)]
*  There's not really much you can do. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1622.4399999999998s)]
*  Which I think is fair to bring up. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1624.28s)]
*  There's no like the courts not going to come after you. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1625.64s)]
*  Not really. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1627.72s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1628.72s)]
*  No, they do a little bit. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1629.72s)]
*  If you have a child, and that's why you want to have a kid. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1630.72s)]
*  But there's a difference between you and a kid. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1633.72s)]
*  Don't hand Moshow in. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1636.72s)]
*  That's how you got to have a kid. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1638.72s)]
*  Apparently. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1641.72s)]
*  She's Jewish. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1642.72s)]
*  So if you trap him, if you baby trap him, you gotta go. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1643.72s)]
*  You gotta let women talk. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1650.72s)]
*  Stop silencing them. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1659.0s)]
*  Is I'm the only one of color on this side? [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1660.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1663.0s)]
*  Now this side. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1664.0s)]
*  Okay, go. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1665.0s)]
*  Well, Tanya is something. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1666.0s)]
*  Tanya is from Africa. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1667.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1670.0s)]
*  She's part African. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1671.0s)]
*  Like kids who have divorced parents, like my best friend, her mom got alimony and got [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1674.28s)]
*  child support. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1681.04s)]
*  The courts will go after the dad if they don't pay. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1682.04s)]
*  If you have a child and they'll take away your passport so you can't travel. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1685.2s)]
*  What do you guys think of alimony as a concept? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1688.08s)]
*  Fantastic. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1691.08s)]
*  I don't love it. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1692.08s)]
*  I don't mind you get half. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1693.08s)]
*  I do. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1694.08s)]
*  Wait, listen to this argument again. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1695.08s)]
*  Half, half, sure. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1696.08s)]
*  But alimony? [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1697.08s)]
*  It depends who falls for divorce. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1698.08s)]
*  Isn't that what alimony is supposed to be? [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1699.08s)]
*  Half is what we got now. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1700.1599999999999s)]
*  One at a time, one at a time. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1701.1599999999999s)]
*  You take half of what we got now in a divorce, especially we got kids. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1704.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1707.1599999999999s)]
*  Child support, even if we got kids. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1708.1599999999999s)]
*  Okay, alimony. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1709.1599999999999s)]
*  Of course, you need to do that. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1710.1599999999999s)]
*  That's your fault. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1711.1599999999999s)]
*  No, but hold on. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1712.1599999999999s)]
*  Andrew, wait, this is a good question for Andrew. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1713.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1714.1599999999999s)]
*  Okay, so you're successful. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1715.1599999999999s)]
*  It's a dangerous question for Andrew, but I think you mentioned it. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1716.1599999999999s)]
*  You're successful when you met Emma. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1719.1599999999999s)]
*  You made X amount. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1720.1599999999999s)]
*  Yep. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1721.1599999999999s)]
*  And you're successful when you met Emma. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1722.1599999999999s)]
*  You made X amount. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1723.1599999999999s)]
*  You made X amount. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1724.1599999999999s)]
*  You made X amount. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1725.1599999999999s)]
*  You made X amount. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1726.1599999999999s)]
*  When you met Emma, you made X amount. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1727.24s)]
*  Yep. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1729.76s)]
*  Right? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1730.76s)]
*  And now you're significantly more successful than then. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1731.76s)]
*  Yep. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1732.76s)]
*  And you have a baby, and you prefer that she stays at home with the baby because that's [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1733.76s)]
*  how you want your child. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1738.88s)]
*  That's an assumption. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1739.88s)]
*  No, that's what I'm saying, assuming that that's what happens. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1740.88s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1742.76s)]
*  It's not true? [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1743.76s)]
*  No. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1744.76s)]
*  Because a lot of fathers actually prefer that the mother raises the kid versus- [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1745.76s)]
*  So it was very, I was very specific about this. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1749.28s)]
*  Like Emma, she got her MBA. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1752.48s)]
*  She was doing AI projects for Apple. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1754.44s)]
*  She was killing it. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1757.48s)]
*  And this was her choice. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1758.96s)]
*  So I said, you have to want to do this. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1759.96s)]
*  Okay, fine. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1762.24s)]
*  Like this is, it's not going to be my decision because if you don't like it, I don't want [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1763.24s)]
*  you to ever resent me for it. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1766.6s)]
*  So this has to be your decision. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1768.64s)]
*  If anytime you want to go back to work, obviously, I grew up in a family where both parents work. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1770.24s)]
*  Now, was I supportive of it? [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1774.08s)]
*  A thousand percent. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1777.6s)]
*  Like the person I trust more than anything in the world is going to be the one looking [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1778.6s)]
*  after my daughter. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1780.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's the ideal scenario of the world. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1782.16s)]
*  But I'm not going to like restrict her. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1784.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1785.76s)]
*  But hypothetically, there are- [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1786.76s)]
*  If there are guys that go, you can't work. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1787.76s)]
*  I need to get the baby. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1789.24s)]
*  Sometimes they prefer it for family purposes. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1790.8400000000001s)]
*  Sometimes if you like actually do the math, it almost becomes more expensive to hire nannies [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1794.3200000000002s)]
*  and everything than the mother's salary at that moment in time. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1799.16s)]
*  So she quits her job. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1803.26s)]
*  She stays at home. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1804.26s)]
*  And then let's say when she does, if she decides to go back to work, eventually after you've [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1805.44s)]
*  had three kids, whatever, she's now 10 years behind in her career versus where she would [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1809.4s)]
*  have been. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1814.3600000000001s)]
*  So then that's where the growth of when you got married versus where you are now comes [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1815.3600000000001s)]
*  into play, which is not fair to just get, let's say half of like when you started. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1820.16s)]
*  So this is the way I look at these things. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1824.4s)]
*  I think it's like a great like more nuanced point. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1826.4s)]
*  I think that there's a certain number where we don't need to worry about alimony. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1828.96s)]
*  So let's say, for example, like you got you have $20 million between the two of you, you [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1833.0s)]
*  guys get divorced 10 and 10. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1837.8s)]
*  You'll figure it the fuck out. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1841.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1842.28s)]
*  You don't need alimony as well. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1843.28s)]
*  But that's not how the law looks at it. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1845.68s)]
*  The law looks at you split 50 50 and you have to maintain her lifestyle. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1847.6s)]
*  Whatever her lifestyle was with you, you have to maintain it. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1851.54s)]
*  That's where we, it's not her fault. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1854.24s)]
*  It's not her fault. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1857.24s)]
*  It's not her fault. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1858.24s)]
*  It's the law's fault. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1859.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1860.24s)]
*  And these laws are kind of antiquated because they're built around a time where women weren't, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1861.24s)]
*  you know, girl bosses, they weren't making all this money and they wanted to protect [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1863.48s)]
*  women because they literally couldn't get a job to support a family. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1866.24s)]
*  So most people don't have 20 million. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1868.2s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1870.2s)]
*  So I'm just saying there needs to be like a little bit more nuance with it. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1871.2s)]
*  Usually the way the judge looks at it, I'm pretty sure is to maintain the same, to maintain [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1874.32s)]
*  the same lifestyle as when you were married. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1880.1599999999999s)]
*  So it's like if you were buying your wife a Chanel every year, you should stay married. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1883.28s)]
*  You should have bought her Chanel every year in the first place. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1886.6s)]
*  No, no, like you should have. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1888.6399999999999s)]
*  But it's lifestyle with us being married. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1890.28s)]
*  Like for example, I got to maintain your lifestyle with us being married, but you don't got to [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1891.92s)]
*  come and cook me dinner every night. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1895.64s)]
*  That's mild. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1897.56s)]
*  That's the Chris Rajo pussy payments. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1898.56s)]
*  No, I don't want pussy. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1899.56s)]
*  I want dinner. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1901.44s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1902.44s)]
*  Like I want, I want the clothes washed and folded. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1904.68s)]
*  Like if I have to pay you to maintain your lifestyle, you should still do the things [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1908.48s)]
*  that maintain my lifestyle. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1912.32s)]
*  I agree with that. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1913.32s)]
*  You made a choice or we made a choice when we got divorced, this lifestyle is fundamentally [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1914.32s)]
*  different because of just wanting you. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1918.48s)]
*  And I think if women understood where some of this like red pill movement is rooted in [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1919.84s)]
*  this, like this idea is crazy. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1924.6399999999999s)]
*  Let's say Andrew's 20 million and most guys who are complaining about this won't make [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1927.08s)]
*  that kind of money. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1930.28s)]
*  But 20 million, whatever job losses you have valid, they may be is more than offset by [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1931.28s)]
*  the 10 million you just got. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1936.12s)]
*  Oh, that I 100% agree with. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1937.12s)]
*  You can't make that work that's on you. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1938.12s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's essentially the point. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1939.12s)]
*  But I agree with you that in circumstances where people are both, you know, like one [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1941.76s)]
*  person is a teacher, for example, and the other person is staying home with the kids. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1945.24s)]
*  Like obviously you can't let that person go back to his career that they haven't done [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1948.12s)]
*  10 years. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1951.9599999999998s)]
*  And then you're making money and now the kids are going to also suffer. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1953.0s)]
*  So I get that point as well. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1954.88s)]
*  There just needs to be a little bit more nuance. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1956.52s)]
*  And I think they just put like, what is it, the fucking Bill of Rights down and precedent [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1958.04s)]
*  was set and now we can't break from precedent. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1963.4s)]
*  All of this nuance, wouldn't it be easier? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1965.28s)]
*  Like isn't there some motivation for like Andrew in that clip or everyone in the comments, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1967.6000000000001s)]
*  like men trying to like process this effort thing? [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1972.92s)]
*  Like wouldn't it be easier to just learn how to send a playlist or make a reservation? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1975.16s)]
*  You can avoid all of this. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1980.2s)]
*  It's so easy. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1981.2s)]
*  They're begging. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1982.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm going to be honest with you. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1983.3600000000001s)]
*  And I spoke about this, I think, on the pod, right? [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1984.3600000000001s)]
*  There was like, it was like my wife's birthday. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1986.24s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1988.24s)]
*  It was Christmas or something like that. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1989.24s)]
*  One day I got her for Christmas. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1990.24s)]
*  These like crocs that had these like little gibets in them that like pertained to her [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1991.24s)]
*  life and like our daughter and everything like that. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1995.24s)]
*  And she cared about that way more than anything expensive that I got her. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=1997.48s)]
*  And despite that clip coming out six years ago, it hit me. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2001.8s)]
*  I was like, oh, maybe I should like look into what she likes or whatever and like get things [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2004.64s)]
*  around that. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2010.28s)]
*  And now that makes sense. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2011.36s)]
*  But I think Akash, you pointed this out. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2014.68s)]
*  It's easier. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2016.08s)]
*  It's less work. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2017.08s)]
*  It's like we're being lazy when we buy the expensive gift. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2018.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2020.32s)]
*  But you're basically paying for their lack of thoughtfulness. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2021.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2023.6s)]
*  And but even this time around, same thing happened. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2024.6s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2027.32s)]
*  The effort is there. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2028.32s)]
*  My concern is and I think like when a girl really does love somebody, you know, hopefully [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2029.32s)]
*  my wife really loves me, it makes that much more of a difference. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2033.52s)]
*  But I do feel like there are some relationships where girls are in where they're like they [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2036.44s)]
*  don't really like the guy. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2040.56s)]
*  They just don't want to be alone. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2042.6s)]
*  And they these thoughtful things that the guys are doing are just like, how do I say [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2045.04s)]
*  that? [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2050.36s)]
*  They just like extend the unhappiness a little bit longer. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2051.36s)]
*  You break up with that guy. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2054.88s)]
*  You don't have an ick. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2056.92s)]
*  You don't have a red flag. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2057.92s)]
*  You don't like him. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2058.92s)]
*  I totally agree. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2059.92s)]
*  I think that's where you get to the point where she she's been presenting this lack [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2060.92s)]
*  of effort thing. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2064.34s)]
*  She's been begging for the effort. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2065.34s)]
*  It's not clicking. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2066.48s)]
*  And then even if he does do it, it's like, OK, then she gets to a point where every word [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2067.72s)]
*  that comes out of her mouth is nagging. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2071.68s)]
*  It's going to be just like miserable for both of you. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2073.7999999999997s)]
*  And it's like, oh, yeah, just just break. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2077.3599999999997s)]
*  But that feeling of fear of being alone is like why? [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2080.6s)]
*  But one second, one second. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2084.7599999999998s)]
*  This is a thing that's interesting. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2086.74s)]
*  We're so used to the nagging. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2089.9199999999996s)]
*  We think that's what you guys are. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2092.8999999999996s)]
*  And that's the problem. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2095.48s)]
*  But think about that. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2097.6800000000003s)]
*  Now, I'm not talking about our wives. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2098.6800000000003s)]
*  Definitely not. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2100.6800000000003s)]
*  No, past relationships. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2101.6800000000003s)]
*  But like you look at every TV show. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2102.6800000000003s)]
*  No, no, you look at every TV show, right? [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2105.6800000000003s)]
*  It's like Al Bundy and his nagging wife. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2108.0s)]
*  It's like the nagging wife in every single one. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2109.48s)]
*  But what you're saying is that this is like a downriver problem from picking this guy [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2111.56s)]
*  because you don't want to be alone. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2116.76s)]
*  I'm just putting the blame on you, which is unfair. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2117.88s)]
*  But you understand what I'm trying to say. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2120.28s)]
*  In my experience, when a girl really likes a guy, nothing bothers her about that guy [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2122.52s)]
*  at all. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2127.2799999999997s)]
*  We're in 100% agreement. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2128.2799999999997s)]
*  It's not that like women nag or that like, oh, I'm being a bitch. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2129.2799999999997s)]
*  It's just like, oh, you two shouldn't be together. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2133.44s)]
*  Yeah, there's high rating, low standards across the board that like, oh, she nags, duh. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2135.64s)]
*  And she's like, oh, yeah, well, he doesn't put in any effort, duh. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2139.68s)]
*  And they're both just accepting mediocrity. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2142.16s)]
*  Just take a year to be alone. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2144.2799999999997s)]
*  Someone better might pop up. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2146.72s)]
*  Someone might not. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2147.88s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2148.88s)]
*  You're fine. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2149.88s)]
*  That shit's still going to happen though. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2150.88s)]
*  I'm going to still be thoughtless sometimes. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2152.6400000000003s)]
*  You know, I mean, the ex-pick, there is a- [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2153.6400000000003s)]
*  But you love each other and that's fine. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2154.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2155.6400000000003s)]
*  But you know what is annoying? [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2156.6400000000003s)]
*  When you put some thought in and they still nag. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2157.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2159.88s)]
*  That shit makes you- [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2161.88s)]
*  There needs to be a one week shut the fuck up. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2162.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2164.88s)]
*  One week shut the fuck up. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2165.88s)]
*  Does that apply to what men are bitching? [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2167.88s)]
*  And this is what I'm going to get in trouble for saying. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2170.88s)]
*  There is a rate of inflation on thoughtfulness. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2173.88s)]
*  Get a TikTok ready. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2175.88s)]
*  Get a TikTok ready. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2176.88s)]
*  There is a rate of inflation on thoughtfulness. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2177.88s)]
*  The amount of effort that is thoughtful, you get used to it as anybody would get used [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2180.88s)]
*  to anything. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2185.88s)]
*  But that amount of effort increases. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2186.88s)]
*  So, sometimes it's like, all right, well, let me just pay the money because that will- [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2187.88s)]
*  Now, thoughtful went from here to here. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2191.88s)]
*  I disagree. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2193.88s)]
*  I don't think thoughtful- [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2194.88s)]
*  That's because nobody's been thoughtful for you. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2195.88s)]
*  Damn. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2196.88s)]
*  You just started working here. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2197.88s)]
*  Damn. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2198.88s)]
*  I disagree. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2199.88s)]
*  But I think it was because I know it's because I've been- [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2200.88s)]
*  God damn. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2202.88s)]
*  Akash. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2203.88s)]
*  Go, can you tell us your feelings with respect to having an HR department? [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2204.88s)]
*  Where's Doug? [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2207.88s)]
*  Where's Doug? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2208.88s)]
*  Where's Doug? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2209.88s)]
*  Where's Doug? [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2210.88s)]
*  I think, yeah, you can scale it up. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2211.88s)]
*  You can do something more thoughtful. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2212.88s)]
*  You can plan something more thoughtful. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2213.88s)]
*  But it doesn't always go up. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2214.88s)]
*  It doesn't, yeah. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2215.88s)]
*  Sneak in a sticky note on our desk that says, have a great day. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2216.88s)]
*  Just little things that actually, it ebbs and flows. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2219.88s)]
*  Don't just keep it going. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2222.88s)]
*  Write that idea down. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2223.88s)]
*  Go on. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2224.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2225.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2226.88s)]
*  You need to learn my handwriting. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2227.88s)]
*  That's what we need to do. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2228.88s)]
*  Doug! [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2229.88s)]
*  Yes, he's back. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2230.88s)]
*  No, a fire one is quick. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2231.88s)]
*  Go sit down. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2232.88s)]
*  Push stick. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2233.88s)]

*  Go sit down. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2238.88s)]
*  Push sticky notes all over the apartment. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2239.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2240.88s)]
*  And then she'll find two one day, and then she'll find three more the next day. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2241.88s)]
*  And she thinks you're putting them down there all week. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2244.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2246.48s)]
*  But really just in one time. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2247.48s)]
*  And then a week later she's like, why do you need so much garbage? [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2248.48s)]
*  I want to find out. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2249.48s)]
*  Can you clean up a little bit? [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2250.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2252.48s)]

*  Have you been listening from the outside? [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2255.48s)]
*  A little bit. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2257.32s)]
*  We have a special coming out too, so it's a lot of effort. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2258.32s)]
*  A lot of effort from Doug. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2261.1600000000003s)]

*  I want the Gucci bag. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2276.56s)]
*  Oh, when mom and dad fight about the effort, they all, oh God. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2278.56s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2281.56s)]
*  But I don't know why, why did we want Doug in here? [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2282.56s)]
*  Oh no, yeah, Arkaush was insulting people. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2284.56s)]
*  Because he was worried about Arkaush and my feelings. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2285.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2286.56s)]
*  When I said yuck and you didn't budge, I knew we were good. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2287.56s)]
*  We're not. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2288.56s)]
*  I knew we had that. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2289.56s)]
*  We're good. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2290.56s)]
*  Yeah, we're good. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2291.56s)]
*  So we're good. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2292.56s)]
*  So we're trying to get to the bottom of this, Doug. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2293.96s)]
*  We're trying to figure out love. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2295.68s)]
*  We're trying to make sure that we enter these great healthy relationships where both sides [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2296.68s)]
*  respect one another. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2300.38s)]
*  Are you a thoughtful person when it comes to the women that you date? [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2301.38s)]
*  Of course. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2303.96s)]
*  Of course. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2304.96s)]
*  Because you're smiling. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2305.96s)]
*  You can't do that. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2306.96s)]
*  Always. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2307.96s)]
*  You know how thoughtful Doug is when it comes to dates? [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2308.96s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2312.16s)]
*  Doug, Doug would go on dates with girls because he is truly trying to find love. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2313.16s)]
*  I give him this a thousand percent. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2317.08s)]
*  He's truly trying to find love. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2318.48s)]
*  And I, Doug is fighting two things. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2320.7599999999998s)]
*  He's fighting thoughtfulness and he's also fighting ethnicity. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2324.0800000000004s)]
*  And I remember like a week or two into living in New York, he would say, here we go, he [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2329.44s)]
*  goes, do you know how much taking a girl out on a date is? [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2333.7200000000003s)]
*  He goes, I'm spending $300, $350 a pop on dinner. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2337.36s)]
*  These girls are drinking like fish. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2342.1200000000003s)]
*  Like what is wrong with this city? [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2344.1600000000003s)]

*  Shit. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2348.8s)]
*  I told him what you passed for that ratio. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2349.8s)]
*  That's how much I passed for that ratio. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2350.8s)]
*  That's some of mine. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2351.8s)]
*  That's the fuck I'm talking about. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2353.8s)]

*  What did you say? [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2360.8s)]
*  Some of my guy friends work in finance and there's a joke because there's a roster and [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2362.8s)]
*  there's a lot of girls and it's a cost per nut ratio. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2370.28s)]
*  So if you were taking girls out on dates like one through three, sometimes you're getting [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2373.32s)]
*  up there. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2380.0800000000004s)]
*  It's almost like $700. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2381.0800000000004s)]
*  So if the cost per nut ends up higher than $800, they would ghost them. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2382.4s)]
*  Really? [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2390.0s)]
*  But that's because they don't really like them. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2391.0s)]
*  They just want to have sex with them. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2392.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2393.12s)]
*  So here's another tricky thing. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2394.12s)]
*  And then I remember I was on Rogan once in this clip that Joe and I were talking about [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2395.12s)]
*  ended up going like pretty viral. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2399.6800000000003s)]
*  And there was this idea that a million guys have talked about. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2401.28s)]
*  There was nothing novel about it, but this post nut clarity. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2403.7200000000003s)]
*  Do you guys remember that? [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2406.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2407.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2408.08s)]
*  So this is the situation that you guys are in where it's like the guy doesn't really [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2409.08s)]
*  know if he likes you until after you guys have slept together and it's. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2413.04s)]
*  Tonya is a guy. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2421.2799999999997s)]
*  I know. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2422.68s)]
*  I know. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2423.68s)]
*  She really is a guy. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2424.68s)]
*  That's my nigger right there. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2425.68s)]
*  That's a dead ass. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2426.68s)]
*  Don't you say it Tonya. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2427.68s)]
*  That's going to be walking around. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2428.68s)]
*  Okay. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2429.68s)]
*  So we're going to talk about this. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2430.68s)]
*  So we're going to talk about this. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2431.68s)]
*  So we're going to talk about this. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2432.68s)]
*  So we're going to talk about this. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2433.68s)]
*  So we're going to talk about this. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2434.68s)]
*  So we're going to talk about this. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2435.68s)]
*  So we're going to talk about this. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2436.68s)]
*  So we're going to talk about this. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2437.68s)]
*  So are women aware of that or not? [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2439.2799999999997s)]
*  Women are aware of that. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2442.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2443.48s)]
*  And I think that's the conversation amongst yourselves about that. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2444.48s)]
*  It's unfortunate that women actually like once they sleep with you, like will then become [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2447.52s)]
*  more attached and the timelines are completely opposite. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2454.2999999999997s)]
*  So like once you have sex, the man is like, okay, yeah, like, okay, maybe does fine. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2457.2s)]
*  Maybe I don't like her that much. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2462.64s)]
*  Meanwhile, once she has sex with you, she has all these hormones where she's saying, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2463.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh my God, I love him. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2467.84s)]
*  Oh my God, I need to be near him. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2468.84s)]
*  Even though they're illogical, you're like fighting this like avalanche inside your body [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2469.84s)]
*  being like, I need to spend time with that person. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2473.44s)]
*  Pre-sex is different where the man is more invested and you're kind of like, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2475.2000000000003s)]
*  The timelines are completely opposite. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2477.6400000000003s)]
*  Men use love to get sex. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2479.6400000000003s)]
*  Women use sex to get love. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2481.2000000000003s)]
*  Oh, right. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2482.2000000000003s)]
*  The other way. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2483.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2484.2000000000003s)]
*  No, I think women use sex to get love. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2485.2000000000003s)]
*  You're right. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2486.2000000000003s)]
*  You got it. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2487.2000000000003s)]
*  So men use love to get sex. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2488.2000000000003s)]
*  And this is the, what is that? [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2489.2000000000003s)]
*  The playboy method or something like that where you're really nice to them in the beginning. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2491.5600000000004s)]
*  The love bombing or something like that. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2495.1200000000003s)]
*  I honestly don't think that you can look at that and say like, Oh, it's purposeful love [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2498.2s)]
*  bombing or like purposefully. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2501.4s)]
*  No, I think it's quite genuine. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2502.4s)]
*  I think it's genuine. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2503.8s)]
*  I think they genuinely believe, Oh my gosh, I'm going to get to know her. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2504.8s)]
*  I'm going to have sex with her. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2507.0s)]
*  But then somehow like chemically, once it happens, it's like, all right. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2508.0s)]
*  And now we look like a fuck boy when in reality, we never really liked that person as much [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2511.12s)]
*  as we truly thought we did. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2516.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2517.72s)]
*  And then the women look like a psycho, but they're just kind of like, what's happening [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2518.72s)]
*  in my brain? [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2521.16s)]
*  And our ego gets hit like crazy because we're like, yeah, she didn't really like me that [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2522.16s)]
*  much until I gave her that. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2524.72s)]
*  She will stop calling it. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2526.9599999999996s)]
*  That's why I think she's good at sex. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2528.9599999999996s)]
*  I didn't understand this as a guy who was a virgin. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2530.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2532.48s)]
*  When we're not, it's just this, oh, how advantageous for us. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2533.48s)]
*  A chemical gets released in your head after sex where you love us that much more, no matter [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2536.72s)]
*  how bad the sex is. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2541.4399999999996s)]
*  Oxytocin. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2542.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2543.7599999999998s)]
*  Billie Eilish has a song about it. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2544.7599999999998s)]
*  Really? [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2545.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2546.7599999999998s)]
*  Even if it's bad sex. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2547.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't think that's true. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2548.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't think it's bad sex. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2549.7599999999998s)]
*  I got it. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2550.7599999999998s)]
*  Fuck you. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2551.7599999999998s)]
*  I always do. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2552.7599999999998s)]
*  It's so good. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2553.7599999999998s)]
*  I love it. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2554.8s)]
*  I love it. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2555.8s)]

*  I love it. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2557.8s)]
*  So is there, is there- [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2558.8s)]
*  Gail, stop crying. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2559.8s)]
*  My brother listens to his podcast. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2560.8s)]
*  Alright. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2563.8s)]
*  Sorry, Gail's brother, we love you. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2564.8s)]
*  So it is possible that sex can be so bad that you're like, I don't really want to, the oxytocin [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2566.6400000000003s)]
*  doesn't get released. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2572.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2573.7200000000003s)]
*  I also think it's like not all women, not all men. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2574.7200000000003s)]
*  Like it's just, that is a thing that can happen. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2577.48s)]
*  We're speaking in generalizations of course. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2579.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, in generalizations. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2580.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2581.2000000000003s)]
*  That can happen and that's where the Taylor Swift, Lana Del Rey like getting fixated on [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2582.64s)]
*  like, oh, like I love him. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2587.08s)]
*  This like, I don't know, depressive job. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2588.9399999999996s)]
*  Let's tie in the effort to the sex. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2590.96s)]
*  What if when you have sex, there's no effort and it's all about him. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2593.74s)]
*  Define effort. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2598.12s)]
*  Because I feel like for us just not coming fast is the most effort we can make. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2599.12s)]
*  You can tell if there's like- [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2602.2s)]
*  How much more effort can we put in? [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2603.2s)]
*  I've been thinking of my dead grandma for three minutes. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2606.2s)]
*  Like come on. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2609.2s)]
*  Three minutes. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2610.2s)]
*  I don't want no effort in. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2611.2s)]
*  Come on. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2612.2s)]
*  She just died. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2613.2s)]
*  I just got over this. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2614.2s)]
*  Come on, bro. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2615.2s)]
*  Like is he like, is he like, what's the foreplay like? [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2616.2s)]
*  Is he going down on you? [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2621.2s)]

*  Fingered your wallet. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2644.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2645.2s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2646.2s)]
*  Okay, yeah. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2647.2s)]
*  So an attention to satisfying you, not just being satisfied. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2648.2s)]
*  First, because once you guys come game over- [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2651.2s)]

*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2655.2s)]
*  We have to come first, a max effort. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2656.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2657.2s)]
*  And then I'll get that thing that you just talked about. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2658.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2659.2s)]
*  What is that? [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2660.2s)]
*  What is the thing? [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2661.2s)]
*  The thing in the brain that oxygen is. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2662.2s)]
*  That weird thing that we have to do. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2663.2s)]
*  She's in denial, bro. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2665.2s)]
*  The biology is- [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2668.2s)]
*  I'll say that. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2669.2s)]
*  If the sex is bad, immediately you're written off goodbye. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2670.2s)]
*  100%. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2672.2s)]
*  I was assuming that that was the case, that the sex was good. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2673.2s)]
*  Let me draw out an outlier, okay? [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2676.2s)]
*  This is a tricky one. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2679.2s)]
*  But I have seen, okay, I have friends who hooked up with this girl. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2681.2s)]
*  He's a gay. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2686.2s)]
*  He's a gay. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2688.2s)]
*  He's a gay. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2689.2s)]
*  He's a gay. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2690.2s)]
*  I have friends who hooked up with this girl. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2691.2s)]
*  He was like, dude, I fucking couldn't get it up. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2694.2s)]
*  That girl became obsessed with him. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2698.2s)]
*  Really? [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2700.2s)]
*  Daddy issues. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2701.2s)]
*  My dad could never get it up. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2702.2s)]
*  Reminds me a lot of him, to be honest. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2705.2s)]
*  Now, is there a part of that where it's like, like they dated, like they dated for years. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2708.2s)]
*  What? [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2715.2s)]
*  And now I, this is what I chalked it up to. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2716.2s)]
*  I chalked it up to her going, that made me feel really rejected. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2718.2s)]
*  And I'm wondering from the female perspective, is there a part of it where it's like, I've [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2722.2s)]
*  never had a guy not get it up with me. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2725.2s)]
*  I feel rejected. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2727.2s)]
*  I feel ugly. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2728.2s)]
*  I'm going to win him over. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2730.2s)]
*  I'm going to prove to him that I can get him hard or whatever so that I like myself. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2731.2s)]
*  Maybe like a very young person might think that, but that seems pretty like immature. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2737.2s)]
*  Like there really is no correlation between like how you look or your behavior to that. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2743.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2749.2s)]
*  Would you still write that guy off if you're saying there's no correlation between whatever? [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2750.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2753.2s)]
*  100%. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2754.2s)]
*  He got close to the mic like a fucking senator, dude. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2755.2s)]
*  It depends. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2758.2s)]
*  Is this like a kind of guy, like it's like you've been dating, everything was perfect. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2759.2s)]
*  No, you guys are getting along. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2763.2s)]
*  It's great. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2764.2s)]
*  You guys are getting along. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2765.2s)]
*  Then one night you went out drinking till five o'clock in the morning, maybe did some [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2766.2s)]
*  other stuff. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2768.2s)]
*  Whiskey dick is different. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2769.2s)]
*  And then you get whiskey dick. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2770.2s)]
*  That's forgivable. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2771.2s)]
*  So and what happens in those moments? [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=2772.2s)]

*  You give up easily. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3158.3199999999997s)]
*  My friends here, they feel like dating is tricky because the girls are handling five [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3159.32s)]
*  or six guys and one guy could be better. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3165.36s)]
*  And what are my options? [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3167.88s)]
*  Same vice versa. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3168.88s)]
*  But do you, I haven't heard you guys talk about that at all. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3169.88s)]
*  Do you feel that way? [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3172.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3173.44s)]
*  So, so you're like, I don't really know if I like this guy. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3174.44s)]
*  And now if you have five guys that you don't really know if you like, you're probably looking [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3177.1200000000003s)]
*  at these like X or red flags way more than if you had one guy in your hometown that you [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3180.2000000000003s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3186.0800000000004s)]
*  I was using things to rule people out that like seem kind of cruel. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3187.08s)]
*  I said this to a friend. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3190.4s)]
*  I was like, oh yeah, well like he's sober and AA. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3191.4s)]
*  So like he's done. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3193.36s)]
*  And she was like, well, those people deserve love. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3194.36s)]
*  I was like, no, not for me. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3195.7999999999997s)]

*  You know what's so funny? [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3280.72s)]
*  Dove is such a girl because the first thing he says when he meets a new girl is like, [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3282.72s)]
*  she's actually an engineer and she works for whatever and I'm like, [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3286.72s)]
*  nobody asked what her fucking occupation was. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3290.72s)]
*  Show us the video that doesn't have a filter. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3292.72s)]
*  So we can get like an accurate assessment. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3294.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's all visual. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3296.72s)]
*  I knew a guy's girl was really hot when I said, [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3298.72s)]
*  see a picture and he just handed me the phone and he didn't hand select a picture. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3300.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3304.72s)]
*  That's a lot. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3306.72s)]
*  Okay, what do you guys feel about like how you look on Instagram versus reality? [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3308.72s)]
*  Like do you feel when you go to a date, like everybody looks better on Instagram for sure, [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3314.72s)]
*  but now with all these filters and shit, is there ever a moment like where you only talk to this person online, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3318.72s)]
*  he's only seen what you guys present online and then in person you're like, [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3324.72s)]
*  is he going to think that I'm as attractive? [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3328.72s)]
*  Like, is there any of that insecurity that comes out? [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3330.72s)]
*  There wasn't any until one time a guy showed up a hundred pounds heavier. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3332.72s)]
*  Oh, no, I'm talking about on you guys. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3336.72s)]
*  Oh, not the guys. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3338.72s)]
*  Hold on, hold on. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3340.72s)]
*  So guys are catfishing too? [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3342.72s)]
*  Wait, I ran for the help. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3344.72s)]
*  No. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3346.72s)]
*  I fucking laughed. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3348.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3350.72s)]
*  I think I do hear from my guy friends of like, oh, she misrepresented herself. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3352.72s)]
*  And I'm like, okay, that's a nice way to say that she wasn't as hot as the pictures. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3356.72s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3360.72s)]
*  I think everyone's using four-year-old pictures, but I also think for us looking at a guy's profile, [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3362.72s)]
*  if I'm going to show my friends, like they're all like the first thing is like, oh, well, they look better in person. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3368.72s)]
*  Like men are given more permission to look shitty on Instagram because it's like, oh, like they don't take pics. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3372.72s)]
*  What about this? [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3378.72s)]
*  A lot of guys, some of whom are on this podcast, will lie about their height. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3380.72s)]
*  How does that make you feel? [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3382.72s)]
*  That does not make me feel good as a 5'9'' lady. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3384.72s)]
*  Like I don't want you to come and be embarrassed. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3386.72s)]
*  You know, I don't want to meet you at the restaurant and you'd be like, oh, I shouldn't have lied. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3388.72s)]
*  Do you pay for dinner if you're taller? [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3392.72s)]
*  I walk away if I'm taller. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3396.72s)]
*  Wait, so the height is a huge thing. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3398.72s)]
*  Like you cannot date a guy. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3400.72s)]
*  The honesty, I think, right? [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3402.72s)]
*  Yeah, just honesty, but also like, yeah, maybe I could date a guy that's shorter, but it's like, [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3404.72s)]
*  if I'm looking for reasons to rule them out, that's a big one. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3408.72s)]
*  Because I don't want them to resent me for being taller than them. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3410.72s)]
*  Like I don't want them to have any male ego about how they look. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3414.72s)]
*  You think a guy who's shorter would have a male ego about being with a taller girl? [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3416.72s)]
*  You wouldn't see him as like a badge of honor? [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3420.72s)]
*  He'd be like, oh my God, look at this. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3422.72s)]
*  Well, that's why girls call them short kings. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3424.72s)]
*  The ones who are not insecure about it. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3426.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3428.72s)]
*  Got it. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3430.72s)]
*  But like, if they're shorter than you and then they misrepresent themselves, [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3432.72s)]
*  Mike. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3434.72s)]
*  Why would you want to continue to date them? [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3436.72s)]
*  That's how we feel if you're not as attractive. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3438.72s)]
*  But for you it's height specifically. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3440.72s)]
*  Not just... [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3442.72s)]
*  It's like height and weight. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3444.72s)]
*  Fair, fair. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3446.72s)]
*  Girls are just as shallow. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3448.72s)]
*  Especially in New York. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3450.72s)]
*  But I think the apps have like really increased the levels of shallow, [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3452.72s)]
*  because that's the only thing that we can judge on. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3454.72s)]
*  Whereas back in the day, you'd meet someone at a bar, [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3456.72s)]
*  you knew kind of how tall they were immediately. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3458.72s)]
*  You knew what they looked like pretty much. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3460.72s)]
*  Yeah, you just hoped you were drunk enough. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3462.72s)]
*  Like how drunk you? [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3464.72s)]
*  What if a guy has a picture with like three of his boys [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3466.72s)]
*  and he's the least attractive one in the group? [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3468.72s)]
*  Oh my God, bad. Always bad. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3470.72s)]
*  What are you doing? What an idiot. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3472.72s)]
*  Wait, why is that bad? [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3474.72s)]
*  Okay, so then you're going to the date and you're hoping... [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3476.72s)]
*  Because, okay, with all these pictures, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3478.72s)]
*  I'm looking at all these different profiles. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3480.72s)]
*  I'm not quite grasping which one you are. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3482.72s)]
*  I'm just hoping it's the guy on the left. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3484.72s)]
*  I'm hoping, I'm hoping you don't know. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3486.72s)]
*  It's no way you'll go on a date [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3488.72s)]
*  and you don't even know which one of the three guys it is. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3490.72s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3492.72s)]
*  It happens. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3494.72s)]
*  Usually there's one picture with a group [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3496.72s)]
*  and the rest are like solo [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3498.72s)]
*  so you can figure out which one it is. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3500.72s)]
*  Are you asking, are we going to date the ugliest guy in their group [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3502.72s)]
*  or you're not sure who the guy is? [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3504.72s)]
*  Yeah, would that be an issue if he was the ugliest guy in the group? [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3506.72s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3508.72s)]
*  It's not an issue, but you're doing yourself a disservice [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3510.72s)]
*  posting something on your profile [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3512.72s)]
*  where your boy looks hotter. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3514.72s)]
*  But that's your boy. What does it matter? [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3516.72s)]
*  We don't care about that. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3518.72s)]
*  You're out here to get ladies. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3520.72s)]
*  This is the place to get ladies. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3522.72s)]
*  You're supposed to not have hot friends. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3524.72s)]
*  There was a girl. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3526.72s)]
*  I'm waiting for the funny ugly one. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3528.72s)]
*  There was a girl. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3530.72s)]
*  There's a lot of women that feel that way, thank god. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3532.72s)]
*  Talking about the a lot of DMs. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3534.72s)]
*  Make your profile private. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3536.72s)]
*  I am so ugly. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3538.72s)]
*  Girl. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3540.72s)]
*  I made a happy relationship. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3542.72s)]
*  Don't PM me. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3544.72s)]
*  There was a girl in my sorority who lost a ton of weight [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3546.72s)]
*  and she kept her profile photos of her 20 pounds heavier [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3548.72s)]
*  so that they would be like, [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3550.72s)]
*  oh my god, she's so hot when they met her in person. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3552.72s)]
*  How many people met her in person? [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3554.72s)]
*  A good amount. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3556.72s)]
*  Really? [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3558.72s)]
*  Fatty's deserve love too. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3560.72s)]
*  No, I think that's a bad idea [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3562.72s)]
*  because you want to get as many [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3564.72s)]
*  like you want to get the best you can get. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3566.72s)]
*  Now that you were talking for this body, [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3568.72s)]
*  go get what you want. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3570.72s)]
*  Yeah, but then there's also something to that like [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3572.72s)]
*  if your mentality is get the best [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3574.72s)]
*  and you know you're getting DMs [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3576.72s)]
*  or you're connecting with all these people on these apps, [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3578.72s)]
*  your brain is always going to be looking for [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3580.72s)]
*  a little bit better thing instead of looking [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3582.72s)]
*  for the thing that you want. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3584.72s)]
*  It's mental illness. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3586.72s)]
*  What's happening is not a good thing. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3588.72s)]
*  That's important to say. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3590.72s)]
*  I'm just describing what's happening. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3592.72s)]
*  This is not a way to like meet your soulmate. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3594.72s)]
*  So maybe girls should get off the apps. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3596.72s)]
*  Seems like it's just making life harder for you. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3598.72s)]
*  Maybe, but I still want to drive home the point of like [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3600.72s)]
*  the effort thing is not working. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3602.72s)]
*  But what if it's hard for us? [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3604.72s)]
*  I wish it wasn't. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3606.72s)]
*  I think that that's kind of like the [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3608.72s)]
*  I'm like why is this so [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3610.72s)]
*  why don't you feel like an intrinsic motivation [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3612.72s)]
*  to like surprise and delight the person that you're with? [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3614.72s)]
*  It does feel really good. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3616.72s)]
*  It does feel really good to do. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3618.72s)]
*  I will be honest. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3620.72s)]
*  It feels really good. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3622.72s)]
*  And then when you make them happy, [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3624.72s)]
*  there is like a feeling of euphoria that comes from it. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3626.72s)]
*  But I will say it is [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3628.72s)]
*  it's not like the most natural instinct [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3630.72s)]
*  that we have. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3632.72s)]
*  The more natural instinct is like how do I provide? [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3634.72s)]
*  How do I make sure that we're safe? [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3636.72s)]
*  If somebody disrespects them, how do I make sure [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3638.72s)]
*  that like they don't know that I'm afraid to fight them? [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3640.72s)]
*  Buy a gun. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3642.72s)]
*  Red state, no. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3644.72s)]
*  We gotta move to red states. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3646.72s)]
*  Buy a gun. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3648.72s)]
*  In all honesty though, I agree with what Andrew is saying. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3650.72s)]
*  Like when I was like dating, I thought about like [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3652.72s)]
*  the primary values first, [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3654.72s)]
*  not like the stupid other shit. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3656.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3658.72s)]
*  The primary values. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3660.72s)]
*  Jewish. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3662.72s)]
*  The trick is to be Jewish. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3664.72s)]
*  Because that will is the town. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3666.72s)]
*  It was like [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3668.72s)]
*  respect, generosity, [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3670.72s)]
*  like that need to like care [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3672.72s)]
*  for me and have a future and not fuck around. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3674.72s)]
*  Like all that other stuff was more [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3676.72s)]
*  important than like I don't give a fuck about flowers. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3678.72s)]
*  I kill them in a day anyway. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3680.72s)]
*  I guess that will be given [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3682.72s)]
*  to me. Like if you're in a relationship [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3684.72s)]
*  But to me that is a lot of [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3686.72s)]
*  the effort is like those like [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3688.72s)]
*  primary things first [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3690.72s)]
*  and then everything else is kind of like icing on the cake. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3692.72s)]
*  Like if he doesn't send me [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3694.72s)]
*  a playlist or [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3696.72s)]
*  send me flowers [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3698.72s)]
*  but like on a day to day basis [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3700.72s)]
*  there's like respect. And also [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3702.72s)]
*  like little things I think like effort like [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3704.72s)]
*  for example, Zach when it's cold outside [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3706.72s)]
*  he like walks Frankie. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3708.72s)]
*  That's what I'm talking about. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3710.72s)]
*  But that's effort but that also comes down to like [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3712.72s)]
*  he takes care of me. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3714.72s)]
*  Filling up your water. That's a big one. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3716.72s)]
*  Which one? Filling up the girls water. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3718.72s)]
*  Metaphorical water. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3720.72s)]
*  To go to the kitchen, fill up both. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3722.72s)]
*  Fill up the water. Little stuff like that. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3724.72s)]
*  Men fill up the water. That's what it is. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3726.72s)]
*  That's not the same as like [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3728.72s)]
*  making reservations [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3730.72s)]
*  and sending flowers and like surprising [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3732.72s)]
*  me with all these other things. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3734.72s)]
*  I think walking your dog is like on that level. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3736.72s)]
*  But we've divided. I think [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3738.72s)]
*  you're getting neither as women in general. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3740.72s)]
*  No hold on. It doesn't require planning. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3742.72s)]
*  That's the difference. No, no. We've devised this system [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3744.72s)]
*  where we did things that showcase [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3746.72s)]
*  effort. And I think [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3748.72s)]
*  we started to call it chivalry. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3750.72s)]
*  And then it just became expected. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3752.72s)]
*  And now it's no longer seen as [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3754.72s)]
*  effort because it is the expectation [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3756.72s)]
*  of our gender. And [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3758.72s)]
*  so now we're going outside [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3760.72s)]
*  of our gender expectation. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3762.72s)]
*  I.e. writing a card. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3764.72s)]
*  Which is not natural to us. Right? [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3766.72s)]
*  Fighting some guy in a bar is [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3768.72s)]
*  an extraordinary fucking effort. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3770.72s)]
*  Right? That we have to do that's expected of us. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3772.72s)]
*  But we don't. I don't know if we get [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3774.72s)]
*  the same credit for doing it because if you [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3776.72s)]
*  don't do it, you're a bitch. How could you not [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3778.72s)]
*  support your girl? Whatever. I gotta pretend [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3780.72s)]
*  I'm willing to fight. Even though we both. No, I'm not. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3782.72s)]
*  It's a lie we both maintain. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3784.72s)]
*  But no, on some serious shit. I wonder if we've [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3786.72s)]
*  done a bad job of that. Like we should never [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3788.72s)]
*  coined it as chivalry. We should have never even [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3790.72s)]
*  spoken about it and just done it. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3792.72s)]
*  And then when it happened to you guys, you'd be like, oh, that was [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3794.72s)]
*  so nice and thoughtful of them. But now all the things [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3796.72s)]
*  that are kind of like a little bit more natural, [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3798.72s)]
*  the things that we do, opening a door, [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3800.72s)]
*  obviously paying for dinner and doing these [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3802.72s)]
*  types of things are the expectation. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3804.72s)]
*  But the problem is. So now we gotta do girly shit [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3806.72s)]
*  so y'all know that we like you. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3808.72s)]
*  You're. Where Gen Z. Buying a car [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3810.72s)]
*  that's not in our wheelhouse at all. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3812.72s)]
*  Down here. Okay, where's Gen Z? [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3814.72s)]
*  Chivalry in Gen Z is dead. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3816.72s)]
*  They don't know how to open doors. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3818.72s)]
*  You think that's more of a New York thing? [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3820.72s)]
*  Because I grew up in the South. That's [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3822.72s)]
*  the expectation. Whole doors open. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3824.72s)]
*  But that's the South. It's like different in New York. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3826.72s)]
*  I think what Andrew is saying about the like being willing to fight someone in a bar. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3828.72s)]
*  It's a stupid example, but. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3834.72s)]
*  It's a fine point, but it's so rare. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3836.72s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3838.72s)]
*  Like that could happen once every two years. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3840.72s)]
*  A fight isn't a real thing, but it's more about like somebody being rude to you. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3842.72s)]
*  You want your man to protect you. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3846.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's just that's just so rare. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3848.72s)]
*  So the sticky note gets you to the like. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3850.72s)]
*  Some guy gawking at you on the street and then making him feel uncomfortable for doing that is not actually a fair thing. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3852.72s)]
*  But it's this little example of hey, I'm going to protect you. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3857.72s)]
*  And you're like, I don't like this guy. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3860.72s)]
*  That's awesome. Like keep doing that. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3862.72s)]
*  I yeah, that's awesome. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3864.72s)]
*  But my point is it's expected. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3866.72s)]
*  And you guys maybe I don't know, but maybe you don't see it as the same effort as like getting you a card. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3868.72s)]
*  But in our minds, we're like, hey, this is me showing that you're really important to me. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3873.72s)]
*  And there's this weird homeless guy walking on the street. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3877.72s)]
*  I'm going to move you this side just in case anything happens. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3880.72s)]
*  And I wonder if you clock it the same way like, oh, that was really thoughtful that he did that. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3882.72s)]
*  I think that that's not like a given. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3886.72s)]
*  I don't think all the guys out there are doing that. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3890.72s)]
*  No one has moved me around from a creepy guy. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3892.72s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3895.72s)]
*  You're fine. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3897.72s)]
*  No, you can fight. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3899.72s)]
*  You can fight. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3901.72s)]
*  I only date guys who are significantly older than me because men in our generation are the worst. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3903.72s)]
*  This is interesting. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3909.72s)]
*  Speak on this. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3910.72s)]
*  Yes. So you said that your generation is known for dating much older men. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3911.72s)]
*  Sorry. Can we ask how old you are? [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3916.72s)]
*  I'm 22. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3918.72s)]
*  Like my last boyfriend was 31. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3919.72s)]
*  So like an old guy, 31. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3922.72s)]
*  That's my wife. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3926.72s)]
*  We both started dating. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3927.72s)]
*  That's funny. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3928.72s)]
*  But you also said that as well. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3929.72s)]
*  So and is that is that a thing that like your generation is known for? [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3931.72s)]
*  Do people talk about this or is this kind of like an unsaid statistic? [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3934.72s)]
*  I feel like a lot of my friends do. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3937.72s)]
*  Like I feel like it's like the norm. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3939.72s)]
*  I don't want to say that it's like, oh, like Gen Z because it's like the biggest cliche in the book that like dudes in their 30s want to date 22 year olds. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3941.72s)]
*  Like that is how life kind of works. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3949.72s)]
*  But I think it's happening for Gen Z because these guys because no one is. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3952.72s)]
*  Oh, sorry. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3956.72s)]
*  Because no one's like moving me away from the creepy guy or like doing those things. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3957.72s)]
*  Maybe a 35 year old might know to do that. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3961.72s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3963.72s)]
*  They're like walking on the outside of the sidewalk. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3964.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3966.72s)]
*  Like when you're walking down the street, like they'll go on that. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3967.72s)]
*  That is just something that should naturally happen. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3970.72s)]
*  Like if you date someone who's like 23, just moved to New York is like, oh, my God, this is the best. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3972.72s)]
*  You're really playing tour guide and it's like miserable. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3978.72s)]
*  And their only socialization is fucking video games. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3981.72s)]
*  Like their their brains are like rotted. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3985.72s)]
*  But do you think this is a problem of also how your generation kind of brought that on themselves with the whole like equality thing? [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3988.72s)]
*  It's like you want everything to be equal. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3996.72s)]
*  And I'm like, OK, yes. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=3998.72s)]
*  This was an audio only podcast, like revealing the video of her and it's just one of us in a wig. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4000.72s)]
*  But it's like that is a thing that happened. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4006.72s)]
*  I need you to that happened with the whole society being like, oh, men and women are exactly equal. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4012.72s)]
*  Everything is the exact same. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4019.72s)]
*  And you guys made it seem like it looks that they're looking down upon you. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4020.72s)]
*  If they treat you a certain way, so then they just naturally start stopping doing things. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4024.72s)]
*  So I think there was real quick, real quick. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4029.72s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4032.72s)]
*  But like, but I think there is a little bit of that. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4034.72s)]
*  Like I've spoken to younger guys about this and there was a little bit of a concern about doing some more chivalrous acts and it coming across as like almost condescending. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4036.72s)]
*  And so I think there was a hesitation because they're like, oh, I don't want them to think that like they're this helpless little girl that can't do anything. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4046.72s)]
*  So they pulled back from maybe some of these efforts. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4053.72s)]
*  Well, we would call them chivalry, but like some of the effort the men did that actually did make you feel good. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4057.72s)]
*  And now I don't want to say you're craving it, but it is comforting when you're dating the older guys and they do do it. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4061.72s)]
*  Maybe I have like really well, I grew up here, so I have like really woke friends and like normal people friends. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4066.72s)]
*  No, I'm so serious. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4073.72s)]
*  I have friends who like if the guy pays on the first date, like she's going to insist like she's going to shove it down there. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4075.72s)]
*  I'm going to split like, no, we should split. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4081.72s)]
*  I'm never going to do that because like I'm half Chinese. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4084.72s)]
*  It's not my culture. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4093.72s)]
*  I had a guy one time he was like, you know, I think when you're in a relationship, you split every single thing down the middle, even like a cup of coffee. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4095.72s)]
*  And I looked at him and I go, that's not in my culture. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4101.719999999999s)]
*  Unfortunately, we drink tea. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4104.719999999999s)]
*  Okay. So is that possible though? [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4109.72s)]
*  Is it your generation? [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4111.72s)]
*  The guys are actually trying to do the thing that they think you want, which is to treat you as equals and to get rid of these like gender restrictions. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4112.72s)]
*  But some of them actually make you feel good. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4120.72s)]
*  Now you're dating these older guys just so you can get that nice comforting feeling of effort and love. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4123.72s)]
*  I'm going to voice something that I do not think is a good thing, but I think is true is that there you get more permission to do those chivalrous things that maybe [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4128.72s)]
*  might come off as like creepy or too forward or like infantilizing you. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4138.72s)]
*  You get more permission to do that the hotter you are. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4142.72s)]
*  Okay. I do feel that way. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4146.72s)]
*  Like if a gross guy hits on you in the grocery store, it's like, get away from me or like or you know, does a protective action. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4149.72s)]
*  It's like, oh, I didn't fucking need that. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4156.72s)]
*  But if it's like a six, five, you know, could be the one. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4157.72s)]
*  You're like, yeah, I do need help. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4161.72s)]
*  It feeds into like the fairy tales and all that shit. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4164.72s)]
*  Yeah, 100 percent. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4167.72s)]
*  So I think, yeah, I don't know what the advice there is, but I do observe that happening. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4168.72s)]
*  I think the advice is there are no rules. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4173.72s)]
*  If you're hot. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4176.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4177.72s)]
*  That goes for women too. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4178.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4179.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4180.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4181.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4182.72s)]
*  So here's a question about the chivalry thing that it became kind of the expectation. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4183.72s)]
*  It feels like with men, the expectation back in the day was this is where it was maybe smart on women's part. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4188.72s)]
*  Expectation was you cook, you clean, whatever. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4194.72s)]
*  And now when a woman does those things, that's really thoughtful. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4196.72s)]
*  And we ain't asking for that's great. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4198.72s)]
*  You get the chivalry and you're asking for thoughtfulness. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4200.72s)]
*  Whereas on the other end, if you're doing the things that were expected back then, you are like, that's thoughtful. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4204.72s)]
*  So can you understand maybe our psychology of like, well, we're being chivalrous. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4209.72s)]
*  Isn't that thoughtful? [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4213.72s)]
*  What is this extra shit? [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4214.72s)]
*  That's an interesting point. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4215.72s)]
*  Like maybe we digested the same way. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4216.72s)]
*  When a woman would cook, clean, do all those things back in the day, the guy was like, well, yeah, I'm working. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4218.72s)]
*  Like, what the hell are you going to do all day? [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4222.72s)]
*  You better do it. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4224.72s)]
*  And you're like, hey, no, I'm making this house beautiful for you. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4225.72s)]
*  And I made this meal beautiful. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4227.72s)]
*  And I went to the market. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4228.72s)]
*  I got all these, you know, fresh foods. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4229.72s)]
*  You get delicious meal and you're not even caring about it. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4231.72s)]
*  And now it's almost reversed. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4233.72s)]
*  Now you're like, how dare you expect that? [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4235.72s)]
*  So we don't. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4237.72s)]
*  And when you do it, we're like, wow, that's thoughtful. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4238.72s)]
*  But that is still expected. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4240.72s)]
*  That is still expected. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4241.72s)]
*  Women are exhausted from working all day. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4242.72s)]
*  And then, like, you know, when men get married to women, their quality of life improves. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4244.72s)]
*  They remember to brush their teeth. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4248.72s)]
*  That's true. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4250.72s)]
*  You know, they are taken care of in a way that is just natural. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4251.72s)]
*  If you're living in my house, yeah, I'm going to make sure the dishes are done. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4254.72s)]
*  And like, you know, it's just like, I love you. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4257.72s)]
*  It's a done deal. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4259.72s)]
*  I think women are doing both the domestic and labor outside. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4260.72s)]
*  And then men are considering chivalry as equal to like cooking a crazy Sunday night meal like that took hours and shopping and an effort. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4264.72s)]
*  You need to do more if you're putting those as like the extracurriculars outside of working. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4272.72s)]
*  The housework is way harder than like stepping to a guy. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4277.72s)]
*  I think push back. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4280.72s)]
*  It does seem like a lot more couples there's eating out a lot more Uber eats a lot more restaurants, date nights, cleaning ladies even. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4282.72s)]
*  So for y'all, it is completely natural to say I'm working. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4288.72s)]
*  I'm not trying to do all that. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4292.72s)]
*  I think in healthier couples that I see, it's very much like, well, yes, so don't we'll figure that out. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4293.72s)]
*  You don't have to do that. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4298.72s)]
*  That's not expected of you. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4299.72s)]
*  But it's still us expected of men. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4300.72s)]
*  Generally, the chivalry is expected now go above and beyond. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4302.72s)]
*  Whereas if we if you were working and cooking and cleaning, a guy was complaining to his dude friends, he might just do a lot of different. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4305.72s)]
*  Be like, shut the fuck up, dude. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4311.72s)]
*  Your wife works. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4312.72s)]
*  She cooks. She clean. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4313.72s)]
*  You're a fucking loser. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4314.72s)]
*  I think it's a cultural thing. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4315.72s)]
*  Sounds pretty good. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4317.72s)]
*  Like, Span like think about the households where like Sunday dinners are really important, like Spanish household Italians. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4318.72s)]
*  Like, I think the where you were raised and like where you come from plays such a huge role into that. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4326.72s)]
*  Yeah, curates the expectations you have for yourself. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4332.72s)]
*  Because like, I feel like I love cooking like that's something like I enjoy. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4335.72s)]
*  Like, I don't mind clean kitchen, but like, you should be carrying the groceries and like, I could go pick them up. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4338.72s)]
*  I could do whatever. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4343.72s)]
*  Like, I'm going to leave them on stairs. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4344.72s)]
*  You should be carrying them upstairs. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4345.72s)]
*  So maybe like little things. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4347.72s)]
*  So maybe the pendulum is swinging around a little bit and we have to just come to this, you know, kind of middle ground where you have to state clearly what you're doing. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4348.72s)]
*  Like, clearly what your expectations are of us. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4355.72s)]
*  What is the baseline? [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4358.72s)]
*  Well, that's impossible. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4359.72s)]
*  Then that's your fault. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4360.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4361.72s)]
*  Because I think we know what our expectations are of you guys. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4362.72s)]
*  We know what is the baseline and we know what makes us feel good when you go a little bit above the baseline. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4366.72s)]
*  And can you just tell me what the expectations are just so I know? [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4371.72s)]
*  Because I don't quite know. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4374.72s)]
*  It's opposite. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4376.72s)]
*  Way the same. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4377.72s)]
*  I think it's like, I think it's like, it's like hygiene, obviously in the initial, like shaved. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4378.72s)]
*  Is that the hygiene? [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4387.72s)]
*  Like what is the list? [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4389.72s)]
*  I'm pretty sure. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4390.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4391.72s)]
*  Smell good. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4392.72s)]
*  Maybe it's because I date Indian women, but like, come on. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4393.72s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4396.72s)]
*  Hair was. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4397.72s)]
*  I thought you were talking about hygiene. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4398.72s)]
*  That shaving shit is. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4404.72s)]
*  Come on. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4406.72s)]
*  That shaving shit is. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4407.72s)]
*  Come on. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4408.72s)]
*  Okay. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4409.72s)]
*  Expect it. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4410.72s)]
*  Yes. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4411.72s)]
*  I think there are those like baseline, like, okay, just be hot expectations, right? [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4412.72s)]
*  Which sounds like, I guess it even sounds annoying describing it to you guys. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4416.72s)]
*  But if I don't say it, then I'm not being honest, right? [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4419.72s)]
*  So I think that there is that like a care to look beautiful. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4422.72s)]
*  I think that that matters, right? [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4427.72s)]
*  And then just maintain it. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4429.72s)]
*  It's not like saying you can't fucking like schlep around the sweats or whatever. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4431.72s)]
*  That's fun too. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4434.72s)]
*  But like, it is nice to know that that something you guys value. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4435.72s)]
*  100%. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4438.72s)]
*  I think like a curiosity and care about us. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4439.72s)]
*  Maybe it's just because we're comedians, but that's important to me. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4441.72s)]
*  Like me and my wife having conversation, her wanting to know what's going on in my life, [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4444.72s)]
*  like me taking interest in what's going on in hers, like those really caring and like supporting. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4447.72s)]
*  The cooking and the cleaning stuff is extra. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4452.72s)]
*  It's like an added bonus. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4455.72s)]
*  But do you care about me? [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4457.72s)]
*  Do you care about what's going on in my life? [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4459.72s)]
*  And do you want to support me in achieving my dreams? [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4461.72s)]
*  That's like selfishly what I would say. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4464.72s)]
*  And once you have a kid, everything's out the window and it's different stuff. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4466.72s)]
*  But before that, it's this feeling of like, OK, you're going to be my partner. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4469.72s)]
*  Do you really ride from it? [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4472.72s)]
*  Oh shit, you're really supportive. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4473.72s)]
*  You see all these things going on. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4474.72s)]
*  You know I'm having a hard time with this and you're trying to make it as easy as possible. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4475.72s)]
*  That's huge. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4478.72s)]
*  That's exactly the clip. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4479.72s)]
*  That's exactly what she wants to. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4480.72s)]
*  And the sticky note is just like, or a playlist. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4482.72s)]
*  Like it's just a little action that shows, hey, I got you. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4484.72s)]
*  Hey, I'm thinking about you. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4487.72s)]
*  It seems like not having those creates resentment. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4488.72s)]
*  Where if my, where I don't know if a woman didn't cook her clean, if we would resent her for it. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4492.72s)]
*  I don't know if it would like, it would be this like uproar on a pod if that clip came out. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4498.72s)]
*  We were describing that scenario. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4503.72s)]
*  But you didn't have like clean socks and underwear. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4504.72s)]
*  How would you feel? [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4507.72s)]
*  But this is the thing where I'm just like, I can outsource that to somebody who could make your life easier. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4508.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4513.72s)]
*  Like, so I'm just telling you like where our baselines are. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4514.72s)]
*  And I feel like our baselines are a little off and it seems like you guys need a little bit more thoughtfulness than we think you need. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4516.72s)]
*  Yes. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4522.72s)]
*  For you to not resent us because we don't want to be resented. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4523.72s)]
*  That's huge. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4525.72s)]
*  Because in our minds, a lot of us, we feel like we're going above and beyond. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4526.72s)]
*  So when you get resentment and you think you're going above and beyond, it creates a real friction. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4530.72s)]
*  You're resenting. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4534.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4535.72s)]
*  Why do you resent? [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4536.72s)]
*  Like I do all that. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4537.72s)]
*  Like we think we're doing all this where your baseline is actually higher than what we expect of ourselves. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4538.72s)]
*  I think that's exactly it. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4542.72s)]
*  But our baseline for you is lower. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4543.72s)]
*  Than what you think. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4544.72s)]
*  So you're doing. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4545.72s)]
*  No, it's hard to keep your weight the same and stay shamed. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4546.72s)]
*  No, no, no, listen, listen, listen, listen. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4548.72s)]
*  All that stuff is hard. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4549.72s)]
*  No, listen, because your baseline isn't based on us. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4550.72s)]
*  Like you said earlier, it's based on your mom. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4553.72s)]
*  So you're putting your mom's shit on me. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4556.72s)]
*  I'm not your mom. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4559.72s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4561.72s)]
*  Like I don't care what your mom said. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4562.72s)]
*  So I think we need to find that. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4563.72s)]
*  Like I think we need to work on finding what that baseline is and work on. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4565.72s)]
*  Okay, wow, you went above and beyond and this was really extra. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4569.72s)]
*  You might like fold all the socks and shit. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4573.72s)]
*  I don't care if they're folded or not. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4575.72s)]
*  I don't care if they're mixed. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4576.72s)]
*  I don't care if they're inside out or not. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4577.72s)]
*  You might be looking at me like, no, that's inside out. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4579.72s)]
*  I did all of this for you. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4581.72s)]
*  Yeah, I never looked at my underwear. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4582.72s)]
*  Could be less of a problem. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4584.72s)]
*  I think the solution for this, nobody wants the resentment. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4585.72s)]
*  And I think women are confused when they open their mouth and everything is nagging. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4589.72s)]
*  I think it's a bad point to get to. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4593.72s)]
*  I think women should be more comfortable being single and like not take out that mom or societal pressure on their partner. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4595.72s)]
*  You guys need to write it down. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4602.72s)]
*  We need the expectations. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4603.72s)]
*  It's also fair. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4605.72s)]
*  When we move in together, we're expecting we're doing all the cleaning because we want it to be clean. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4606.72s)]
*  Not for them. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4615.72s)]
*  They don't give a fuck if it's clean. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4616.72s)]
*  Zach didn't have garbage in his bathroom until I moved in. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4618.72s)]
*  He would use his washing machine as the hamper. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4622.72s)]
*  Like his socks would go from the thing into the drawer with not one thing folded. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4626.72s)]
*  You act like you're doing it for us. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4630.72s)]
*  For us. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4631.72s)]
*  I'm doing it for myself, not for him. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4632.72s)]
*  He doesn't give a fuck. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4634.72s)]
*  So that cleaning thing is on me, not him. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4635.72s)]
*  Because I want the house to be that way. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4638.72s)]
*  She's like, I didn't touch it today. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4640.72s)]
*  I go, who cares? [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4642.72s)]
*  I just did the compliments. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4643.72s)]
*  That's good. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4645.72s)]
*  Alicia wasn't around. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4647.72s)]
*  Mark didn't have a toothbrush for three days. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4649.72s)]
*  Two days, okay? [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4650.72s)]
*  We were shooting a thing. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4651.72s)]
*  I got one. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4652.72s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4653.72s)]
*  That's disgusting. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4654.72s)]
*  But I think this was a good place to get to. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4657.72s)]
*  What are your expectations, the baseline expectations of us, right? [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4659.72s)]
*  So that we can understand. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4663.72s)]
*  We might look at them and be like, you know, I can't do that consistently. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4664.72s)]
*  It's just really not important to me. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4668.72s)]
*  And I'll do it a little bit so you feel good. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4670.72s)]
*  But know that it is not important to me. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4673.72s)]
*  And the only reason I'm doing it so you feel good. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4675.72s)]
*  That's different than you expect me to do it every single time. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4677.72s)]
*  Because there's going to be resentment because of that gap. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4680.72s)]
*  Yeah, the expectation of mind reading is hard. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4683.72s)]
*  But yeah, but like even mind reading, I feel like is part of all this. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4685.72s)]
*  Like to get to the point where she's upset that you didn't read her mind. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4688.72s)]
*  She was upset about 10 things before that. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4691.72s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4693.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4694.72s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4695.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4696.72s)]
*  So I just learned something. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4697.72s)]
*  Yeah, she had no motherfucking idea. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4698.72s)]
*  You're so right. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4700.72s)]
*  I had no motherfucking idea. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4701.72s)]
*  You needed a man to explain it. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4703.72s)]
*  Finally I'm listening. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4704.72s)]
*  It works. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4705.72s)]
*  Finally I'm listening. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4706.72s)]
*  We need to know what you guys baseline expect from us. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4707.72s)]
*  And right now it's more than we thought that you do. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4709.72s)]
*  And you need to know that what we baseline expect from you is less than what your mom says you should have. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4712.72s)]
*  Bare minimum. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4717.72s)]
*  For real. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4718.72s)]
*  It's so easy. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4719.72s)]
*  Honestly, men are so easy. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4720.72s)]
*  Bare minimum. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4721.72s)]
*  Can you fucking talk in a guy's voice? [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4722.72s)]
*  Men are easy. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4725.72s)]
*  It's like they want the most basic primal things in life. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4726.72s)]
*  And it hasn't changed in thousands of years. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4729.72s)]
*  They want you to look good. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4732.72s)]
*  They want good sex. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4734.72s)]
*  And they want to be fed. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4735.72s)]
*  And they want fucking attention. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4736.72s)]
*  Yes, we do love that. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4737.72s)]
*  They want constant love and affection and attention. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4738.72s)]
*  And wait, listen, that's really it. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4740.72s)]
*  Those little things on top are all extra that we think we have to do. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4742.72s)]
*  But they don't really give a fuck about those little things. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4746.72s)]
*  None of that means anything. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4748.72s)]
*  And peace at home. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4749.72s)]
*  They're simple. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4750.72s)]
*  Peace. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4751.72s)]
*  Peace. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4752.72s)]
*  Peace and quiet. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4753.72s)]
*  Peace. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4754.72s)]
*  No, not you. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=4755.72s)]

*  It's called India's Got Latent. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5072.72s)]
*  Latent doesn't matter. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5074.72s)]
*  It's just like a play on the word talent. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5075.72s)]
*  But the idea is it's not just comedy. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5076.72s)]
*  You as a contestant come up. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5079.72s)]
*  You do a talent. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5081.72s)]
*  Before you do the talent, you rate you give yourself what score you think you'll get on [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5083.72s)]
*  a one to ten. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5087.72s)]
*  So if you are self-aware and you're like, I'm a four and we didn't like your act and [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5088.72s)]
*  we give you a four, even if we thought you're a piece of shit and that's why we gave you [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5092.72s)]
*  a four, you could still win because your score is not about who's the best. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5095.72s)]
*  It's about who's got the most self-awareness. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5098.72s)]
*  It's really clever concept. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5100.72s)]
*  I just want to point out one thing. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5101.72s)]
*  That's dope. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5103.72s)]
*  Tony, before you get upset that somebody has taken your show, I just want to point something [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5104.72s)]
*  out. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5109.72s)]
*  This is very serious right here. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5110.72s)]
*  India has taken Superman, Batman, every Marvel movie, every huge billion dollar blockbuster [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5112.72s)]
*  movie they've made into Bollywood. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5122.72s)]
*  And now they're doing with Kill Tony. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5124.72s)]
*  That is like he's a fan and he gives Tony credit. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5125.72s)]
*  But that's the ultimate sign of respect. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5127.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5129.72s)]
*  Where an Indian cultural institution has taken your concept and ran with it. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5130.72s)]
*  My understanding is he's truly like, I can't, these people can't make it to India to do [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5135.72s)]
*  Kill Tony. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5138.72s)]
*  Let's bring Kill Tony over here. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5139.72s)]
*  I mean, I think the show, it goes bonkers. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5140.72s)]
*  I'm talking like it's India, but like it makes like $3,000 a year. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5142.72s)]
*  You deserve royalties. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5147.72s)]
*  Not dollars, but views 20 million in F. It's like fucking insanely big. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5149.72s)]
*  It becomes a part of the zeitgeist. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5154.72s)]
*  Like the cultural conversation. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5156.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5158.72s)]
*  Some may becomes this massive star. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5159.72s)]
*  He was already a good comic respected, but now he's out of here. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5160.72s)]
*  One episode they're doing, and just like Kill Tony, he's got his guests who are celebrities. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5164.72s)]
*  One episode they're doing Run via Alibabi, who's a sweet kid, asks the contestant a hypothetical. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5167.72s)]
*  Hey, would you rather watch your parents have sex forever or join in to make it stop? [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5172.72s)]
*  Seems like a fun hypothetical. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5178.72s)]
*  All of a sudden, there's this massive uproar. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5180.72s)]
*  They're threatened with going to jail, legal issues. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5182.72s)]
*  It's like getting a F.I.R. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5185.72s)]
*  I forget where that stands for, but essentially like we're preparing a legal case against you. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5187.72s)]
*  Run via's parents, like people are. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5192.72s)]
*  So it's not even some some. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5194.72s)]
*  Both are getting threatened, but he didn't say the joke. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5196.72s)]
*  No, run via did. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5199.72s)]
*  And people were at the taping said Run via after he said it, checked in on the guy. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5200.72s)]
*  He's like, hey, that didn't hurt your feelings. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5204.72s)]
*  What an elego, which is like you didn't mind that too much. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5206.72s)]
*  I wasn't too bad for you. Right. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5208.72s)]
*  Checks in again after the episode. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5209.72s)]
*  Hey, you're OK with that. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5210.72s)]
*  The guy's like, yeah, it's all good. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5211.72s)]
*  They keep in the episode. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5212.72s)]
*  Suddenly it just becomes this massive case of how dare you put something that obscene in entertainment. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5213.72s)]
*  India has the most violent fucking movie. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5220.72s)]
*  There's a movie called Animal that came out in twenty twenty three. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5222.72s)]
*  Great movie. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5224.72s)]
*  It's maybe the most violent movie ever seen in my life. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5225.72s)]
*  But they're killing Muslims. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5227.72s)]
*  No, no, no. Other Indians, which is a problem. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5229.72s)]
*  Joking about Muslims probably OK. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5231.72s)]
*  But there's also dude, Indian comics have gone to jail for making jokes about like that are adjacent. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5232.72s)]
*  A Muslim comic going to jail for making jokes like adjacent to Hinduism and not even really. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5239.72s)]
*  So they're going through their comedy struggle, which happens in every country. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5242.72s)]
*  Like this happened in America, too. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5246.72s)]
*  I understand things are going to be inflated there at a different level and there's probably going to be more severe actions taken. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5248.72s)]
*  But like it's it's not to say that this isn't a common occurrence historically. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5253.72s)]
*  Like there are American comedians that got arrested for, you know, what is it, the seven deadly words or whatever it is. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5257.72s)]
*  You can't say on television. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5262.72s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not. I'm not saying it's not potentially way worse there. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5263.72s)]
*  But what I am saying is it is common that as comedy pops up in a country and you start to say things that the the society or culture does not digest with great frequency. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5266.72s)]
*  Yeah. And a lot of those people not really understanding like the intention is to make people laugh. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5277.72s)]
*  There is this knee jerk rebellion. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5282.72s)]
*  This knee jerk reaction is oftentimes negative and punitive. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5284.72s)]
*  There's a lot of people who have no idea what standup is and they're they're getting offended by this. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5287.72s)]
*  But what two things are different. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5291.72s)]
*  I'm sorry. They don't have free speech as like a court. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5292.72s)]
*  That is the second difference. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5295.72s)]
*  First difference is back then they're not going to dox you. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5297.72s)]
*  There's no Internet. You can find out who Lenny Bruce's mom is. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5300.72s)]
*  Ranveer is like people are his mom is a doctor. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5303.72s)]
*  People are pretending to be patients coming in and then like threatening and whatever. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5306.72s)]
*  Second difference is there is not a constitutional right to free speech. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5310.72s)]
*  India's constitution. I'm going to fuck this up a little bit. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5315.72s)]
*  But it's essentially like you have the right to make your speech and they have the right to get offended. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5317.72s)]
*  And then we can kick it up to the legal battle and see what's going to happen. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5321.72s)]
*  It seems like legally they're going to side against the comics and say the reaction toward them is not OK. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5324.72s)]
*  You can't take violent action on your own. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5329.72s)]
*  But these people should be censored. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5331.72s)]
*  So that is where I'm not going to speak ill of the Indian government because I'm terrified of them. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5334.72s)]
*  Whatever they God bless. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5338.72s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5341.72s)]
*  Whatever fear you have about Candice Owens. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5342.72s)]
*  Hundred X. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5343.72s)]
*  So guys, hey, no ill will here. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5344.72s)]
*  That's not enough on you, Candice. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5348.72s)]
*  Listen, we have a lot of fear and we want to make sure that you keep on doing the great work that you're doing about the Bell Donnie case and also about Macron. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5350.72s)]
*  Anyway, back to what I will say. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5357.72s)]
*  Freedom of speech is not a real thing in India. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5358.72s)]
*  They don't. It doesn't exist like that. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5361.72s)]
*  So if you are a comedian, that's a real fucking issue. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5362.72s)]
*  I don't know any solution other than get the fuck out because this they're going to pass a law. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5366.72s)]
*  And I don't know if this is anything I'm not speculating at all. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5371.72s)]
*  But, you know, keep my family safe. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5373.72s)]
*  But they're going to eventually pass a law that is you don't have you don't get to say what you want as a comic. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5376.72s)]
*  We get to dictate what you what was the answer to the hypothetical. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5380.72s)]
*  I don't remember, but I think we have the same answer. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5384.72s)]
*  You get back in there, right? You were in there once. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5386.72s)]
*  You go home. You go home. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5390.72s)]
*  You go home. You end it. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5392.72s)]
*  And then you're going to watch them forever. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5394.72s)]
*  I think you get desensitized. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5396.72s)]
*  I'm yes. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5397.72s)]
*  I didn't say about that. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5399.72s)]
*  That movie game. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5401.72s)]
*  Come on. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5403.72s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5405.72s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5406.72s)]
*  Watch it forever. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5407.72s)]
*  Does that mean like every night that you go home, they're doing it or do you have to sit in the room forever? [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5408.72s)]
*  Because I couldn't sit in the room forever. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5412.72s)]
*  It's not fair. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5413.72s)]
*  You got to watch it once a day for the rest of your life. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5414.72s)]
*  Now we could do that. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5416.72s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5417.72s)]
*  That's it to me. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5419.72s)]
*  The best or worst part of that, but that will be all the same answer. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5420.72s)]
*  Plus, my dad got a bigger dick than me and shit like, come on, I can't get involved. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5422.72s)]
*  Yeah, you got to watch your dad. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5426.72s)]
*  You worried about not pleasing your mom. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5429.72s)]
*  Disappoint your parents again. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5434.72s)]
*  I know. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5435.72s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5436.72s)]
*  Oh, that's so funny. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5437.72s)]
*  It's funny to me. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5439.72s)]
*  We hear this on fucking public radio in America and there it's unbelievable. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5440.72s)]
*  How could you? [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5444.72s)]
*  So they're taking it seriously. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5445.72s)]
*  They're taking the hypothetical 100% seriously. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5446.72s)]
*  They're not seeing that both situations are awful and vulgar and obscene. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5448.72s)]
*  And the reaction they have is right. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5452.72s)]
*  Like, yes, it's awful, vulgar and obscene. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5453.72s)]
*  That's why I'm asking it. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5455.72s)]
*  Because you have to choose between these two things that are horrendous and you wouldn't want to do either one of them. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5456.72s)]
*  It seems like the Indian free speech law in the Constitution imposes restrictions on certain things like defamation, security of state. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5461.72s)]
*  But also decency and morality. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5468.72s)]
*  So now you have like morality police basically saying, hey, this violates the Indian law. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5470.72s)]
*  So, yeah, to be honest, any law the government passes is not unconstitutional, whereas here it would be unconstitutional. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5475.72s)]
*  It is a direct violation of the Constitution that is freedom of speech. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5481.72s)]
*  It's pretty absolute. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5484.72s)]
*  There it's not absolute. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5485.72s)]
*  So if the government passes a law, it's on you all for voting for it. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5486.72s)]
*  Like there's the government didn't do anything. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5491.72s)]
*  The government didn't do anything. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5492.72s)]
*  This is the perfect thing for them to step in on because there are very few people that are not comedy fans that would be supporting questions like, would you fuck your mom so that your dad would stop fucking her every day in front of you? [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5493.72s)]
*  Yeah, like they'd be like, we don't need this. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5505.72s)]
*  They don't realize the trickle down effect of that. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5507.72s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5509.72s)]
*  So it's a very easy thing to get on board with if you're not a comedy fan. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5510.72s)]
*  It's designed kind of brilliantly by the government, if you think about it, because I'm sure there's been plenty of other jokes that have caused an uproar. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5514.72s)]
*  I mean, you've told me this before. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5521.72s)]
*  There have been comedians that got in trouble. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5522.72s)]
*  Even Veer when he came on here, didn't he get in trouble with something? [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5524.72s)]
*  He wrote a thing called Two Indias. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5526.72s)]
*  It's like more serious, but he got in trouble for that. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5528.72s)]
*  He got the FIRs thrown at him to threaten him with legal action. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5530.72s)]
*  And when people ask you, Indians ask, why don't you do a tour here? [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5533.72s)]
*  I hate that because I feel like I'm letting them down. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5536.72s)]
*  But like, it ain't worth it. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5538.72s)]
*  The risk reward is just not in my favor. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5539.72s)]
*  So no, I'll do a pop-up show. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5541.72s)]
*  Maybe like pop into a spot even. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5543.72s)]
*  But I'm not, I don't want people there policing and looking for whatever. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5546.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5549.72s)]
*  But the concern is not your life. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5550.72s)]
*  The concern is your family's life. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5552.72s)]
*  Because you could do a show and then it's going to be like an international dust-up. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5554.72s)]
*  But they're not going to arrest an American comedian that's going over there. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5558.72s)]
*  It's going to make them look bad. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5562.72s)]
*  Now Trump gets involved. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5563.72s)]
*  You know him. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5565.72s)]
*  That's the homie. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5566.72s)]
*  He's been on the pot. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5567.72s)]
*  So Trump's not going to let an American doing something that is core to our values. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5568.72s)]
*  Go over there, get arrested and get locked up. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5574.72s)]
*  But he can't protect your cousins, your uncles and all these other people. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5576.72s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5580.72s)]
*  Oh man. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5581.72s)]
*  They kicked Vivek out of there pretty quick. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5582.72s)]
*  I don't know how much they come into his defense. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5584.72s)]
*  That's a good ass point, bro. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5586.72s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5588.72s)]
*  Is he American? [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5590.72s)]
*  If it's America versus India, we'll win. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5591.72s)]
*  I'm American to Indians. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5593.72s)]
*  And I'm American to them. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5595.72s)]
*  And I'm American to them if India's got a problem with me. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5598.72s)]
*  Then I'm American to Americans. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5601.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5603.72s)]
*  It's been interesting to see the international reaction to Trump though. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5604.72s)]
*  Like Trump has all these international fans. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5608.72s)]
*  And I wonder if like some of the things that they believe that he's fighting against here, [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5610.72s)]
*  they hope that their government officials would fight against. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5615.72s)]
*  Like corruption is not a thing unique to America in any way. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5619.72s)]
*  Institutional distrust is not unique to America. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5623.72s)]
*  So when you brand around this idea of like, hey, we're taking down these corrupt institutions. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5626.72s)]
*  You know, we're taking down these corrupt politicians. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5632.72s)]
*  We're draining the swamp. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5634.72s)]
*  Like shit, every country out there is like, yeah, why don't you drain this swamp? [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5636.72s)]
*  That's the reason I'm broke because that swamp is so fucking big. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5639.72s)]
*  So, bro, speaking of Trump and India, did you see him talk to Mr. Forell? [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5642.72s)]
*  This shit was so good, bro. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5645.72s)]
*  This is one of the all time. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5646.72s)]
*  This shit is so good. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5647.72s)]
*  He's just a clip machine. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5648.72s)]
*  I never related to him. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5649.72s)]
*  Do you think that should continue here in the US as well? [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5650.72s)]
*  You're going to have to go louder. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5652.72s)]
*  Mr. President, people in India would be welcoming your decision to extradite the HUB or RANA to India. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5654.72s)]
*  I can't understand the word he said. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5659.72s)]
*  You see, it's not just me. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5661.72s)]
*  So I had trouble understanding that. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5663.72s)]
*  So this is an interesting, I want to get back to the side. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5665.72s)]
*  It's an interesting thing that I've noticed with Trump is like, people always say this, especially liberals often say this. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5668.72s)]
*  They're like, why the fuck do working class people relate to this guy? [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5676.72s)]
*  He's a billionaire. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5681.72s)]
*  And I think an interesting thing with Trump is that billionaires don't really relate to him. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5683.72s)]
*  He talks working class. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5690.72s)]
*  Right? [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5693.72s)]
*  That's a working class thing to say. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5694.72s)]
*  Like a billionaire polished person would be like, would you mind repeating yourself? [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5695.72s)]
*  Because he understands the repercussions of saying some shit like that. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5698.72s)]
*  But a dude that works at the plant and some Indian guy is asking him questions like, yo, can someone translate the English to English? [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5702.72s)]
*  I have no fucking clue what's going on. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5709.72s)]
*  And that relatability allows him to connect to those people, which financially he's not connected with at all. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5711.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5716.72s)]
*  I was talking to the reporter that we had on, was it last week or two weeks ago? [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5717.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5722.72s)]
*  He was here just about that. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5723.72s)]
*  And it was like, we had that conversation about like, why can, like, what is the fundamental issue? [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5724.72s)]
*  Like, what is the issue with the Democrats? [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5729.72s)]
*  And we were talking about in the hallway and it was like, Republicans and not all of them at all. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5731.72s)]
*  But like Trump feels like he can hang. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5737.72s)]
*  He feels like you could talk to him and you're not like worried about what you say. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5740.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5744.72s)]
*  With Democrats, if it was a private room and nobody's around, then we had fucking Tim Walton here. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5745.72s)]
*  We got fucking Buttigieg or some like one of these guys like, yeah, we could hang. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5751.72s)]
*  We could say whatever and it doesn't really matter. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5755.72s)]
*  But the second the cameras go on, they're like, if I mentioned the pronouns thing is a little bit absurd, am I going to get blowback? [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5756.72s)]
*  And they don't know where the line is. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5763.72s)]
*  I think, Mark, you said something like that. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5765.72s)]
*  They just don't know where it is. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5767.72s)]
*  And when you don't know where the line is, you speak in this like unrelatable way. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5768.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5772.72s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5773.72s)]
*  And that is something that Democrats are going to have to figure out. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5774.72s)]
*  You have to figure out how to just speak freely and relate to normal people. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5777.72s)]
*  And you can't do that when you don't even know where your line is. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5781.72s)]
*  I figure it's just have too many donors that have special interests. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5784.72s)]
*  And it's like, oh, if I see this one thing, I'm going to piss off this donor. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5788.72s)]
*  But I think you catch Republicans with that, especially with like the gun stuff. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5791.72s)]
*  But there's a little bit more like it's going to get obviously too far and be annoying on the Republican side as well. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5796.72s)]
*  But there's a little more freedom to be like, ah, shut up with that kind of nonsense. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5802.72s)]
*  You're being ridiculous. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5805.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5806.72s)]
*  Whereas like Democrats are like, yeah, all right, I'm going to piss off the identity politics people. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5807.72s)]
*  I'm going to piss off these people. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5813.72s)]
*  I'm going to piss off those people. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5814.72s)]
*  You're constantly concerned about the piss off. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5815.72s)]
*  And he doesn't seem that concerned about pissing people off, which is refreshing. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5817.72s)]
*  There's also an easier spot like right wing people in general are able to just be like, hey, let's just go back. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5823.72s)]
*  We're conservative. Let's not change it. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5827.72s)]
*  Whereas liberal people have to be like, all right, what are we changing? [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5829.72s)]
*  What are we pushing forward as policy? [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5831.72s)]
*  What are the new lines? [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5833.72s)]
*  They're literally trying to find new lines so they don't really have a sort of cognitive view of what the lines are. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5834.72s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5839.72s)]
*  Like when your party is wrapped around progress, you have to continue to progress. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5840.72s)]
*  And sometimes you maybe progress too far. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5845.72s)]
*  Like NATO's job is to expand. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5847.72s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5850.72s)]
*  Like if you work in a NATO, they're like, all right, where else can we get NATO? [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5851.72s)]
*  And then maybe you go too far and then maybe there's a war that none of us want to be a part of. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5855.72s)]
*  If the ACLU is like, that shit's pretty good. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5860.72s)]
*  They're done. It's a wrap. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5862.72s)]
*  We don't need you anymore. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5863.72s)]
*  But you do need progressives because you need to get to a point where they're not fucking light and gay people on fire. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5864.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5870.72s)]
*  So it's that unfortunate pendulum swing. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5871.72s)]
*  And they need to find a way to be progressive without alienating the majority because I feel like in their efforts to embrace minorities and embrace the people who don't really have a voice, they've kind of alienated the working class, which is the majority of people in the country. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5874.72s)]
*  So they need to figure that shit out. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5891.72s)]
*  And that shit ain't easy. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5892.72s)]
*  It's not as easy as going and get the pronouns out of here. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5894.72s)]
*  Like, that's a tough... [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5896.72s)]
*  It's the class issue that they're like tiptoeing around. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5898.72s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5900.72s)]
*  I don't want to acknowledge the class issue and try to go with billionaires the way Bernie did. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5901.72s)]
*  Oh, because they're in bed with the billionaires. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5905.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5907.72s)]
*  Or with the Democrats or the Republicans? [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5908.72s)]
*  Democrats. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5909.72s)]
*  I mean, kind of everyone. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5910.72s)]
*  Democrats in America are kind of right in comparison to the rest of the world. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5911.72s)]
*  So they're tiptoeing around the class issue and going at all the pop culture shit. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5915.72s)]
*  Republicans being in bed with billionaires doesn't surprise us. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5920.72s)]
*  It's in line with lower taxes. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5923.72s)]
*  They're the party for the rich. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5925.72s)]
*  But that is a great point. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5926.72s)]
*  If they made their cause about the wealth gap and then let all the other stuff kind of go to the side, [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5927.72s)]
*  I'm not saying we just fucking ignore what gay people or whatever. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5934.72s)]
*  I'm not saying ignore. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5938.72s)]
*  But if they made the core identity of it, Bernie, which was, hey, you got these institutions that are taking advantage of you [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5939.72s)]
*  and you got these rich people that are taking advantage of you. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5944.72s)]
*  I think that the average working class person could kind of look the other way about some pronoun shit. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5947.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5952.72s)]
*  You know? [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5953.72s)]
*  But because, like you said, they're afraid to address it, they got to lock into these other things that, [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5954.72s)]
*  unfortunately for those people, the rest of America really doesn't care about at the same level that they care about the wealth inequality. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5959.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5965.72s)]
*  I mean, frankly, it's a big issue that affects more people. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5966.72s)]
*  It is. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5968.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5969.72s)]
*  And Republicans are the party of the rich. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5970.72s)]
*  And a lot of them think, oh, I'm going to be rich too one day. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5972.72s)]
*  That's America. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5974.72s)]
*  Every American think they're going to be a millionaire. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5975.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5976.72s)]
*  OK. So then what happens in India? [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5977.72s)]
*  What happens with these guys? [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5978.72s)]
*  So they've already taken down all the episodes. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5979.72s)]
*  That show is off the air. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5982.72s)]
*  It's not. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5983.72s)]
*  I tried to look up how many views there were. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5984.72s)]
*  They took it down or the government took it down? [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5985.72s)]
*  I think they were like, the government was like, take down all the episodes and they were like, we will comply. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5986.72s)]
*  I don't know for a fact, but that's it seems like what it is based on reading. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5992.72s)]
*  Like somebody put, sorry, they both apologized. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5995.72s)]
*  I wasn't trying to offend anybody. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5997.72s)]
*  I wasn't whatever. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=5999.72s)]
*  Which was like, again, in America, you don't have to do that. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6000.72s)]
*  I think in India, you have to fucking do that. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6003.72s)]
*  So I don't know. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6005.72s)]
*  I just tweeted it before I even knew what was happening. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6007.72s)]
*  I was like, I don't give a fuck what Runvier said. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6009.72s)]
*  I know him. I like him as family. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6012.72s)]
*  I'm riding with him. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6013.72s)]
*  Then I said something else and somebody was like, somebody should be fined every time they cuss. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6014.72s)]
*  This is up my dick, you dumbass motherfucker, which I thought was a joke. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6018.72s)]
*  These tweets made it to the Times of India because here you can just stand up for those guys. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6021.72s)]
*  There you cannot. Nobody's saying it. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6026.72s)]
*  Oh, your tweets made it. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6027.72s)]
*  My tweets, their whole article. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6028.72s)]
*  Indian comedian who interviewed Trump. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6030.72s)]
*  You need to chill the fuck out. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6032.72s)]
*  But again, I can stand. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6034.72s)]
*  I'm not going to criticize the government. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6036.72s)]
*  I just know I can stand on what comedy is and what free speech is. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6037.72s)]
*  That I'm comfortable. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6041.72s)]
*  I'm confident in that the government theoretically, if they do pass this law, they're not doing anything unconstitutional. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6042.72s)]
*  So as much as I'm afraid of them, I wouldn't even say what you're doing is X, Y, Z, because that is the Constitution. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6048.72s)]
*  They are within their. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6053.72s)]
*  I can't call it some gross misuse of power. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6054.72s)]
*  The Constitution was written. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6056.72s)]
*  It's also fascinating how native freedom of speech is and like expression is in America. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6058.72s)]
*  That like even seeing the response from like Indian like Twitter users being like, oh, this is disgusting. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6062.72s)]
*  Like this dude, this guy is a creep. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6067.72s)]
*  He's issuing this apology. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6068.72s)]
*  He was deliberate act in full consciousness. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6069.72s)]
*  Like, yeah, my marital is legal in India. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6071.72s)]
*  He can't write wife in it. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6074.72s)]
*  Impossible for that to be illegal. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6076.72s)]
*  A hypothetical about fucking somebody. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6078.72s)]
*  Wow. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6080.72s)]
*  That's illegal. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6081.72s)]
*  What is this word? [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6082.72s)]
*  Sanskar. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6083.72s)]
*  Yes, and Scott is, I think, traditions. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6084.72s)]
*  So decency culture and traditions are not his forte. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6086.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6089.72s)]
*  So basically people saying you're violating what it means to be Indian, which is like decency and respect. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6090.72s)]
*  Wow. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6094.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6095.72s)]
*  But then you got to wonder, like, is the way America does shit like freedom of expression in America, is that applicable to all people? [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6096.72s)]
*  Is that inalienable and human or is that just a cultural thing? [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6102.72s)]
*  That's a cultural thing. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6105.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6106.72s)]
*  Like, so at a certain point as Americans, do you look at this and go, oh, if that's what works for them. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6107.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6111.72s)]
*  Or should we stand up for freedom of speech? [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6112.72s)]
*  That is the issue. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6113.72s)]
*  The age old question, man. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6115.72s)]
*  I think we are often I was like freedom of speech under attack in India. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6116.72s)]
*  It doesn't exist. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6120.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6121.72s)]
*  It's such a crazy notion that we are in a country like cancel culture is like people fucking use it to make money, I think, here a lot. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6122.72s)]
*  And it's a little annoying. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6129.72s)]
*  There it is. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6130.72s)]
*  Truly. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6131.72s)]
*  Your life is in jeopardy. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6132.72s)]
*  We'll throw you in jail. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6133.72s)]
*  We'll fuck. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6134.72s)]
*  We'll take everything from everyone you love. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6135.72s)]
*  Don't fuck around. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6136.72s)]
*  Is this one of those things where we're projecting our values in the same way that we're like, yo, you got to let women drive in the Middle East or whatever, just because we let them drive here. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6137.72s)]
*  So now we're projecting our values on them and we believe that free speech is a good, righteous, kind thing that human beings should have. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6146.72s)]
*  And over there, they're like, we have way less accidents. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6154.72s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6156.72s)]
*  But it is the same like, what is it like in intellectual imperialism, if you will, like when I over there boots on the grounds, but we're basically shaming you if you don't get American with your shit. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6157.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6170.72s)]
*  At the same time, as a comedian, I'm like, I want comedians to be able to say way crazier jokes than that. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6171.72s)]
*  I'm going to support every Indian comic saying whatever. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6175.72s)]
*  That's just a fundamental thing for me as an American who is a comic. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6177.72s)]
*  And the government over there is like, that's cute. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6181.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6183.72s)]
*  So that's not the way our Constitution is written. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6184.72s)]
*  So what do you want to do? [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6186.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6187.72s)]
*  Comedy isn't even part of their like identities and nation. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6188.72s)]
*  Like comedy is an American art form. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6191.72s)]
*  I can't imagine America. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6193.72s)]
*  I can't imagine like American cultural institutions without comedy. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6195.72s)]
*  And a restriction on that, we reject almost instinctually. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6199.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, yeah, what's a viscerally? [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6204.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6206.72s)]
*  It makes me sick. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6207.72s)]
*  But this is some new shit over there. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6208.72s)]
*  It's like comedies literally. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6210.72s)]
*  I've done comedy longer than the country of India. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6211.72s)]
*  It started, I think, December 2009. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6213.72s)]
*  They like know exactly when it started. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6215.72s)]
*  It's brand new to them. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6217.72s)]
*  I started 2007. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6218.72s)]
*  I wonder if it's like if if they were like, you know, break dancing is vulgar. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6219.72s)]
*  And we'd be like, what are you talking? [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6224.72s)]
*  It's not. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6226.72s)]
*  It's just dance. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6227.72s)]
*  And they're like, no, we outlawing that shit. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6228.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6229.72s)]
*  You know, like that's how new it is. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6230.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6231.72s)]
*  You know, so they're like, we can do without breakdancing. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6232.72s)]
*  We've been here for 5000 years and there was no fucking breakdancing. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6233.72s)]
*  We'll be fine without it. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6236.72s)]
*  And we're also like taken off guard by this because we're like, there's no way that could happen here. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6237.72s)]
*  There you almost have to wonder, like, did they know? [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6241.72s)]
*  Right. Like, I don't think that's what happened in this case. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6244.72s)]
*  But like, let's say there's a comedian that's warned two times. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6246.72s)]
*  Like, hey, the jokes are saying you're going to get put in jail. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6248.72s)]
*  And then he says it a third time is all of a sudden is our empathy for their restriction of freedom of speech the same? [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6250.72s)]
*  Because it's like, you know, you understood what the consequences. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6256.72s)]
*  This is why, sorry, the other thing people are like, they're making an example of him. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6259.72s)]
*  Maybe they are. I don't know. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6265.72s)]
*  To me, it's weird because if they were doing that, he's been fairly the criticism I hear a lot about Runveer is he's very like the government's whatever. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6266.72s)]
*  Like he does. He's pro-government, pro-whatever. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6275.72s)]
*  Like he's up their ass when people criticize him. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6277.72s)]
*  So for them to make him the example, I'm like, well, that doesn't even add up to me. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6279.72s)]
*  Well, is there any? [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6282.72s)]
*  Could be possible, but it doesn't add up to me. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6283.72s)]
*  Is there any? You said he's the Rogan of India, right? [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6284.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6287.72s)]
*  I think it's a version where they're looking at America and all right, let me let me bring it back. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6288.72s)]
*  You know how like China locked up their tech CEOs? [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6293.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6296.72s)]
*  And I imagine they looked at America and maybe other countries and they saw that the power that these like tech CEOs had and their ability to influence culture laws. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6297.72s)]
*  And they went, you know what? [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6307.72s)]
*  I don't know if we want to. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6309.72s)]
*  I think we need to send a message to these tech CEOs in China that they still work for us. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6310.72s)]
*  And that we make the real decision. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6315.72s)]
*  So you lock them in a basement for a month and then you let them out and then they can continue doing their stuff. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6316.72s)]
*  But now they know if you're saying that he's the Rogan of India, I wonder if this is just a message like, you know, you're not bigger than the system. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6320.72s)]
*  And we're going to let you know right now you're not bigger, even though you've been good, even though you as you're saying the criticism has been up their ass. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6328.72s)]
*  It's just another reminder. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6336.72s)]
*  Whereas with Rogan, you can't do that here. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6337.72s)]
*  Yeah, you can't. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6339.72s)]
*  They tried CNN and tried to like shame him. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6340.72s)]
*  All these different publications try to shame Rogan. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6342.72s)]
*  Like at the end of the day, the American people are going to ride with the guy that they feel is giving them the truth and not the rhetoric. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6344.72s)]
*  And to your point, they could be, and what the theory of conspiracy theorists are saying, whether they're right or wrong, I'm not going to say. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6351.72s)]
*  But conspiracy theorists are saying, well, the law they're trying to pass is about online content and being able to censor that. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6357.72s)]
*  Which would be, to your point, all online content we can't control. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6364.72s)]
*  If I'm another country. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6368.72s)]
*  We can't control. We need to figure that out. Let's pass a law. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6369.72s)]
*  I mean, look, if you... [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6371.72s)]
*  Sorry, theoretically, let's use the guy that's been sympathetic to us so they know like it doesn't seem like a hit piece or doesn't seem like we're making an example of him and sacrificing him, even though we might be. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6372.72s)]
*  Nobody's going to say that because they're going to say, oh, this guy's pro-government. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6381.72s)]
*  So they just really believe in this bill. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6384.72s)]
*  But he's sympathetic now. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6386.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6387.72s)]
*  Like you got to have some control. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6388.72s)]
*  True, true. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6390.72s)]
*  You never know. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6391.72s)]
*  And also, he might be sympathetic to the government, but he might be also sympathetic to the Ambani's or another very powerful family. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6392.72s)]
*  And maybe that's the government going like, hey, we're daddy and you got to abide by this because putting too much power in one person, as you've noticed with in America, like Joe has the influence. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6399.72s)]
*  You know, he can sway elections. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6412.72s)]
*  He can sway culture even before the election. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6414.72s)]
*  He can move culture in a way that will affect the election. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6416.72s)]
*  The election is downstream. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6419.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6420.72s)]
*  So, wow. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6421.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6423.72s)]
*  I wonder what happens in those rooms. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6424.72s)]
*  Like how crazy is it that comedy is at this level where the government needs to potentially step in and apply punitive measures to scare people into relinquishing their power and influence? [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6426.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6439.72s)]
*  That's a crazy. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6440.72s)]
*  What a time to be on comedy. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6441.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6442.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6443.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6444.72s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6445.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6446.72s)]
*  It's a scary thing, man. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6447.72s)]
*  But every institution has a version of that because it's like there's words we don't say on here because we know the platform we put it on. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6448.72s)]
*  Even though we want to say the joke, we won't do it because we know we can potentially get kicked out. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6452.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6457.72s)]
*  Or we bleep it. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6458.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6459.72s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6460.72s)]
*  That's a really good point. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6461.72s)]
*  That's not legal. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6462.72s)]
*  It's not the government coming down here. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6463.72s)]
*  That's true. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6464.72s)]
*  But Google, you know, government has their hand. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6465.72s)]
*  Sure. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6467.72s)]
*  It's like, you know, what's allowed. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6468.72s)]
*  And we don't like these words being said. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6469.72s)]
*  I can see that happening. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6470.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6471.72s)]
*  I just think the leash is a lot shorter over there. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6472.72s)]
*  And I just, I have to ride for comedy and the ability to do comedy. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6474.72s)]
*  Otherwise, it's going to be telling every comic in India, well, you just need to leave and get a fucking seek asylum. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6477.72s)]
*  Get a visa. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6482.72s)]
*  Go to what you love somewhere else. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6483.72s)]
*  So where is Sameh? [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6485.72s)]
*  Why don't we get him on the pod? [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6486.72s)]
*  I would love to try to. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6487.72s)]
*  He's actually, I was trying to get him. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6488.72s)]
*  He's doing shows in Canada right now. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6490.72s)]
*  I talked to him. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6492.72s)]
*  He's holding up. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6493.72s)]
*  Okay. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6494.72s)]
*  But he's like a single entry visa. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6495.72s)]
*  So we got to be able to figure out how to get him back here. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6497.72s)]
*  But I would love to have him on. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6498.72s)]
*  I don't know what he's going to be willing to say, but I would love to talk to him. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6499.72s)]
*  I would love to, because I'm safe in America, I would love to bring light to this issue. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6502.72s)]
*  I can understand why bigger comics in India are staying silent, but me in America, without trying to make too many enemies, I would like to have some conversation. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6506.72s)]
*  And maybe he's just asking a bunch of hypotheticals and, you know, having fun and he can't answer them. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6513.72s)]
*  And that's kind of fun. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6517.72s)]
*  That's the tricky thing when it starts to affect your family. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6518.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6522.72s)]
*  Like most of us are willing to take it on. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6523.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6525.72s)]
*  You take on the criticism. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6526.72s)]
*  And in America is different. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6527.72s)]
*  It's online criticism, people making comments or saying stupid shit. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6528.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6531.72s)]
*  It's like they're saying death threats, but it's like, okay, whatever. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6532.72s)]
*  But when they pull up to your mom's job. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6535.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6538.72s)]
*  You're not worried about that? [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6539.72s)]
*  Like your tweets are getting picked up in the Times over there. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6540.72s)]
*  You have family back there. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6542.72s)]
*  You know how many Singhs there are? [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6543.72s)]
*  That's true. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6544.72s)]
*  I mean. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6545.72s)]
*  That's true. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6546.72s)]
*  And they'll probably think I'm Punjabi. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6547.72s)]
*  They can tell them apart. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6548.72s)]
*  No, they can't. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6549.72s)]
*  They all think I'm Punjabi. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6550.72s)]
*  Let them. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6551.72s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6552.72s)]
*  But yeah, I guess to me, it's like, it's not anti-government. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6553.72s)]
*  What I'm saying is just pro being able to make jokes. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6556.72s)]
*  And I guess to me, I hope that people can make that distinction of like, I'm going to defend comedy. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6560.72s)]
*  I'm a comic. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6565.72s)]
*  Unequivocally, this is what I will do. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6566.72s)]
*  I don't know that they will, but like, I'm not going at the government. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6567.72s)]
*  I would never do something that fucking crazy. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6570.72s)]
*  I mean, I fear them. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6572.72s)]
*  So there you go. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6573.72s)]
*  That's on record. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6574.72s)]
*  Everybody, government. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6575.72s)]
*  I'm afraid of you. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6576.72s)]
*  I want no smoke. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6577.72s)]
*  It was like, I remember when we were in Russia and there was like part of me that was like really enticed by like doing. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6579.72s)]
*  I don't have family in Russia, so it's fine. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6586.72s)]
*  And I'm like, what's the international incident that's going to come from that? [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6588.72s)]
*  It's not going to be a fucking I'm no bargaining chip or whatever. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6591.72s)]
*  But at least it's in your brain. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6593.72s)]
*  And it feels a little bit more exciting because the stakes are higher. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6595.72s)]
*  You know, any joke feels more exciting. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6601.72s)]
*  Even when we're in the Middle East, like doing those jokes felt a little bit more exciting because of the cost. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6603.72s)]
*  But at the end of the day, I get to go. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6612.72s)]
*  Yeah, all my family's. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6614.72s)]
*  I don't have any family in Russia. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6615.72s)]
*  I have no family in the Middle East. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6616.72s)]
*  Like, I'm not concerned about anything happening to them. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6617.72s)]
*  And the worst thing that happens is like I get arrested and then it's this international news story and then I get to come back home. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6619.72s)]
*  Like, that's the worst thing that's going to happen. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6625.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6627.72s)]
*  You know? [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6628.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6629.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6630.72s)]
*  The family thing is crazy. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6631.72s)]
*  I mean, this is like what North Korea has on all their people. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6632.72s)]
*  You know, it's like, you know, you can try to run, but like we know where your dad works. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6634.72s)]
*  You know where your cousin is like. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6637.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6639.72s)]
*  So you can be a martyr, but you want your whole family to be martyrs. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6641.72s)]
*  I actually had Indian comics said that to me. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6644.72s)]
*  His wife was getting sued. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6646.72s)]
*  He was getting sued. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6647.72s)]
*  I don't say it was just because it's not worth it probably, but he was like, they didn't sign up for this. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6648.72s)]
*  That's the thing that fucks me up. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6653.72s)]
*  And that's he's like, I'm probably going to leave because I understood what I was signing up for. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6654.72s)]
*  They didn't. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6658.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6659.72s)]
*  This person just fell in love with me. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6660.72s)]
*  That's their crime. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6661.72s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6662.72s)]
*  I can't do that. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6663.72s)]
*  Yeah, that sucks. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6664.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6665.72s)]
*  Yeah, it sucks. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6666.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6667.72s)]
*  Somebody would love to have you on, dude. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6668.72s)]
*  We'll try to figure it out. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6670.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6671.72s)]
*  As long as you're alive, because they kill Indians in Canada. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6672.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6674.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6675.72s)]
*  The government will send you over. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6676.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6677.72s)]
*  They'll send like a hitman out after them. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6678.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6680.72s)]
*  It's true. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6681.72s)]
*  Imagine he got killed because of your tweets. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6682.72s)]
*  I made him immortal. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6684.72s)]
*  I made him immortal. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6687.72s)]
*  Actually, no, he'll come back. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6688.72s)]
*  That's the other thing. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6690.72s)]
*  Like, why are you stressing so much about your mom getting killed? [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6691.72s)]
*  That's true. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6694.72s)]
*  Do you believe it or not? [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6695.72s)]
*  I mean, I lose her this lifetime. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6696.72s)]
*  I'm not worried about her soul. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6698.72s)]
*  I'm not worried about her soul. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6699.72s)]
*  I'm selfishly like, I'm a minister. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6700.72s)]
*  But I'm also like, if you're the government, if you're like killing... [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6702.72s)]
*  Somebody ain't married. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6705.72s)]
*  He could go. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6706.72s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6707.72s)]
*  Who cares? [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6708.72s)]
*  I'm saying like, if you're the government just killing somebody, you know that they're [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6709.72s)]
*  going to come back as like a fish or whatever. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6713.72s)]
*  Like, they'll do something. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6715.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6717.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6718.72s)]
*  So it's really not a good punishment. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6719.72s)]
*  Keeping them alive and making them watch their parents have sex every single day. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6720.72s)]
*  For a dead person. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6723.72s)]
*  That seems like a way better punishment. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6724.72s)]
*  That is a fair law. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6725.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6726.72s)]
*  Yeah, you got to deal with whatever your words were. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6727.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6729.72s)]
*  That's funny. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6730.72s)]
*  Did any of you all watch the sad ass NBA All-Star game or weekend? [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6731.72s)]
*  I didn't even... [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6736.72s)]
*  This is... [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6737.72s)]
*  I think the NBA is in trouble. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6738.72s)]
*  I didn't even know it was All-Star weekend. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6739.72s)]
*  I forgot. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6741.72s)]
*  Completely forgot until I checked Twitter. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6742.72s)]
*  It was apparently horrible. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6744.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6745.72s)]
*  I tried to tune in Sunday. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6746.72s)]
*  It was really... [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6747.72s)]
*  So what was the format? [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6748.72s)]
*  It was... [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6749.72s)]
*  My understanding is it was instead of two teams, East and West, it was four teams and then [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6750.72s)]
*  a tournament. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6754.72s)]
*  One of the teams is the Rising Stars and then the other ones, Chuck, Shaq and Kenny picked [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6755.72s)]
*  their own teams and then they played. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6761.04s)]
*  Yeah, it was like the OGs, so the older All-Stars, then the younger All-Stars, then the Rising [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6762.72s)]
*  Stars and then there's like the foreigner team. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6767.8s)]
*  So they put like all the Joker bitches and all that type of shit on. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6770.84s)]
*  And then it was just first the 40 and then... [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6773.72s)]
*  And then they put... [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6776.12s)]
*  Then the H1B Visa team. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6777.12s)]
*  That's far. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6778.12s)]
*  Why was the All-Star game exciting when we were younger? [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6779.12s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6781.84s)]
*  And here's another question. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6783.320000000001s)]
*  Was it? [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6784.68s)]
*  I remember watching in 2001 and I remember it was kind of boring at first and they said [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6786.320000000001s)]
*  these guys are going to start trying in the fourth quarter and it was awesome in the fourth [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6790.360000000001s)]
*  quarter. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6793.16s)]
*  When they really started trying and I don't remember them ever trying since then. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6794.16s)]
*  Jordan and Kobe in 2003. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6798.6s)]
*  I remember that. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6801.04s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think they were getting paid enough money. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6802.04s)]
*  I mean, now you're getting paid so much money, you're like, I'm not going to risk getting [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6803.52s)]
*  injured for nothing. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6806.360000000001s)]
*  That's a great point. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6807.360000000001s)]
*  It's an inconvenience. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6808.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6809.360000000001s)]
*  Back then, you're like, I'm playing for honor. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6810.360000000001s)]
*  I'm Kobe. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6811.84s)]
*  I'm going to show everyone I'm Mamba. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6812.84s)]
*  And so he like would go off. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6814.4s)]
*  And they would really showboat for the first three quarters and then the last one they're [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6816.12s)]
*  playing. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6819.799999999999s)]
*  And now it feels like they don't even care? [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6820.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's like no defense, slow lobs. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6821.799999999999s)]
*  It's like, it's like shit. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6824.679999999999s)]
*  I used to be more excited for that than Super Bowl Sunday. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6826.36s)]
*  And then LeBron fucked up the dunk contest because the years that we wanted him in it, [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6829.599999999999s)]
*  he's like, nah, it's too risky for my body. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6836.24s)]
*  So then all superstars stopped doing the dunk contest. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6838.36s)]
*  And now we got a white guy winning. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6840.5599999999995s)]
*  Backward Clunks fire though. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6843.36s)]
*  No, he is fire. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6844.36s)]
*  Shout out Mac. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6845.36s)]
*  But like, that is a tricky thing. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6846.36s)]
*  So the superstars stopped doing the dunk contest. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6848.48s)]
*  So now we have less interest in that. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6851.4s)]
*  The superstars aren't even playing their hardest and some of them don't even play. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6854.88s)]
*  LeBron tapped out like an hour or two before. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6859.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6862.5199999999995s)]
*  Which Stephen A called out and I love LeBron, but I agree with Stephen A here. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6863.5199999999995s)]
*  You could have just not played and given someone else a spot. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6866.799999999999s)]
*  Why would you wait so long? [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6871.32s)]
*  Play or don't. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6872.84s)]
*  Yeah, but he wants that little byline. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6873.84s)]
*  This is 20 time All-Star. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6875.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6877.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6878.84s)]
*  So how do they... [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6879.84s)]
*  Also, what would you do if you're advising like Wemby or you're advising... [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6880.84s)]
*  Don't play hard. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6883.64s)]
*  Yeah, right? [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6884.64s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6885.64s)]
*  I have a contract that is guaranteeing you $350 million. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6886.64s)]
*  I don't want you playing in a... [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6890.2s)]
*  I don't let you play back to backs. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6891.84s)]
*  You're not allowed to go skiing. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6893.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6894.400000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6895.400000000001s)]
*  Like, I'm not going to let you play basketball hard for nothing. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6896.400000000001s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6898.6s)]
*  No benefit to my team at all. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6899.84s)]
*  Yeah, they're in a tricky situation. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6902.2s)]
*  I mean, you saw it happen with the NFL All-Star game. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6903.72s)]
*  That shit is flag football. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6906.68s)]
*  I didn't know they did that. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6908.48s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6909.48s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't know they did that. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6911.68s)]
*  It's trash. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6912.68s)]
*  Nobody watches it. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6913.68s)]
*  Actually, it would still get big ratings, which is crazy. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6914.68s)]
*  Really? [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6915.68s)]
*  That makes no sense. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6916.68s)]
*  It would still get bigger ratings than every other sport. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6917.68s)]
*  I thought it was such a problem that they had to move it to the week after or something [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6919.6s)]
*  like that. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6924.16s)]
*  They did that in the week between the Super Bowls, between the championship and the Super [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6925.16s)]
*  Bowl. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6926.92s)]
*  The ratings weren't great relative to NFL games, but they were still shockingly high [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6927.92s)]
*  relative to how they're supporting it. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6931.6s)]
*  It's fair enough. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6932.6s)]
*  I like the celebrity game. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6933.6s)]
*  It was embarrassing. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6934.6s)]
*  Celebrity game more than anything, because I'm like, I got to see Kevin Hart play. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6935.6s)]
*  Because you're trying. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6937.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they're trying. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6938.400000000001s)]
*  They have a little ego about it. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6939.400000000001s)]
*  And you get to see people play that you would never imagine playing. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6941.6s)]
*  They tried to change it by making it like first to an X amount of points, because then [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6945.240000000001s)]
*  there's a cap and people start to play defense to be like, well, you're not going to get [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6948.6s)]
*  closer than me to the... [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6952.04s)]
*  They were attempting to make the game more competitive. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6953.58s)]
*  All right, I got you. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6955.4400000000005s)]
*  Which it was. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6956.4400000000005s)]
*  It was a little bit. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6957.4400000000005s)]
*  I think I could save this shit. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6958.4400000000005s)]
*  For one year, I could save it. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6960.0s)]
*  I don't know if it goes past one year. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6964.04s)]
*  But what do NBA vets, what do like retired NBA players always say? [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6966.12s)]
*  Oh, back in my day with the hand checking rules, whatever, I would have scored 30 if [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6971.639999999999s)]
*  it was like this or I would have done whatever. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6977.0s)]
*  You make the game the current All-Stars versus retired All-Stars. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6979.599999999999s)]
*  Okay? [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6985.5599999999995s)]
*  And you give the retired All-Stars some sort of like cushion, some sort of lead, whatever. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6986.92s)]
*  And now you're playing for pride. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6992.8s)]
*  Now all those guys that were talking all that shit on ESPN all year, how they would lock [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6995.68s)]
*  up Steph or what they would do to this person, what they would do to that. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=6999.28s)]
*  Maybe you even switch it to like the old rules where hand checking is allowed or like you [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=7003.52s)]
*  allow them to play the defense of their time. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=7007.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=7009.32s)]
*  You need to create rivalry that we want to see. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=7010.32s)]
*  I want to see Kendrick Perkins talking all that shit about fucking Wemby and then have [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=7012.400000000001s)]
*  to guard him. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=7015.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=7016.96s)]
*  The problem is they're all so out of shit. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=7017.96s)]
*  Not all. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=7019.4s)]
*  So many of them get so out of shit. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=7020.4s)]
*  But they knew, they knew all you got to do is come up for one game. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=7021.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=7026.12s)]
*  You know, you just need something else. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=7027.12s)]
*  Like make them golf. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=7029.08s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=7140.04s)]

*  the best. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=7145.719999999999s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=7168.64s)]
*  And then with NFL, I think the Pro Bowl, you should put it the week before the season starts. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=7169.64s)]
*  Get like all the best players to start the season off. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=7174.84s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZCj8l64CNU&t=7227.04s)]
