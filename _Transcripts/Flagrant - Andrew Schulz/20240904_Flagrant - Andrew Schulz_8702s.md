*  As soon as he laughed, I knew what was coming. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=114.5s)]
*  Twitter has gotten off of Jews [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=117.0s)]
*  because I don't think there's as many clicks anymore in the Jews. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=119.0s)]
*  Like all the anti-Semitism that could be said. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=121.0s)]
*  We got to the end of racism. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=123.0s)]

*  And now they're on Indians. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=126.0s)]
*  Because Indians keep responding. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=128.0s)]
*  And they just keep rage raiding. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=130.0s)]
*  Indians keep tagging me like, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=133.0s)]

*  So this is the best... [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=146.5s)]
*  Can I tell you the silver lining? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=147.5s)]
*  Because it's becoming so popular to make fun of India, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=148.5s)]
*  I can feel you being like, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=151.5s)]

*  these incels are ruining one of the most beloved exercises [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=162.5s)]
*  which is being racist with friends. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=166.5s)]
*  Anti-Semitism, racism, sexism, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=168.5s)]
*  all these things are things you do [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=170.5s)]

*  got the picket fences out. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=183.5s)]
*  Not picket fence power. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=185.5s)]
*  This damn god made India my personal favorite. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=187.5s)]
*  That one is really good. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=189.5s)]
*  The Indian Navy? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=190.5s)]
*  These are fucked up. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=194.5s)]
*  We gotta say something. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=195.5s)]
*  I don't care, dude. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=197.5s)]
*  You know what, though? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=198.5s)]
*  You go to India, you'll be smelling shit every once in a while. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=199.5s)]
*  You'll be like, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=201.5s)]
*  I love India! [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=203.5s)]
*  It's not the best smelling spot. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=204.5s)]
*  You'll be smelling, it's just rainy spots. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=205.5s)]
*  You'll be like, well this smells, for about ten seconds. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=207.5s)]
*  But the French smelled notoriously bad for years. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=209.5s)]
*  And then they developed perfume to mask that smell. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=213.5s)]
*  Now they still... [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=216.5s)]
*  What do you guys do? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=217.5s)]
*  We're getting there. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=219.5s)]
*  We can smell worse. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=220.5s)]
*  Also the French still smell. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=222.5s)]
*  But we're getting there. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=224.5s)]
*  You're figuring it all out. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=225.5s)]
*  But yeah, it just feels like they're taking away the great joy that we had [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=227.5s)]
*  and calling you guys mud fuckers. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=230.5s)]
*  And it's like, I don't even want to do it anymore. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=231.5s)]
*  Nurds ruin everything. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=234.5s)]
*  We let them get access to social media. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=236.5s)]
*  And they're way better at it than the rest of us. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=238.5s)]
*  So that they can actually put shit out. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=241.5s)]
*  They understand what they're doing. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=243.5s)]
*  They know how to throw the text over the pictures. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=245.5s)]
*  I don't even know how to fucking do that shit. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=247.5s)]
*  I can't make a meme to save my life. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=248.5s)]
*  We're like, I gotta throw it in Instagram. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=250.5s)]

*  That's half of my text message. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=258.5s)]
*  I want them to keep making fun of Indians to the point that you actually defend Indians. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=260.5s)]
*  They don't know how to use it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=263.5s)]

*  That's a suspect. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=555.5s)]
*  But you know what's crazy is that this guy, like, he could probably spin a dreidel better than anybody on planet Earth. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=556.5s)]

*  Anyway, so it's the Jews fall for everything. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=574.5s)]
*  America has no agency in any of the fuck shit we do, which is kind of annoying because like you want to be the ones that bang out. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=576.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=581.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=582.5s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=591.5s)]
*  We can't get credit for anything. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=592.5s)]
*  When we're the fattest is not our fault. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=593.5s)]
*  When everybody's hooked on to pharmaceuticals, it's not our fault. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=595.5s)]
*  It's like a very convenient way to take no accountability. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=598.5s)]
*  We can make drugs. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=600.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=601.5s)]

*  Did they say the Jews did that? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=606.5s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=607.5s)]
*  Wouldn't fit their fucking noses in those helmets. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=608.5s)]

*  Oh, God. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=627.5s)]
*  That could be fun. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=628.5s)]
*  No, we can just try it. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=629.5s)]
*  I've been having fun doing that this whole time. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=630.5s)]

*  Do you think that this is... [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=667.5s)]
*  I think we spoke about this before, but do you think this is just like you get a new [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=668.5s)]
*  car, you got to drive this for a few hours, and then you're like, oh, I'm going to get [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=672.5s)]

*  You get a new car, you got to drive as fast as you can. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=679.5s)]
*  All these people couldn't say shit because they're worried about getting kicked off social [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=682.5s)]
*  media. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=686.5s)]
*  So now they can because Elon is like, yo, you could really say whatever the fuck you [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=687.5s)]
*  want, free speech. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=690.5s)]
*  So now they're like, okay, we're getting out the system. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=691.5s)]
*  And then a year from now, they'll all die down and everybody realizes, yo, it's gay [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=692.5s)]
*  to do this shit. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=696.5s)]

*  This is here to stay? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=699.5s)]
*  This is the platform where they can do it. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=700.5s)]
*  It's one place where they can all go and they can just keep feeding each other. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=701.5s)]
*  It's like the Facebook groups, but for young people. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=705.5s)]
*  We're becoming the old people on Facebook groups that we made fun of. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=707.5s)]
*  We're just doing it on X. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=710.5s)]

*  It's got it, right? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=713.5s)]
*  I think it swings back a little. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=714.5s)]
*  Like people just being like, yo, Hitler was sick. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=715.5s)]
*  I think that'll swing back. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=717.5s)]
*  I think, I don't know if that'll stick around as long. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=718.5s)]
*  I mean, it's nonstop. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=720.5s)]
*  Maybe he was misunderstood. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=721.5s)]
*  He wrote a book. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=723.5s)]
*  He was misunderstood. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=725.5s)]
*  The book said what he wanted to do. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=727.5s)]
*  It's in German, bro. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=729.5s)]
*  It's so hard to fucking understand. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=730.5s)]
*  It's a shitty translation. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=731.5s)]
*  It's like Sanskrit. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=732.5s)]
*  You can't get a good translation. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=733.5s)]
*  You can't get it all. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=735.5s)]
*  I think it's the King James mine. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=736.5s)]
*  That's how it is. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=737.5s)]
*  Ye old Jews. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=738.5s)]
*  I saw one that was, I swear I saw one that was like Hitler with like a little girl and [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=739.5s)]
*  they're like, why don't they show these pictures? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=744.5s)]
*  It's like, you might have walked that bitch to a gas chamber. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=746.5s)]
*  These pictures. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=749.5s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=752.5s)]
*  What is the argument for that? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=753.5s)]
*  Like he was good with kids. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=754.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=756.5s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=757.5s)]
*  John Wayne Gacy was a clown. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=758.5s)]
*  Who gives a fuck? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=760.5s)]
*  Like he probably made a lot of kids happy before he buried him under his house. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=761.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=764.5s)]

*  No, I never thought of that. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=766.5s)]
*  He was misunderstood. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=767.5s)]
*  This whole misunderstanding is working on me. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=768.5s)]
*  He was a clown for kids party specifically. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=773.5s)]
*  I assume. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=775.5s)]
*  The circus motherfuckers. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=776.5s)]
*  Who's that for? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=777.5s)]
*  Who goes to the circus? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=778.5s)]
*  That's true. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=779.5s)]
*  That's true. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=780.5s)]
*  That's not an adult actor. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=781.5s)]
*  What you doing tonight? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=782.5s)]
*  You going to the circus? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=783.5s)]

*  Okay. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=792.5s)]
*  Okay, hold on. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=793.5s)]
*  Because what I'm trying to say is now that we know the clowns are specifically for kids, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=794.5s)]

*  33 young men and boys, 26 of whom were buried in a race. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1124.1s)]
*  And also, and also what age? [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1128.34s)]
*  I mean, the race is more important. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1131.02s)]
*  How many did Dahmer kill? [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1137.4199999999998s)]
*  Now, can we just be honest right here? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1138.86s)]
*  How many black parents are hiring a clown for their kid's birthday party in 1960? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1141.6999999999998s)]
*  If the clown can't crump. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1148.22s)]
*  I don't know almost any of those words you just said. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1152.86s)]
*  That was good. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1155.74s)]

*  What I'm trying to say is what party inspired this? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1167.66s)]
*  Like this guy did this for a living without killing kids for a while. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1169.86s)]
*  And then something happened. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1172.6200000000001s)]
*  Something transpired. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1173.78s)]
*  There was a watershed moment that made him realize that all these kids need to die. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1174.78s)]
*  Rich kid's birthday party for sure. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1178.34s)]
*  Which kid? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1179.78s)]
*  I need to know whose family is responsible. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1180.78s)]
*  I think we know. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1183.78s)]
*  I think there might be a group. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1185.18s)]
*  Let me check Twitter. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1188.22s)]
*  Ask Thumbs. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1189.22s)]
*  Ask Thumbs if he knows. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1190.22s)]
*  Thumbs said it was the Shylocks. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1191.66s)]

*  I think if you put his middle finger up to his thumb it's the exact same. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1200.3799999999999s)]
*  If you straighten it out for sure. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1203.82s)]

*  No, they freeze, those little lizards. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1226.18s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1227.8999999999999s)]
*  You know, remember when we were in Miami? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1228.8999999999999s)]
*  The iguanas. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1229.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, those little iguanas freeze. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1230.8999999999999s)]

*  Let's not go too far. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1233.94s)]
*  He's just a guy who has longer than normal thumbs and hates the Jews a lot. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1234.94s)]
*  Unrelated. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1238.98s)]
*  Completely unrelated. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1239.98s)]
*  You know? [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1241.42s)]
*  Those things have nothing to do with each other. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1242.42s)]
*  I mean, we're going to find a connection, probably by the end of this podcast. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1243.42s)]
*  What connection would exist between a guy with the longest thumbs you've ever seen in [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1247.02s)]
*  your life? [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1250.06s)]
*  I mean, when he's like this, he's fixing his glasses. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1251.06s)]
*  Right? [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1254.82s)]
*  Like, I've never seen, he's slender, right? [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1255.82s)]
*  Something's going on. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1260.3s)]
*  Scissor hands. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1261.3s)]
*  There's a, or maybe that's just peak whiteness. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1262.3s)]
*  Because he's a white, like, the whites are the best guy. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1266.66s)]
*  You know what's annoying by, like, the whites are the best thing? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1271.1s)]
*  Yeah, tell me about it. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1273.3s)]
*  I mean this sincerely. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1275.1s)]

*  All right. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1277.86s)]
*  Like, is it, do you really need to rub it in? [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1278.86s)]
*  Twitter, Twitter, go on this guy. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1282.86s)]
*  No, no, they love that. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1284.86s)]
*  Also, that was good. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1286.86s)]
*  That was good. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1287.86s)]
*  It was good, but go on him. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1288.86s)]
*  It's like saying, like, Brazilian girls are hot. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1289.86s)]
*  It's like, yeah, you know, like saying anything that, like, nobody's thought of. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1292.3s)]
*  Yeah, why are you overcompensating with always announcing this? [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1295.54s)]
*  It feels like insecurity. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1296.74s)]
*  It feels like insecurity. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1297.74s)]
*  If you truly believe that you're the best, like if you've read a history book, right, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1298.94s)]
*  then you wouldn't need to, you know, cry about it all the time. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1304.7s)]
*  But I feel like there's an insecurity going on. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1307.1s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1309.58s)]
*  And that might happen with a guy who has six inch thumbs. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1310.58s)]
*  Dude, imagine the insecurity of jerking off with a six inch thumb and you just got that [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1313.66s)]
*  shit wrapped around you. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1318.02s)]
*  Three times. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1319.5s)]
*  Or you gotta have a huge, look at those things. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1323.5s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1338.5800000000002s)]
*  Imagine he's giving back shots and got his finger in the thumb, he's like, yo, take your [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1339.5800000000002s)]

*  All right, listen, you have great thumbs and everything, you're awesome. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1348.38s)]

*  Like, the more I subscribe to this idea that like, governments are, what did, how did Smith [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1407.22s)]
*  put it, like a honey pot? [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1412.22s)]
*  Hand in the evil or a honey pot? [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1413.22s)]
*  No, no, like, governments aren't, but like, you can make money, like any connectivity [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1414.4s)]
*  you have to the government, you can make money. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1417.4s)]
*  They're gonna give you contracts, and this is not just, this is not pure corruption, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1418.96s)]
*  right? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1422.72s)]
*  Like, if you know the mayor of the small town and you have a construction company, he might [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1423.72s)]
*  give you the job to fix the bridge or whatever it is, right? [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1426.84s)]
*  And the biggest government or the most powerful government in the world is obviously gonna [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1430.08s)]
*  have a lot of honey, and that needs to go around. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1434.44s)]
*  And you wanna make sure that there's two candidates in there that are gonna insure your honey. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1436.3600000000001s)]
*  And then if you have an outsider candidate that might give you honey or might not, might [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1442.4599999999998s)]
*  not is terrifying. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1446.62s)]
*  The idea that like, you might not get a billion dollar contract, you might not be able to [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1448.78s)]
*  scrape a billion dollars worth of honey from some government, not even allowance, but some [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1454.3799999999999s)]
*  government program or a rebuild project or whatever it is, that's terrifying. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1460.34s)]
*  And you would probably do anything in your power to make that person radioactive so they [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1464.6599999999999s)]
*  don't get elected. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1468.34s)]
*  Or maybe even have them shot. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1469.98s)]
*  To me, that lines up. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1472.8s)]
*  Now, here's the thing. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1474.4399999999998s)]
*  Trump might be out there like, dummies, I'm gonna give you the honey. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1475.4399999999998s)]
*  I just like everybody to look at me. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1479.28s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1482.32s)]
*  Like, he might have that angle where he's like... [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1483.32s)]
*  He feels like he just wants to be loved by everybody. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1485.72s)]
*  They should just realize that. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1489.0s)]
*  He wants to be loved by everybody. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1490.0s)]
*  But then why take on the position where literally 50% of people hate you the day you decide [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1491.3999999999999s)]
*  to do it? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1495.8799999999999s)]
*  I don't know if he wants to be loved by everybody. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1496.8799999999999s)]
*  You don't think so? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1497.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, he's like so antagonistic, even if he's not. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1498.8799999999999s)]
*  Obama's fake. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1502.14s)]
*  I don't think he can handle being disliked. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1503.14s)]
*  This is a group of people here. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1505.14s)]
*  They care to be loved by everybody. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1506.14s)]
*  I mean, white people. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1510.14s)]
*  He wants to be loved. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1512.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1513.14s)]
*  Yeah, I think he doesn't like being hated, but he won't pander to get your love. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1514.14s)]
*  He'll be like, fuck you if you don't like me. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1518.98s)]
*  Suck my dick. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1520.6200000000001s)]
*  You're the problem. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1521.6200000000001s)]
*  You're the asshole. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1522.6200000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1523.6200000000001s)]
*  I don't think he needs your approval. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1524.6200000000001s)]
*  That's true. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1525.6200000000001s)]
*  He won't pander. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1526.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1527.6200000000001s)]
*  So wait, why do you cut? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1528.6200000000001s)]
*  I'm just saying in recent times, I haven't been queuing up, but it seems like he's starting [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1529.76s)]
*  to pivot on a lot of his stuff. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1533.4399999999998s)]
*  Like now he's like for IBF and all this stuff. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1535.36s)]
*  The abortion ruling went too far. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1539.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1541.36s)]
*  The Project 2025 he has nothing to do with or whatever. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1542.36s)]
*  That was kind of Democrats holding. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1546.36s)]
*  What is Project 2025? [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1547.36s)]
*  Democrats, I feel like if you read their shit, it feels like they've created a bit of a boogie, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1549.36s)]
*  man. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1554.3999999999999s)]
*  It's like all these tenants that they say Republicans are going to do if Trump wins. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1555.3999999999999s)]
*  They're going to get all these legislation passed. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1559.94s)]
*  The one that's, you know, potentially whatever is abortion banned at every like in every state, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1560.94s)]
*  nationally. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1566.1399999999999s)]
*  When has any party been able to ever do anything? [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1567.1399999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1569.86s)]
*  In the history of government. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1570.86s)]
*  But then they say, just look up Project 2025. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1571.86s)]
*  And if you look it up, that's the one that you're like, well, that's a little crazy. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1572.86s)]
*  But a lot of it you're like, I don't see this happening. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1575.86s)]
*  Or it's not that crazy. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1578.18s)]
*  If you want to make any change in this country that is major, major, it's going to be civil [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1579.74s)]
*  war. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1583.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1584.98s)]
*  But a major change. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1586.68s)]
*  Blacks free, war, million Americans die. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1587.68s)]
*  Like, there's no, it's incremental. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1590.96s)]
*  It's all these tiny. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1593.72s)]
*  But the first time abortion got overruled. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1594.72s)]
*  But they had to call the federal government just to get black people education. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1595.72s)]
*  It's come on. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1599.64s)]
*  This is like a, if there's any big fucking change, people die, war, etc. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1601.32s)]
*  Nothing's going to happen. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1606.72s)]
*  Doesn't matter who wins. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1607.72s)]
*  I just can't fathom that this 2025 thing, immediately they flip everything on its head. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1609.32s)]

*  People are like, something's from my Telegram. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1695.38s)]
*  Basically. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1696.38s)]
*  I use it to buy drugs, but outside of that. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1697.38s)]
*  Do you have it? [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1698.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1699.38s)]
*  So everybody has it? [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1700.5200000000002s)]
*  I don't have it. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1701.5200000000002s)]
*  About a billion people on the planet use it actively. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1702.5200000000002s)]
*  What? [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1706.5200000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1707.5200000000002s)]
*  950 million or something like that. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1708.5200000000002s)]
*  It's the new WhatsApp. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1709.5200000000002s)]
*  A lot of them are new. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1710.5200000000002s)]
*  Nah, we use WhatsApp. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1711.5200000000002s)]
*  There's a big contingent of the usership. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1712.5200000000002s)]
*  What is Telegram? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1718.2800000000002s)]
*  Let's just say what it is right now. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1719.4s)]
*  It's basically a messaging platform that is kind of marketed as like an encryption service [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1720.88s)]
*  where the messages are encrypted. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1726.0400000000002s)]
*  Not everything is encrypted by default, but you're able to do encrypted messaging from [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1727.84s)]
*  ... [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1731.82s)]
*  Mark, you've been trying to do this with something called Cyber Dust. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1732.82s)]
*  I don't know if you remember doing this. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1733.82s)]
*  Yes, and then the message wipes away or something like that. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1734.82s)]
*  Yeah, and then basically it's not stored on a cloud. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1737.1s)]
*  It's stored on the devices. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1738.5s)]
*  That's the big thing. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1739.5s)]
*  That is pretty fire. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1740.5s)]
*  You're able to talk. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1741.5s)]
*  Even Telegram doesn't have access to ... well, supposedly doesn't have access to it. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1742.5s)]
*  Then you're able to do private messaging. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1747.5s)]
*  You're able to do group messaging. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1748.5s)]
*  You're able to do channels up to like 200,000 people. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1749.5s)]
*  Whereas WhatsApp and I think Messenger can do like 1,200,000. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1752.58s)]
*  So it's WhatsApp, but it's fully encrypted so you're protected. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1755.96s)]
*  Then naturally, if you have something fully encrypted and protected, the dregs of society [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1758.8400000000001s)]
*  will use this so that they can carry out their nefarious plots to do whatever they want to [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1764.4s)]
*  make money illegally. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1769.24s)]
*  Or you're living in Russia and you want to talk about this regime that's in there, or [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1770.24s)]
*  you're in Hong Kong and you want to make a protest. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1773.96s)]
*  The negative is people who are going to use this to do illegal activity. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1776.2s)]
*  They're going to sell drugs. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1782.1000000000001s)]
*  They're going to sell underage pornography. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1783.1000000000001s)]
*  They're going to sell weapons. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1784.5800000000002s)]
*  The positive is that you can use this for free speech in places that don't allow it. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1786.3400000000001s)]
*  Okay, fair enough. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1791.66s)]
*  Any other positives we're not seeing? [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1793.38s)]
*  No, I mean, basically the question is like, do people have a right to free speech and [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1795.14s)]
*  not being surveilled by the government? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1799.38s)]
*  That's like the ultimate overarching question. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1802.3400000000001s)]
*  Telegram would say yes. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1803.98s)]
*  Do people have a right to that? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1804.98s)]
*  No. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1806.42s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1807.42s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1808.42s)]
*  That's American excellence. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1809.42s)]
*  If you want that, you got to come here. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1811.3600000000001s)]
*  No, we don't even get that. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1812.8000000000002s)]
*  Say again? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1813.8000000000002s)]
*  We don't even have... [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1814.8000000000002s)]
*  Hey, silence. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1815.8000000000002s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1818.8000000000002s)]
*  No, but yeah, I don't want every country to have free speech because that's one of the [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1820.8000000000002s)]
*  things that makes us awesome. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1823.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, because if everyone's awesome, the one who has it is awesome. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1825.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and we're regular. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1827.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, fuck. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1828.8000000000002s)]
*  I love it when they put people in jail in other countries. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1829.8000000000002s)]
*  And then we have no free speech. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1831.8000000000002s)]
*  Now we're talking, Mark. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1833.8000000000002s)]
*  Now we're talking. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1834.8000000000002s)]
*  That could be sick. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1835.8000000000002s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1836.8000000000002s)]
*  Because then we're different. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1837.8000000000002s)]
*  For sure. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1838.8000000000002s)]
*  We arrest people in the UK for making fun of you guys or whatever. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1840.18s)]
*  And just doing a Facebook post like arrest them. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1843.18s)]
*  Exactly, that's what we fought for. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1846.18s)]
*  We fought to do that. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1847.18s)]
*  Yeah, Indian Navy, that's not funny. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1848.18s)]
*  Arrest that guy. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1849.18s)]
*  Yeah, you should definitely put that guy in an American prison and then we'll frame him [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1850.18s)]
*  immediately so you can give him a piece of meat. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1854.18s)]
*  Give him a Wi-Fi. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1856.18s)]
*  Put him in prison cell. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1857.18s)]
*  Yes, this guy's a genius. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1858.18s)]
*  Prison stalling. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1859.18s)]
*  Putting those thumbs to work. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1860.18s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1861.18s)]
*  Dude, this guy, Pavel, is crazy. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1862.18s)]
*  The whole story gets even wilder. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1863.18s)]
*  So basically, he's a Russian dude. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1865.18s)]
*  He's known as the Mark Zuckerberg in Russia. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1867.06s)]
*  He basically creates Facebook in Russia in 2006. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1869.0s)]
*  This is a website called VKontakte. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1871.2800000000002s)]
*  And it's basically Russian Facebook. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1875.0800000000002s)]
*  While he's building it, he gets swatted by Russian officials. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1878.0s)]
*  They're banging on his door and they're like, hey, give us a bunch of information from the [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1880.6000000000001s)]

*  I'm not doing it. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1891.96s)]
*  They're banging on his door and literally he's posting memes of dogs and hoodies and [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1892.96s)]
*  shit just goofing off. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1896.16s)]
*  They're banging on his door like, all right, we're going to arrest you. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1898.3000000000002s)]

*  And it basically gets to a head and he's like, all right, I'm out. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1901.98s)]
*  He sells his shares, leaves the company, and could just go sail from the sunset. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1905.7s)]
*  Has a ton of money, leaves Russia, living in Europe, having a great time, says, fuck [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1909.3000000000002s)]
*  it, I'm making another app, Telegram. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1913.98s)]
*  Makes Telegram and pretty much right away creates the platform that does everything [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1916.5800000000002s)]
*  that we're saying. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1921.94s)]
*  Has encryption, da da da. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1922.94s)]
*  And then he becomes very wealthy. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1924.22s)]
*  He gets courted by Macron in France. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1926.76s)]
*  In 2018, Macron goes to him and goes, hey, we want you to be a French citizen. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1929.6s)]
*  We want you to make the headquarters of France. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1934.56s)]
*  We want to make a partnership. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1935.96s)]
*  A couple of years goes by, in 2021, he becomes a French citizen, which is like extremely [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1936.96s)]
*  hard. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1940.48s)]
*  You have to live in France. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1941.48s)]
*  They just like open the doors. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1942.48s)]
*  And do it very quickly. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1943.48s)]
*  Extremely quickly. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1944.48s)]
*  They just give him citizenship. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1945.48s)]
*  Just off rip. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1946.48s)]
*  But there's certain situations where they do do that. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1947.48s)]
*  They basically are like a foreigner of merit. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1948.48s)]
*  But even still, you have to be a French speaker, which to my understanding, he's not a French [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1950.68s)]
*  speaker. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1954.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1955.04s)]
*  Just like give it to him anyway. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1956.06s)]
*  What people don't really realize is in 2017, allegedly, French intelligence hacked into [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1957.34s)]
*  his cell phone and they were able to surveil him and look at what he was doing prior to [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1962.1s)]
*  the meeting with Macron. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1967.18s)]
*  And so they're looking into his phone to see what he's up to. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1968.6599999999999s)]
*  And it's not really clear what they found. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1970.74s)]
*  But this was predating the meeting with them. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1972.8999999999999s)]
*  He basically is like, I don't know. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1975.36s)]
*  He has the company in Berlin for a little and then goes to UAE and that's where he sets [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1977.1599999999999s)]
*  it up and actually has the headquarters. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1979.82s)]
*  Everyone wants access to the data. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1982.34s)]
*  Everyone's using it. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1983.34s)]
*  There's a billion people. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1984.34s)]
*  It's being used on both sides of the Russian-Ukraine war. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1985.36s)]
*  It's being used on both sides of Israel-Hamas war. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1987.36s)]
*  It's being used by everyone. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1991.24s)]
*  It's being used in India. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1992.6799999999998s)]
*  It's being literally like narcos and fucking Mexico are using it. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1993.6799999999998s)]
*  So everyone has a vested interest. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1997.3s)]
*  The FBI went to one of their engineers and basically offered them a deal to give them [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=1998.9199999999998s)]
*  backdoor access to get information for it. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2005.3999999999999s)]
*  Allegedly, no one has access to the backdoor of all the data. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2008.9599999999998s)]
*  But some people speculate that his extreme wealth. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2012.72s)]
*  Again, he's the 120th richest person in the world. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2014.62s)]
*  He's the richest foreigner in Dubai. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2017.4599999999998s)]
*  He's extremely wealthy. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2019.2199999999998s)]
*  I think it's like a hundred something billion. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2020.2199999999998s)]
*  They go to him and they're like, hey, we want this thing. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2023.06s)]
*  Allegedly, some of his money is not from the app itself. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2025.34s)]
*  It's actually from money from foreign governments to give them access to the data. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2029.1399999999999s)]
*  That's a speculation that's not confirmed. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2033.1399999999999s)]
*  But that's what some people have been saying. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2034.82s)]
*  All that to say, basically, he goes to Paris, gets arrested. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2036.9399999999998s)]
*  Now he's like awaiting sentencing, could get 20 years. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2041.06s)]
*  All the charges are basically all the things that are done on the platform, meaning like [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2043.6s)]
*  drugs, weapons, illegal pornography, shit like that. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2048.2s)]
*  He's now an accomplice and complicit with all of those actions. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2052.6s)]
*  And a profiteer. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2055.36s)]
*  In a way, yeah. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2057.12s)]
*  In a way. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2058.12s)]
*  It's not as direct as like Silk Road where they were taking a percentage of every transaction. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2059.12s)]
*  But he's obviously gotten very wealthy from this platform. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2062.2s)]
*  So the question is, are the people that host platforms responsible for everything that [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2066.12s)]
*  goes on the platform? [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2069.44s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2070.44s)]
*  The French government is saying that he didn't cooperate with them. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2072.06s)]
*  He's saying we're completely in good standing with all the rules and regulations regarding [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2076.06s)]
*  social media platforms. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2080.34s)]
*  This could be complete bullshit because I just saw in a random tweet. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2081.38s)]
*  But I think WhatsApp has certain restrictions and punitive measures if you're sharing child [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2084.06s)]
*  pornography or something like that. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2095.46s)]
*  They have a way to tell. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2096.86s)]
*  And they have a way that you can put those restrictions on the app. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2098.1800000000003s)]
*  And they've complied with that. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2100.7599999999998s)]
*  In other words, they were asked to comply and they were like, yes, we will comply. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2102.12s)]
*  Is my understanding from this random tweet from a person that could be a complete liar. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2106.3599999999997s)]
*  Zuckerberg and Metta are very forthcoming with the government. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2109.7599999999998s)]
*  Either covertly where they're making deals with three letters or even just him going [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2113.2799999999997s)]
*  in front of the Senate, doing hearings. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2117.56s)]
*  But my understanding is that they rejected that type of control on the platform. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2120.4399999999996s)]
*  He said that it's not necessary that they try to censor negative content. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2126.12s)]
*  It's not just a complete free speech platform. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2130.2999999999997s)]
*  We do censored content of things like illegal pornography, but we're not going to just give [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2132.54s)]
*  you guys access to the data. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2136.38s)]
*  Oh, so they claim that they are censoring it. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2137.7s)]
*  They're just not going to let someone else be the censor. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2139.9s)]
*  That's what they claim. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2142.5s)]
*  They claim that they're within the regulatory guidelines. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2143.5s)]
*  But how can you prove that if there's no data? [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2148.62s)]
*  Yeah, and if you can... [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2150.62s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2151.62s)]
*  They're going to go to court, basically. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2152.62s)]
*  Ah, OK. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2154.42s)]
*  So then if they are doing it, then he'll be fine. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2155.42s)]
*  So the... [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2157.7799999999997s)]
*  Oh. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2158.7799999999997s)]
*  He'll go to court so you can look through his stuff? [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2159.8s)]
*  This is where it gets crazy. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2161.8s)]
*  Oh, it's crazier. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2162.8s)]
*  So there's a bunch of theories. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2163.8s)]
*  So one theory is like the French control theory. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2165.84s)]
*  There's two parts to it. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2169.6400000000003s)]
*  One is basically like, oh, we want to protect kids. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2170.76s)]
*  You're putting illegal pornography on this website. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2173.2400000000002s)]
*  We can't censor it. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2175.5s)]
*  It's going everywhere. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2176.5600000000004s)]
*  There's all these violent criminals, da-da-da-da. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2177.5600000000004s)]
*  Which might be true, but also is the perfect shield to get whatever your actual reasoning [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2178.88s)]
*  is. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2183.6400000000003s)]
*  If you say, I want to protect kids, no one can argue with you. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2184.6400000000003s)]
*  They want to protect kids, but legal age is 13 and 13. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2186.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great fucking point. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2188.9s)]
*  The last country that cares about protecting kids is teenagers. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2189.9s)]
*  Teenagers, alright. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2192.9s)]
*  They're trying to protect 12 girls. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2193.9s)]
*  But then the show's like a little hypocrisy because... [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2195.5800000000004s)]
*  Damn, 12 is 17 for them. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2197.5s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2199.5s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2200.5s)]
*  That's fucking crazy. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2201.5s)]
*  That's wild, yo. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2204.5s)]
*  That's an almost legal ban. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2205.5s)]
*  Very legal. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2207.5s)]
*  12. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2208.5s)]
*  Wow. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2209.5s)]
*  Yeah, that girl's a little young, where she looks 12 and a half. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2210.5s)]
*  Dude. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2212.5s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2215.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2216.5s)]
*  But it's a little hypocritical, this whole thing, because Russia tried to shut down Telegram [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2218.24s)]
*  in 2018. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2222.04s)]
*  Same exact thing after he had left. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2223.04s)]
*  They tried to shut it down. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2224.64s)]
*  They said, hey, we're kicking it off. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2225.64s)]
*  They couldn't do it. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2226.64s)]
*  And all the media reporting was like, oh, this totalitarian regime trying to stop protests [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2227.64s)]
*  and try to stop da-da-da. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2231.16s)]
*  And now when it's happening in the West, everyone's like, oh, we got to protect the kids. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2232.48s)]
*  This is a dangerous platform, yada yada yada. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2236.24s)]
*  And now even Russian spokespeople are putting pressure like, look, the free speech of the [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2238.34s)]
*  West. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2242.36s)]
*  Look what's happening, da-da-da-da. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2243.36s)]
*  Wild. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2244.36s)]
*  So there's that. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2245.36s)]
*  The other element is that potentially they hack into his phone in 2017 prior to the meeting. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2246.36s)]
*  Apparently, and obviously, you know, France has had a slew of terrorist attacks throughout [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2252.2200000000003s)]
*  the 2000s. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2256.34s)]
*  2015 was a massive one that killed 130,000 people from the Islamic State, from ISIS. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2257.34s)]
*  That was part of the slew? [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2261.1800000000003s)]

*  The other idea is that apparently Macron has been using Telegram since 2010, and some [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2493.22s)]
*  people think that the platform is still in Russian control. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2498.3399999999997s)]
*  So basically all of the French government correspondences are now able to be seen by [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2502.06s)]
*  the Russians. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2508.72s)]
*  So now France is trying to pull it back a little. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2510.3399999999997s)]
*  Alright guys, let's take a break for a second. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2512.2599999999998s)]
*  I need to talk to you about something very near and dear to my heart, something that [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2513.56s)]
*  I used to do way more and I haven't done in about seven months, and that is sleep. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2516.56s)]
*  When they say sleep is the most important thing, you don't really consider it because [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2521.08s)]
*  you can do it whenever you want. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2525.12s)]
*  You can take naps, you can catch up, you're like, ah sleep isn't that important. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2526.88s)]
*  And you have a child and then that goes out the window. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2530.12s)]
*  So sleep is something that I have to maximize, it's something that you should absolutely [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2533.44s)]
*  be maximizing. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2537.56s)]
*  How are you going to do that? [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2538.56s)]
*  8 Sleep, number 8 Sleep, has a brilliant, they say buzz-worthy sleep technology. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2539.56s)]
*  I'm just going to say it's brilliant. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2547.7599999999998s)]
*  They're adjusting the temperature of your sleep apparatus, and there's a reason why [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2550.94s)]
*  I say sleep apparatus, because it's not just bed, okay? [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2556.1400000000003s)]
*  But they are adjusting, I'll get to it, they're adjusting the temperature of that sleep apparatus. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2559.6600000000003s)]
*  And because of that, it is fluctuating with your body temperature and maintaining the [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2564.7000000000003s)]
*  exact temperature that you need to maximize your sleep. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2570.1600000000003s)]
*  I know it sounds very sophisticated, you're like, oh my god, I gotta buy a whole new bed, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2574.7000000000003s)]
*  I don't want to do that, I don't know if it's comfortable. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2577.42s)]
*  No, you don't have to, and this is what's genius about them. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2579.6s)]
*  Do they have mattresses that you can buy? [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2580.96s)]
*  Yes, of course they do. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2582.56s)]
*  But they also have a sheet that does this, so you can keep your mattress. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2584.0s)]
*  The pod is what it's called, so you can keep your mattress, you can use this sheet that [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2588.48s)]
*  has all this technology baked into it, you're going to get the best sleep of your life, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2593.1s)]
*  you're going to maximize your sleep. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2596.04s)]
*  And then if you are really seduced by 8 Sleep, or if you're already really seduced, you go [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2598.0s)]
*  out and you can get the mattress and you can go dive in completely. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2602.78s)]
*  This Pod 4 Ultra can cool down each side of the bed to 20 degrees Fahrenheit below room [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2606.82s)]
*  temperature. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2611.7000000000003s)]
*  Think about that, or heat up, depending on what you need. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2612.7000000000003s)]
*  There's also now an adjustable base that fits between your mattress and your bed frame to [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2614.7400000000002s)]

*  If you snore, the pod can detect your snoring and automatically lift your head by a few [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2625.46s)]
*  degrees to improve airflow and stop you or your partner snoring. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2629.2200000000003s)]

*  Let's talk about this. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2669.7400000000002s)]
*  Have you heard that the flavored air category is quickly becoming the leading alternative [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2670.7400000000002s)]
*  to vaping and smoking? [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2674.5s)]
*  It is an entirely new movement toward quitting smoking and vaping and is led by these guys [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2675.94s)]

*  It's not like vaping. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2686.9s)]
*  If vaping was like a sugar-filled soda, this bad boy right here, it would be like an early [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2687.9s)]

*  There's a NATO theory that basically because both sides of the war are using this, not [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2751.96s)]
*  only for like encrypted strategic data, but also for like geo locating where they are [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2756.2s)]
*  based off of pings of where their phones are at, they can know where the Russians are situated. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2760.04s)]
*  And so then so basically NATO wants the information. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2766.3199999999997s)]
*  They want to try to arrest this guy and basically give him a deal and be like, hey, give us [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2768.7599999999998s)]
*  all the information about the Russian military. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2771.56s)]
*  So there's a little bit of a fear. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2773.8s)]
*  Massad. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2775.86s)]

*  What are they doing? [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2783.86s)]

*  There's this, one of the people he was arrested with was his girlfriend. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2787.3s)]

*  Yeah, she's objectively a piece. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2878.64s)]
*  Some people are claiming that because of her geolocating everywhere that she was with him [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2879.64s)]
*  over the past couple of weeks that they were able to basically pin him whenever he landed [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2887.48s)]
*  in France because she was posting about it from the private jet. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2891.94s)]

*  It's just a dumb broad. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2903.62s)]
*  But now some people are saying because there was a massive leak from anti-Israeli hackers [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2906.08s)]
*  that basically pulled a bunch of information from the Israeli government about their operations [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2910.9s)]
*  in Gaza and West Bank. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2915.52s)]

*  That's not what the platform is for. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2933.04s)]
*  I'm not censoring the information. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2934.04s)]
*  And then Mossad has to go get rid of them. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2935.92s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2938.56s)]

*  He's selling a hundred billion dollars. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2979.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2980.46s)]
*  And he's still going through this nonsense for what? [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2981.46s)]
*  So this is the last theory. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2982.46s)]
*  I think he's getting money from everybody. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2983.46s)]
*  And French ain't offering him enough money. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2984.46s)]
*  He's like, nah, you're not giving me enough for the back door. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2985.46s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2986.46s)]

*  Russia's giving me money for the back door. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2989.46s)]
*  This is the last theory that I found that was, that was the biggest. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2990.46s)]
*  I mean, I'm not going to lie. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2991.46s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2992.46s)]

*  This one is fun. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=2994.46s)]
*  What average voter is going to be swayed off tele... [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3015.18s)]
*  The thing I can't figure out is why he flew to France. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3018.58s)]
*  Why did he go to France? [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3021.94s)]
*  Why did he go to France? [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3022.94s)]
*  He landed in France. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3024.42s)]
*  Apparently he was persona non grata. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3025.42s)]
*  He knew that he shouldn't be in France. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3026.42s)]
*  He knew that they were trying to get him. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3028.14s)]
*  Oh, I got it. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3029.7400000000002s)]
*  And he flies. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3030.94s)]
*  And I got it. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3031.94s)]
*  He flies to France, gets off the plane. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3033.7000000000003s)]
*  When he gets arrested, he tells the officers, allegedly, I'm here to have dinner with Macron. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3035.86s)]
*  Why does he go there? [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3041.06s)]
*  He flew from Azerbaijan. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3042.06s)]
*  That's the last place his plane was at. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3043.38s)]
*  I know why. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3044.58s)]
*  This is not even a joke. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3045.58s)]
*  The dump in the Paralympic. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3048.58s)]
*  He's getting arrested no matter where he goes. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3052.7s)]
*  He is the best relationship with France. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3056.2599999999998s)]
*  So he's like, you guys can lock me up. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3058.54s)]
*  Let's figure this out. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3060.58s)]
*  Essentially, protect me. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3061.58s)]
*  If the whole world's after him, go. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3062.8599999999997s)]
*  So that's the theory, basically. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3065.58s)]
*  But it gets a little deeper. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3068.02s)]
*  He was in Azerbaijan. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3070.06s)]
*  I love when you do this. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3071.06s)]
*  This is so much fun. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3072.06s)]
*  This is great. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3073.06s)]
*  He was in Azerbaijan, like the 24th of August. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3074.06s)]
*  Who else was in Azerbaijan? [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3079.8199999999997s)]

*  not have the protection. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3338.46s)]
*  Elon has the protection of the United States government. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3339.46s)]

*  All these guys. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3355.46s)]
*  Elon. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3356.46s)]
*  So he's got like four or five kids that he claims. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3357.46s)]

*  Yes. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3365.06s)]
*  That's what billionaires should do. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3366.06s)]
*  You know when a horse wins like a triple crown and they just put it on the pasture and he [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3367.06s)]
*  just gets other horses pregnant? [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3370.06s)]
*  Secretariat. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3372.06s)]
*  We should do that with billionaires. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3373.06s)]
*  We did an old flagrant episode about that with LeBron. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3374.06s)]
*  Like what would his cum cost? [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3375.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3376.56s)]
*  But that's why he doesn't own anything. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3377.56s)]
*  So these girls can't cum after shit. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3379.56s)]
*  Oh, is that his thing? [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3381.56s)]
*  Was he the guy that was like, I don't own anything? [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3382.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3384.56s)]
*  Smart. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3385.56s)]
*  So maybe he doesn't. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3386.56s)]
*  So where is his actual money? [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3387.56s)]
*  Like what is the value? [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3388.56s)]
*  A lot of it's in crypto, yeah. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3389.56s)]
*  A lot of it's in crypto. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3390.56s)]
*  Got it right there. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3391.66s)]
*  Got it. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3392.66s)]
*  So there's no way to impose your will on him. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3393.66s)]
*  Maybe that's why Elon sold all his shit too. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3396.66s)]
*  He's like, you're not going to seize my assets. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3398.66s)]
*  You're not going to do any of this stuff. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3400.66s)]

*  I guess you can't make crypto liquid, but inaccessible as possible. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3408.66s)]
*  You can't leverage me. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3412.66s)]
*  You can't put your thumb on me in any single way. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3413.66s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3417.66s)]

*  Now, if your platform has no rules, if they're not punishing these people. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3603.06s)]

*  There was a violent protest thing against the Iran government that was targeting specific [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3616.5s)]
*  people for assassination or some shit. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3620.58s)]
*  They pulled that down. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3622.58s)]
*  They've done that a couple other times. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3623.58s)]

*  porn being sent around? [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3656.06s)]
*  You're a free speech absolutist, but there you got to draw the line. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3657.06s)]
*  Everybody no matter how much you like free speech, kids and violence, I can't be okay [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3661.2599999999998s)]

*  not shutting any of that down. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3673.18s)]
*  To be honest, on that front, war is violence. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3674.18s)]
*  On that front, it's like, the violence is happening. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3676.62s)]

*  I mean, they should be responsible. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3779.54s)]
*  No, the person who created the apps. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3781.54s)]
*  No, they shouldn't be responsible for the thing. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3783.54s)]
*  What they should do is punish the users that were involved. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3785.54s)]
*  So they should just kick them off. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3787.54s)]
*  If they didn't police it. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3789.54s)]
*  Yeah, if they're not policing it. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3791.54s)]
*  And then something happens because of... [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3793.54s)]
*  So that's what I'm saying, to your point, those are the things you need to police. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3795.54s)]
*  You need to police violence, you need to police child activity. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3797.54s)]
*  And the thing that sucks about this, [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3799.54s)]
*  is if there's any examples that can prove, [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3801.54s)]
*  oh, y'all didn't shut this guy down, [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3803.54s)]
*  and he's doing child pornography or whatever, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3805.54s)]
*  then your whole argument falls apart. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3807.54s)]
*  Now, when you're buying drugs on Telegram, [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3809.54s)]
*  are you being explicit with what you're asking for? [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3811.54s)]
*  You're still using vague language. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3813.54s)]
*  It's mad explicit. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3815.54s)]
*  Really? [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3817.54s)]
*  Yeah, because you know, well, I think it's encrypted on both ends. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3819.54s)]
*  Wow. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3821.54s)]
*  Makes it easy. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3823.54s)]
*  You don't have to put a little pill emoji. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3825.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3827.54s)]
*  I need a medication. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3829.54s)]
*  I need Tylenol. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3831.54s)]
*  Statin, quick. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3833.54s)]
*  I think that might have been me, bro. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3835.54s)]
*  But should the web hosting service, should they be responsible? [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3837.54s)]
*  Yes. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3839.54s)]
*  Is it Amazon's fault? [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3841.54s)]
*  How far back do you want to go? [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3843.54s)]
*  It's illegal in America. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3845.54s)]
*  In the 90s, they made a law about this. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3847.54s)]
*  Oh, now you got energy. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3849.54s)]
*  I threw up. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3851.54s)]
*  Now you're ready to go, for real? [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3853.54s)]
*  A little bit. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3855.54s)]
*  What do you think you got, man? [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3857.54s)]
*  A little bit is worse. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3859.54s)]
*  That makes me sound concerned. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3861.54s)]
*  Do you got the inverted ass like Hank Hill? [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3863.54s)]
*  Why are you asking about that? [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3865.54s)]
*  What you want to know for? [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3867.54s)]
*  I have to say, how committed is he to the look? [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3869.54s)]
*  He's feeling ill right now. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3873.54s)]
*  Are you going to do this to him right now? [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3875.54s)]
*  He's feeling better now. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3877.54s)]
*  Oh, you're back. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3879.54s)]
*  Why are you asking about his ass, bro? [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3881.54s)]
*  That was crazy for you. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3883.54s)]
*  We're good. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3885.54s)]
*  Where did you go? [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3887.54s)]
*  We were in Scotland for the wedding. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3889.54s)]
*  Shout out to Cassetta. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3891.54s)]
*  The audio coach, Tom Cassetta, got married, man. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3893.54s)]
*  Congratulations. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3897.54s)]
*  The way it looked absolutely beautiful. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3899.54s)]
*  Miles' tilt blew up. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3901.54s)]
*  We were in exotic AC. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3903.54s)]
*  Miles got naked right now. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3905.54s)]
*  Yeah, Miles. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3907.54s)]
*  Look at that cute little tuchus. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3911.54s)]
*  I'm going back to being sick. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3913.54s)]
*  You guys can continue the fight. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3915.54s)]
*  Why? What's going on? [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3917.54s)]
*  You got muscle pumps or what? [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3919.54s)]
*  Look at his ass. Don't it look like an angry Asian? [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3921.54s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3933.54s)]
*  This one of Miles? [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3935.54s)]
*  How you pulled that out that quick, bro? [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3937.54s)]
*  You're a bad friend. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3939.54s)]
*  I just got Aspics for days. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3941.54s)]
*  I keep them lined up. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3943.54s)]
*  Put them in my pocket. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3945.54s)]
*  So wait, now hold on. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3947.54s)]
*  There's a few other things that we need to discuss. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3949.54s)]
*  Oh, the Internet isn't real. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3951.54s)]
*  Paralympics, bro. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3953.54s)]
*  Can you tell us why the Internet isn't real? [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3955.54s)]
*  Marcus is going to explain the Internet isn't real. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3957.54s)]
*  But we could do some Paralympics to have a nice little buffer. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3959.54s)]
*  Because the Internet isn't real is kind of crazy. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3961.54s)]
*  Paralympics, let's do it. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3963.54s)]
*  I've just been gripped, bro. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3965.54s)]
*  I've just been watching a lot. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3967.54s)]
*  You haven't been watching it? [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3969.54s)]
*  You had a great point. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3971.54s)]
*  The Paralympics is the real Olympics. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3973.54s)]
*  Why isn't this the Olympics? [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3975.54s)]
*  This is the real Olympics. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3977.54s)]
*  Guys with two legs and two arms running. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3979.54s)]
*  Everybody could run. Everybody could throw some shit. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3981.54s)]
*  A guy with no legs running. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3983.54s)]
*  Who texted the group, [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3985.54s)]
*  you all got to watch this, swimming is arms versus legs. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3987.54s)]
*  That was you? [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3989.54s)]
*  That shit cracked me up. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3991.54s)]
*  I seen this Asian dude with just legs kicking [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3993.54s)]
*  and he just battering rammed the end of the race. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3995.54s)]
*  His head slammed into the side. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3997.54s)]
*  Or whatever his name is. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=3999.54s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4001.54s)]
*  So it would actually be more advantageous to have arms and no legs [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4003.54s)]
*  than legs and arms. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4005.54s)]
*  And then he got out the pool looking like that. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4007.54s)]
*  If you think we're being insensitive, [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4015.54s)]
*  can I just show you what the official Paralympics [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4017.54s)]
*  YouTube account is? [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4019.54s)]

*  Nah bro. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4037.54s)]
*  Nah, we can't watch this guy. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4039.54s)]
*  This guy did a triathlon. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4041.54s)]
*  Y'all never did that shit. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4043.54s)]
*  So I don't think that's funny. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4045.54s)]

*  Look at him throwing that poppy seed. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4053.54s)]
*  There's no way they got the girl making poppy seed bagels. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4059.54s)]
*  There's no way they got the girl making poppy seed bagels. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4061.54s)]

*  Wait, this is the official account [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4075.54s)]

*  Yeah, that way. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4105.54s)]
*  To your point earlier, Tommy, that's not the greatest ping pong player in the world, all things considered. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4107.54s)]
*  Oh absolutely. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4109.54s)]
*  In terms of raw skill. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4111.54s)]
*  What is this? [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4113.54s)]
*  How would they add these noises? [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4115.54s)]
*  Yo, the noises are wild. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4117.54s)]
*  They are wild. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4119.54s)]

*  The courage. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4129.54s)]
*  To even try to swim. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4131.54s)]
*  That's insane. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4133.54s)]

*  Oh, look at this upright form. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4143.54s)]
*  Son. Oh, he got one. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4145.54s)]
*  Come on, stop. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4147.54s)]
*  Come on, stop. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4149.54s)]
*  Come on, stop. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4151.54s)]
*  Yo, come on, stop. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4153.54s)]

*  That's me giving him a power. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4161.54s)]
*  Oh! [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4163.54s)]
*  They couldn't cushion that? [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4165.54s)]
*  They couldn't put something soft at that? [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4167.54s)]
*  They give him a head start. They give him a literally. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4169.54s)]
*  Get it? [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4171.54s)]
*  Now this you shouldn't even be able to do. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4173.54s)]
*  So this is what they're posting. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4175.54s)]
*  I'm just addressing it. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4177.54s)]
*  Wait, but what do they... [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4179.54s)]
*  What does this one got, kids? [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4181.54s)]
*  You don't need legs to do this anyway. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4185.54s)]
*  Why are they allowed to compete in this? [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4187.54s)]
*  But if one person is doing this with their mouth or some shit. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4189.54s)]
*  We gotta see the head person. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4191.54s)]
*  No, this is... [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4195.54s)]
*  No, this is regular. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4197.54s)]
*  This is an advantage. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4199.54s)]
*  Yeah, you're lighter. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4201.54s)]
*  Oh, no. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4203.54s)]
*  Oh, no, this is fire. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4205.54s)]
*  The badminton where they got with the midgets playing bad... [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4207.54s)]
*  What's his name? [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4209.54s)]
*  Krishna. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4211.54s)]
*  I ain't doing it. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4213.54s)]
*  Yeah, you say it. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4215.54s)]
*  How do you pronounce that correctly? [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4217.54s)]
*  I would if y'all weren't here. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4219.54s)]
*  This is my rap song. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4221.54s)]
*  If you don't know... [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4223.54s)]
*  Indian last names. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4225.54s)]
*  Now you know. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4227.54s)]
*  That's a nice stride. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4229.54s)]
*  That's actually how you say river in Hindi. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4231.54s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4233.54s)]
*  Oh, no, this is unfair. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4235.54s)]
*  You gotta jump off... [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4237.54s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4239.54s)]
*  Legend, right? [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4241.54s)]
*  Oh, no. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4243.54s)]
*  Oh, let's go. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4245.54s)]
*  Oh, this one I saw. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4247.54s)]
*  This was crazy with the dive. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4249.54s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4251.54s)]
*  No, I can't believe the noise. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4253.54s)]
*  They put the sounds. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4255.54s)]
*  I could watch that for hours. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4257.54s)]
*  Why are you stopping? [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4259.54s)]
*  Can I be honest here? [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4261.54s)]
*  That's gonna make everybody more money. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4263.54s)]
*  Because the more views they get, the more money they can give to the winners. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4265.54s)]
*  So it's all a win. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4267.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4269.54s)]
*  I watched the 100 meter dash. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4271.54s)]
*  Did you see the 100 meter dash? [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4273.54s)]
*  The guy who won it had a version of cerebral palsy. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4275.54s)]
*  But he still ran it in like 10.3 seconds. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4277.54s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4279.54s)]
*  I think he's faking that. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4281.54s)]
*  Right? [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4283.54s)]
*  Because isn't cerebral palsy like a muscular disease where your muscles are like super tense? [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4285.54s)]
*  They're like constantly engaged? [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4287.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4289.54s)]
*  Yeah, I think they have your wrists kind of like that. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4291.54s)]
*  But this guy looks... [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4293.54s)]
*  I mean, he ran 10.3. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4295.54s)]
*  They're like college runners that aren't running 10.3. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4297.54s)]
*  So how are we dictating who's in it or not? [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4299.54s)]
*  I think you should have to be missing something. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4301.54s)]
*  I think a part of you should have to be missing. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4303.54s)]
*  They do different things. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4305.54s)]
*  I think a part of you should have to be missing. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4307.54s)]
*  They do different classes for all the events. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4309.54s)]
*  So it's like, alright, this class is like you're missing a limb. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4311.54s)]
*  This class is like you have a muscular issue. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4313.54s)]
*  This class is da da da da. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4315.54s)]
*  And so it would be like, okay, the 100 meter final for people missing a thing. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4317.54s)]
*  100 meter final for people with something else. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4319.54s)]
*  And which country wins the most? [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4321.54s)]
*  Let's check the medal count. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4323.54s)]
*  That's a great question. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4325.54s)]
*  India. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4327.54s)]
*  Paralympics, Paris. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4329.54s)]
*  Seems like China has 50 gold medals. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4331.54s)]
*  They have 107 total medals. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4333.54s)]
*  Great Britain has 29 gold medals with 57 total and America has 18 gold medals with 50 total. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4335.54s)]
*  And America has 18 gold medals with 50 total. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4339.54s)]
*  Step it up America! [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4341.54s)]
*  So our total medal count is the same as China's gold medal count. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4343.54s)]
*  So our total medal count is the same as China's gold medal count. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4345.54s)]
*  But there's still [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4347.54s)]
*  five more days so we might have a huge turn around [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4349.54s)]
*  five more days so we might have a huge turn around [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4351.54s)]
*  and win 57 medals. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4353.54s)]
*  and win 57 medals. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4355.54s)]
*  We might win 57 gold straight, in which case [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4357.54s)]
*  we got it. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4359.54s)]
*  Is there, China wins zero, sorry. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4361.54s)]
*  No, you're good. Is there not like what? [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4363.54s)]
*  I don't even know how to say this. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4366.78s)]
*  What about the places that we're at war with? Do they not have some good athletes that are missing shit? [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4370.44s)]
*  That's how it started. Yeah. Yeah, but that started with us. That's what I'm saying. But now that we're banging on motherfuckers like [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4375.76s)]
*  Shouldn't they be missing some things and don't they have good runners? [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4382.34s)]
*  You know? Like Afghanistan to have some, you know. Yeah. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4387.26s)]
*  Yeah, like. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4389.96s)]
*  As you were saying. Operation Iraqi Freedom. They should be free from some limbs. Yeah. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4391.96s)]
*  Why is China winning? Like what reason does China have to not to be missing things? I bet they're cheating. Yeah. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4397.4s)]
*  I bet they're cheating. Also, why don't we let them cheat? They train them first and chop it off. Holy moly. That's brilliant. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4403.1s)]
*  That is brilliant. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4409.96s)]
*  If you don't make the main team, you're going second team with a little less. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4411.96s)]
*  Would you do that? Give an arm and a leg to compete in the Olympics? I'm just saying you've dedicated your life. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4416.48s)]
*  But like let's say you dedicate your life to one stupid sport and you just never were good enough to medal. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4430.48s)]
*  What you wouldn't just chop off something and then be the best that's ever done it? [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4436.32s)]
*  I feel like you're describing trans athletes. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4442.08s)]
*  Wow. That was good. That was really good right there. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4444.08s)]
*  Warm up now. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4451.08s)]
*  That was really good right there. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4453.08s)]
*  Sorry, what were you saying about supporting trans athletes? Wow. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4455.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4459.08s)]
*  When paddles in the Olympics and you're not good enough to make it. I've already thought about it. Cut off my left hand. I don't need it. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4461.08s)]
*  I only have to develop a way to do the serve with my right hand because you need to drop the ball. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4468.08s)]
*  But obviously I could figure something. I could do an arm pick. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4474.08s)]
*  That was rude. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4478.08s)]
*  That hurt. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4480.08s)]
*  Should I just be like, hello? [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4482.08s)]
*  What is that? An elephant holding an apple? [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4484.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4486.08s)]
*  Yeah, you're a jerk. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4488.08s)]
*  I'm just agreeing with Alex. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4490.08s)]
*  No, you're also a jerk, but it's mostly Alex the jerk. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4492.08s)]
*  But what did you do that? [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4494.08s)]
*  I cut a piece of my body off. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4496.08s)]
*  Just left hand. You can still do stand up. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4498.08s)]
*  I genuinely thought about it. I swear to God. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4500.08s)]
*  What if you just went trans and competed with women and you don't even actually have to cut some shit off these days? [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4502.08s)]
*  You can just say it. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4506.08s)]
*  I would do that. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4507.08s)]
*  I would absolutely do that. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4508.08s)]
*  You got to tuck, yeah, but that's fine. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4510.08s)]
*  If it gets to the point with trans acceptance, let me tell you this right now. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4511.08s)]
*  If trans acceptance gets to the point where you just say you're trans and then you get to compete with the women. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4516.08s)]
*  You're using future tense. I don't think you need to. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4522.08s)]
*  But it's still a little vague right now. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4525.08s)]
*  I promise you I will do it. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4527.08s)]
*  If padel's in the Olympics, I promise you I will do it. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4529.08s)]
*  That is a promise that I make to you guys. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4535.08s)]
*  If you lose, the stakes are crazy. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4537.08s)]
*  The stakes are down high now. You got to win. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4540.08s)]
*  If you get silver. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4542.08s)]
*  I don't even feel that bad if I lose. I picked up padel at 40 years old and I'm going to beat these girls in a plane. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4544.08s)]
*  Now you're completely... [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4548.08s)]
*  These girls are professional athletes. They're brilliant athletes. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4550.08s)]
*  Athletes. What do you really think about that? [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4553.08s)]
*  There are some sick sports in the Paralympics. I went through all sports. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4555.08s)]
*  Are there any ones that are specific to them? [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4560.08s)]
*  Bochi. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4563.08s)]
*  Oh, the blind? [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4564.08s)]
*  No, bochi, we all know that's a sport. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4565.08s)]
*  No, is there one that's specific for the Paralympics? [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4567.08s)]
*  Yeah, bochi. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4569.08s)]
*  No, but is there a sport...cannonball. Is there like a thing that just they do? [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4570.08s)]
*  What is cannonball? I don't remember that. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4575.08s)]
*  No, it's just... [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4577.08s)]
*  They launch them out of the cannonball. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4578.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. And then whoever makes the biggest splash. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4579.08s)]
*  Or you shoot them into the side of a wooden boat and see if you can sink it. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4581.08s)]
*  That's a good idea. Just take them out to the harbor and put some old pirate ships out there and just shoot them into the side of a wooden boat. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4584.08s)]
*  Some old pirate ships. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4590.08s)]
*  And see if the bubble is sinking. If it sinks, then you win a gold medal. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4592.08s)]
*  They got a couple bangers. They got a gold ball. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4595.08s)]
*  Gold ball's sick. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4598.08s)]
*  Gold ball low-key actually looks awesome. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4599.08s)]
*  You know, this is what y'all were doing during your break. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4601.08s)]
*  I think 12,000 dollars on stake, dude. Just betting on the Paralympics. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4604.08s)]
*  This shit's sick. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4609.08s)]
*  We can all play this. You can put blindfolds on and play it. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4610.08s)]
*  Can you bet into the Paralympics? I would love to do that. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4613.08s)]
*  I've made insane money. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4616.08s)]
*  We have to absolutely talk to Stake about this. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4617.08s)]
*  Okay, wait a minute. So they're all blind and the idea is you're just bowling against other blind people. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4620.08s)]
*  Are they blind or are they just wearing the goggles? [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4625.08s)]
*  They're probably partially and then they have to wear the goggles to make them more blind. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4627.08s)]
*  And then you're basically trying to hear the ball and then jump in position to block it. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4630.08s)]
*  Can you yell other sounds to distract them? [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4635.08s)]
*  Can you be like boing, boing? [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4637.08s)]
*  That I don't know. It might be a strategy. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4642.08s)]
*  Stake, we need to develop a betting apparatus for the Paralympics. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4643.08s)]
*  This will be your most, I don't know if it'll be your most betted, but it would definitely be the most fun. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4647.08s)]
*  Oh, Parawinter Olympics got to be coming soon, right? [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4652.08s)]
*  I think, should Parawinter Olympics be illegal? Like are you really going to roll them down a mountain? [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4654.08s)]
*  Isn't that how avalanches start? [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4658.08s)]
*  That's how they got that one. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4661.08s)]
*  I mean, luge, right? Luge, you can do luge with no legs. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4662.08s)]
*  Luge, they might be the best. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4665.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's the same as kayaking. Same argument. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4666.08s)]
*  Oh, speaking of Stake, football season is finally here. Thank fucking goodness. I'm so excited. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4669.08s)]
*  Oh my god. And I don't care about rooting for the Cowboys anymore. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4675.08s)]
*  So it's going to be the happiest season. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4679.08s)]
*  Are you really off? [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4681.08s)]
*  I just think I don't have a team. I just I'll root if I'm watching a game. Who do I want to win? [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4682.08s)]
*  But yeah, I'm not. There's no team I'm following this whole year. It's just not going to happen. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4686.08s)]
*  It's not. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4690.08s)]
*  What happened to the Chiefs? Are they your Chiefs guy? [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4691.08s)]
*  That's fun. I'll probably root for them against most teams. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4693.08s)]
*  But like even in the playoffs when they were playing the Bills last year, I found myself being like, I'd be great if the Bills won. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4695.08s)]
*  I'd really like the Bills to win one finally. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4700.08s)]
*  So I think I'm just going to kind of be agnostic. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4702.08s)]
*  So you're going game by game, which is the best. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4704.08s)]
*  Actually better for gambling. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4706.08s)]
*  That's true. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4708.08s)]
*  But OK, OK, so you're able to put money on whomever you think could win that game, which I was never capable of doing. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4709.08s)]
*  I could never bet against the Knicks. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4719.08s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, yeah. My bias. I'll bet against the Cowboys. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4720.08s)]
*  Anytime the playoff rolls around, just bet against the Cowboys and then double or nothing. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4722.08s)]
*  Even if you lose, you're going to win at some point. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4726.08s)]
*  You're saying you would do that? [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4728.08s)]
*  I would bet again. I will put it damn near everything I own. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4729.08s)]
*  I mean, don't do that. But like my brain is like, that's the move. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4731.08s)]
*  OK, what? [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4735.08s)]
*  I won't. But that's like it's like. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4736.08s)]
*  What bets does Stake have for us? [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4738.08s)]
*  Stake is they think they said it's Eagles and Green Bay in Brazil, which is going to be fucking. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4740.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that's fair. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4744.08s)]
*  The NFL is going to try to be global as they should. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4745.08s)]
*  They think the Eagles are going to win. I don't actually necessarily agree. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4748.08s)]
*  OK, I think the Packers might make it out of the NFC and go to the Super Bowl this year. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4752.08s)]
*  That good? [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4757.08s)]
*  I guess they ended the year really well and then they lost in the playoffs to San Francisco, who made it to the Super Bowl. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4758.08s)]
*  And they should have beaten them. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4764.08s)]
*  Detroit really should have beaten them. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4767.08s)]
*  But I think the way they lost was so heartbreaking. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4768.08s)]
*  As much as I would love for them to go to the Super Bowl, I don't I don't know if you recover from that in a year. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4771.08s)]
*  Yeah, like they were up like what was it? 21, three or some shit at the end. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4775.08s)]
*  They were dominating and then lost. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4778.08s)]
*  I think Green Bay was close enough that they were like, oh, we ended the year really strong. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4780.08s)]
*  We could have beaten these guys that went to the Super Bowl. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4783.08s)]
*  The quarterback Jordan Love, I think, is he's starting to hit a stride. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4785.08s)]
*  OK, got playoff wins, which Dak Prescott never got already. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4789.08s)]
*  So like I just I think they might be the team and the Eagles. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4792.08s)]
*  I think they peaked. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4795.08s)]
*  Oh, really? Yeah, no pun intended. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4797.08s)]
*  I think they've flown as high as they can fly. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4799.08s)]
*  Like, I just think that I don't know. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4801.08s)]
*  I feel like once a team figures out a running quarterback like Jalen Hurts, and that's what's starting to happen. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4802.08s)]
*  I think that's what's kind of I could be wrong, but I think that's what's got a little window. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4807.08s)]
*  Yeah, there and that window is closed. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4810.08s)]
*  Yeah. And they haven't added any talent to the team. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4812.08s)]
*  There's nothing they added. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4814.08s)]
*  Sequon Barkley, Sequon Barkley, good. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4816.08s)]
*  He's good. But they're they're good. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4818.08s)]
*  They're they manage their team well. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4819.08s)]
*  They always have free agent additions and all that. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4821.08s)]
*  Maybe I can take some of that running load off of. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4822.08s)]
*  I just think if you figure out the QB, it's you can't do anything about that. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4825.08s)]
*  That's fair. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4829.08s)]
*  And then I think you can't bet against the Chiefs to make it to the Super Bowl. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4830.08s)]
*  But they have the Chiefs beating the Ravens in the season opening game this Thursday. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4833.08s)]
*  And I don't think I think that's actually I think that's fine. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4837.08s)]
*  They have the Ravens beating the Chiefs. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4840.08s)]
*  I think that's fine. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4841.08s)]
*  The Ravens beating the Chiefs. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4842.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think week one doesn't matter. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4843.08s)]
*  The Super Bowl winner. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4844.08s)]
*  If you're a dynasty like who gives a fuck about week one. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4845.08s)]
*  Yeah. Casey lost week one last year to Detroit. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4847.08s)]
*  OK, that's right. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4849.08s)]
*  So you're just getting back in the swing of things. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4850.08s)]
*  Everybody had a good summer even celebrating. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4851.08s)]
*  This game means way more to Baltimore than it does Kansas City. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4853.08s)]
*  And Baltimore's got the chip on their shoulder. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4855.08s)]
*  They got a bruise they still got. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4856.08s)]
*  They lost to KC last year, blah, blah, blah. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4857.08s)]
*  So I think that's fine. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4859.08s)]
*  So again, you're going Green Bay and. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4860.08s)]
*  And Baltimore. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4863.08s)]
*  And Baltimore. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4864.08s)]
*  OK, all right. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4865.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's what's at stake. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4866.08s)]
*  I only disagree on Philly and Green Bay. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4867.08s)]
*  And maybe I just hate Philly because I'm still I was born a cowboy fan, raised a cowboy fan, [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4869.08s)]
*  but I just don't see it. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4872.08s)]
*  But yeah, it's dude. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4874.08s)]
*  It's fun. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4875.08s)]
*  I'm so happy football season is in. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4876.08s)]
*  What's crazy. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4877.08s)]
*  I think I'm going to start betting a little bit more like just not crazy money, maybe [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4878.08s)]
*  like a hundred dollar cap. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4882.08s)]
*  But I'm going to start betting this year on stake. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4883.08s)]
*  And I think it's going to be really fun to just like be that's going to add extra stakes, [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4884.08s)]
*  stakes to it. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4889.08s)]
*  I like it. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4890.08s)]
*  Yeah, I like it. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4891.08s)]
*  I like it. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4892.08s)]
*  Yeah, we're going to see. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4893.08s)]
*  I can't wait to see your emotion when you lose money. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4894.08s)]
*  If I cap it at 100, it won't matter as much. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4900.08s)]
*  OK, but when you lose money, betting against the Cowboys, when they finally decide to win [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4902.08s)]
*  and fuck you. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4908.08s)]

*  I would love for you to be a Cowboys fan. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4912.08s)]
*  I'll be a Cowboys fan. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4914.08s)]
*  I would love it. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4916.08s)]
*  Suffer. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4917.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good idea. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4918.08s)]
*  Feel my pain. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4919.08s)]
*  Yes. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4920.08s)]
*  We need some. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4921.08s)]
*  You know what? [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4922.08s)]
*  Can we give us some give us some like really favorable bets for the Cowboys just for the [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4923.08s)]
*  flagrant audience. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4926.24s)]
*  That would be absolutely divine. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4927.24s)]
*  Yeah, that'd be great. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4928.24s)]
*  Let's work that out. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4929.24s)]
*  I have a friend that actually works at the Cowboys back office. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4930.24s)]
*  OK, we can get some tickets back office. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4933.08s)]
*  I don't know nothing back. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4937.08s)]
*  He's not. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4939.08s)]
*  What the fuck is a back office? [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4940.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's a back office because they're behind every other front office. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4941.08s)]
*  He's not high up. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4944.08s)]
*  I didn't say he was high up. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4945.08s)]
*  But you're saying we could go to a Cowboys game and like go to that sick stadium? [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4947.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4951.08s)]

*  I can't wait for the Cowboys with a Super Bowl. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4954.08s)]
*  OK, let's get back to the show. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4957.08s)]
*  All right. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4959.08s)]
*  Fair enough. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4960.08s)]
*  This game is actually sick. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4961.08s)]
*  I would one million percent play that. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4962.08s)]
*  Oh, wheelchair rugby. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4964.08s)]
*  This is an awesome one. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4966.08s)]
*  Yep. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4967.08s)]
*  Seen that one. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4968.08s)]
*  This one is crazy. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4969.08s)]
*  They're like fucking each other up on a wheelchair. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4970.08s)]
*  And they have to play indoors because they can't rule on the ground. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4973.08s)]
*  It's like BattleBots, bro. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4978.08s)]
*  It's fucking crazy. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4979.08s)]
*  But they have there's actually a girl that competes in this and they do like both genders, [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4980.08s)]
*  I'm pretty sure. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4985.08s)]
*  Huh. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4986.08s)]
*  It's kind of interesting. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4987.08s)]
*  Oh, it's progressive. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4988.08s)]
*  It's oh, super aggressive. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4989.08s)]
*  They're fucking each other up. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4990.08s)]
*  These guys are probably all like formerly military and shit. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4991.08s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4993.08s)]

*  And then sitting volleyball. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=4999.08s)]
*  This one is this one is fascinating. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5003.08s)]
*  I'm stoked to see all the people in the stands. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5004.08s)]
*  Oh, packed. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5006.08s)]

*  Son, he got more forehead, bro. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5010.08s)]
*  I mean, dude, that was a really insulting thing to say. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5013.08s)]
*  No, but it was close. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5016.08s)]
*  It was very close. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5017.08s)]
*  I'll let you know, he happens to be the greatest sitting volleyball player of all time. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5018.08s)]
*  Oh, that makes sense. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5021.08s)]
*  He's eight foot one. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5022.08s)]
*  And he hits you with his head. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5023.08s)]
*  Do you know what country he's from? [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5024.08s)]
*  Son, if he hit it with his head, that would have been fire. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5025.08s)]
*  Turn me down. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5027.08s)]
*  Oh, which is ironic because he never did. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5028.08s)]
*  I mean, this guy should not be a lot like this. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5033.08s)]
*  He's got to have some sort of actually paralyze people or they just playing sitting down. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5036.08s)]
*  I think some are missing a leg. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5041.08s)]
*  Some of them. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5042.08s)]
*  What is he acromegaly? [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5043.08s)]
*  What is that? [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5044.08s)]
*  The giant? [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5045.08s)]
*  Yeah, I'm pretty sure. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5046.08s)]
*  I'm pretty sure. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5047.08s)]
*  So I think he got an injury from a motorcycle and like as a teen and then couldn't walk. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5048.08s)]
*  And now it's just a fucking mess. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5053.08s)]
*  My man stood up to celebrate. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5055.08s)]
*  He almost forgot. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5056.08s)]
*  He almost forgot. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5057.08s)]
*  Chill out. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5058.08s)]
*  You are faking a funk homie. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5059.08s)]
*  Chill out. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5060.08s)]
*  But this looks fire. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5061.08s)]

*  Come on, dude. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5130.08s)]
*  There was the one where they do the katas, so it's not like fighting taekwondo. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5131.08s)]
*  You just have to do the choreography of the moves. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5134.08s)]
*  And then there was someone who was just missing. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5138.08s)]
*  It was missing everything. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5140.08s)]
*  And it was just, he was basically just going, hi-yah! [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5141.08s)]
*  And then like rotating his body and just going, hi-yah! [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5144.08s)]
*  That's not, they're not missing shit. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5148.08s)]
*  Oh, they're missing like an arm. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5150.08s)]
*  Arms, yeah. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5151.08s)]
*  So they're missing an arm. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5152.08s)]
*  So you only get points for kicks, I'm pretty sure. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5153.08s)]
*  You can't do any head kicks. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5155.08s)]
*  Dude, this is awesome. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5156.08s)]

*  Imagine you have some injury, you're born without an arm, and all of a sudden you can still [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5159.08s)]
*  fuck people up, get your rage out somehow. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5162.08s)]
*  This shit is awesome. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5163.08s)]
*  This is sick. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5164.08s)]
*  It's just a bunch of Chung-Lis. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5165.08s)]
*  Just get them. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5166.08s)]

*  Okay. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5172.08s)]
*  Now, let's learn about why the internet is completely fake. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5173.08s)]
*  Yeah, what is this? [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5177.08s)]
*  This is wild. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5178.08s)]
*  You ever heard of dead internet theory? [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5179.08s)]
*  No. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5180.08s)]
*  Are we getting another Mark explanation? [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5181.08s)]
*  We might. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5182.08s)]
*  I love it. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5183.08s)]
*  We might be getting another Mark explanation. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5184.08s)]
*  I love it. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5185.08s)]
*  I love it. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5186.08s)]
*  You can cross this video on the internet. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5187.08s)]
*  On the internet, which, why did I see it? [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5188.08s)]
*  Because... [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5190.08s)]
*  That's a good question. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5191.08s)]
*  Basically, the theory goes like around 2015, 2016, the internet changed fundamentally. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5192.08s)]
*  The way that people used it, the type of content you would see, the way people interact, it [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5196.08s)]
*  was like fundamentally changed. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5200.08s)]
*  And the theory basically, and the theory is like generally true, it just matters what [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5201.08s)]
*  percentage of it is true, and I'll explain. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5206.08s)]
*  Basically, the theory is that all the content and the people and basically your entire infrastructure [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5208.08s)]
*  that you're interacting with on every social media platform and throughout the entire internet [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5215.08s)]
*  is fake. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5220.08s)]
*  That it's basically AI bots that you're talking to that are interacting with you, and that [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5222.08s)]
*  90% or 95% of all the content on the internet and all the discourse and conversations on [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5228.08s)]
*  the internet are created by large language model AI robots. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5233.08s)]
*  And basically, this is either used by private individuals that are trying to like profiteer [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5237.08s)]
*  in some capacity or pushing some type of personal ideological agenda or done by the state and [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5241.08s)]
*  state actors in order to manipulate and coerce the population into believing some type of [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5247.08s)]
*  specific narrative or idea. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5252.08s)]
*  Effectively, you don't need to like ban books or ban ideas. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5255.08s)]
*  You can just funnel the discourse of what people are having on the internet exactly [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5258.08s)]
*  how you want it to be. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5263.08s)]
*  I actually think that's awesome if we all start to believe this, then we'll start putting [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5264.08s)]
*  less stock in the fucking idiots online. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5268.08s)]
*  Either the guys shitting on India, no pun intended, or the guys saying whatever racist [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5271.08s)]
*  stuff. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5276.08s)]
*  It's like, I don't even need to take this seriously. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5277.08s)]
*  This is bots. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5278.08s)]
*  I don't even need to engage with this mentally. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5279.08s)]
*  The tricky part is that there's certainly some people that are real. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5281.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5283.08s)]
*  So then the question is, how can you discern who is real and who is a bot? [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5284.08s)]
*  Just write off all of it. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5287.08s)]
*  That's how the easiest off-ramp for my brain. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5289.08s)]
*  It's all fake. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5292.08s)]
*  It's all fake. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5293.08s)]
*  And the ones who are, who cares if it's a negligible amount. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5294.08s)]
*  It's not a bad philosophy. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5297.08s)]
*  The thing that brought this up to me that I thought was fascinating is Destiny, the streamer, [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5298.08s)]
*  did a video where basically on stream he was talking about getting targeted attacks from [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5301.08s)]
*  a bunch of different accounts, calling him names, saying that he's an idiot, da da da. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5306.08s)]
*  That's my bet. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5310.08s)]
*  And they were, he starts going to the channels and seeing like who is the person. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5311.08s)]
*  He was shocked that people don't like him. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5316.08s)]
*  The arrogance. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5318.08s)]
*  That's upsetting. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5319.08s)]
*  He was just curious. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5320.08s)]
*  I'm not going to be an internet conspirator. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5321.08s)]
*  There are guys out there that don't like an extremely opinionated person who knows nothing [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5322.08s)]
*  about the Israel-Gaza conflict and lets people fuck his girlfriend. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5328.08s)]
*  I cannot believe this. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5332.08s)]
*  How could this be? [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5334.08s)]
*  Are you AI? [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5335.08s)]
*  I might be AI. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5336.08s)]
*  I might be AI. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5337.08s)]
*  There's no point where he like reflected and he was like, wow, I'm really opinionated on [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5338.08s)]
*  things that are incredibly divisive and maybe the other side might dislike me. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5343.08s)]
*  There was no point in that. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5346.08s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5347.08s)]
*  I think it was that he was just getting comments immediately after posting anything and being [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5348.08s)]
*  like, who are just these people following me around the internet just shitting on me [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5351.08s)]
*  every chance they get? [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5354.08s)]
*  What is happening? [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5355.08s)]
*  So he clicks on the profiles and the profiles are like, America is best, number one country [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5356.08s)]
*  first. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5361.08s)]
*  And it's like these weird accounts that have weird posting history and it's just all kind [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5362.08s)]
*  of strange. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5365.08s)]
*  And he starts looking at the profile pictures and the profile pictures is like a guy that [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5366.08s)]
*  looks like a regular fucking dude that you would see at Walmart. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5369.08s)]
*  And then behind him are books that aren't real characters. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5372.08s)]
*  It's like fake AI books that have like strange shapes that are supposed to resemble language, [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5378.08s)]
*  but it's not. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5382.08s)]
*  And he's like, oh, the pictures AI, the content, he's able to search tweets and find like other [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5383.08s)]
*  tweets of other accounts with other names and other countries posting similar types [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5388.08s)]
*  of content. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5392.08s)]
*  And he's like, oh, this is a bot. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5393.08s)]
*  And so it's verifiable and true that there are bots that are creating content. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5394.08s)]
*  The question is a percentage. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5398.08s)]
*  And following people. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5399.08s)]
*  The question is a percentage. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5400.08s)]
*  And the question is why? [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5401.08s)]
*  Well, why makes perfect sense. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5402.08s)]
*  Like if you hate somebody, but you don't want to go through the time to hate them, you just [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5404.08s)]
*  sick bots on them all day. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5409.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5410.08s)]
*  Like that makes perfect sense. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5411.08s)]
*  So there is someone who's like, well, I mean, there might be another explanation. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5412.08s)]
*  Or on some Dave Smith shit where it's like, I think he was the one that was saying like [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5415.08s)]
*  the government wants to get their access to their hundred bots or whatever. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5418.08s)]
*  Now, just they want to do what the things they really want to do and then distract you [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5421.08s)]
*  with gender wars or whatever. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5424.08s)]
*  Let's have a bunch of bots and fake news stories and whatever. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5426.08s)]
*  Just getting everybody focused on gender wars. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5429.08s)]
*  And we just keep getting the money how we want to. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5431.08s)]
*  We keep passing laws that we want to. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5433.08s)]
*  We keep doing all that. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5434.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5435.08s)]
*  Now, the other thing that I find very interesting is, is it possible that these companies or [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5436.08s)]
*  private actors that are basically utilizing like the open, you know, software features [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5443.08s)]
*  of these platforms are basically utilizing in such a way to influence the opinions and [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5447.08s)]
*  ideas of influential thought leaders within the United States and around the world? [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5452.08s)]
*  That's the most interesting thing. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5455.08s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5457.08s)]
*  So like basically, you're a guy. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5458.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5460.08s)]
*  That has tons of influence. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5461.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5463.08s)]
*  You happen to be on Twitter. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5464.08s)]
*  You happen to be on Instagram. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5465.08s)]
*  You happen to be on Facebook. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5466.08s)]
*  You're on TikTok. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5467.08s)]
*  You're scrolling. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5468.08s)]
*  You're scrolling. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5469.08s)]
*  We know just from having conversations with different platforms that they can increase. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5470.08s)]
*  We know that they can decrease, but we also know that they can increase the visibility [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5475.08s)]
*  of certain content. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5479.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5480.08s)]
*  Now, they don't have to have a handler for you from the CIA who tells you the opinions [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5482.08s)]
*  that you should have and make sure that you disseminate that information on all your socials [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5488.08s)]
*  and your podcasts, whatever. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5492.08s)]
*  They could do something that is way more manipulative. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5494.08s)]
*  They could just show you videos. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5497.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5500.08s)]
*  That would. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5501.08s)]
*  You're talking about the tech CEOs and stuff, right? [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5502.08s)]
*  I'm talking about, I'm talking about Akash Singh. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5504.08s)]
*  OK. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5508.08s)]
*  I'm talking about Andrew Scholes. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5509.08s)]
*  I'm talking about anybody. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5510.08s)]
*  Anybody. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5511.08s)]
*  We could look on our algorithm, and our algorithm could be curated by not just the tech CEO, [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5512.08s)]
*  but if the tech CEO, we already know that Zuckerberg is working with the government. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5519.08s)]
*  So what if the government was like, listen, we need to get Akash and Andrew to be really [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5523.08s)]
*  on board with ISRM, or we need to get Akash and Andrew to really be on board with Hamas. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5527.08s)]
*  I want you to show them 5x more content showing these different POVs on the subject, and then [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5532.08s)]
*  they will naturally, just through osmosis, start to be more empathetic to one of those [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5540.08s)]
*  sides. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5545.08s)]
*  Now, we know for a fact that you can do that. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5546.08s)]
*  You can curate what somebody sees. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5550.08s)]
*  We know that for a fact, because you can do that with ads. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5551.08s)]
*  You can literally just pay for ads. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5554.08s)]
*  So that's what the most basic version of it is. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5556.08s)]
*  That's actually their monetization strategy. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5558.08s)]
*  So what is the highest version? [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5560.08s)]
*  So imagine if presidents, imagine if big CEOs, imagine if people, thought leaders, these [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5562.08s)]
*  big Twitter celebrities, imagine if they're all being infiltrated with information, but [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5569.08s)]
*  now it's not some handler going, this is what you've got to do, or else. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5577.08s)]
*  Now they think that they're curating these ideas. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5581.08s)]
*  This is, I like this. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5585.08s)]
*  That's wild. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5587.08s)]
*  So that's why you want to shut down a TikTok that you can't control, and you don't want [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5588.08s)]
*  to shut down a Facebook and Instagram, anything on meta, and even maybe Twitter. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5594.08s)]
*  You don't want to shut down someone that aren't cahoots with the government, because social [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5599.08s)]
*  media is not the enemy of the government like we thought it was. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5604.08s)]
*  This is free speech. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5607.08s)]
*  We can actually come together. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5608.08s)]
*  We can organize. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5609.08s)]
*  We can start protests. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5610.08s)]
*  We can do this. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5611.08s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5612.08s)]
*  Social enemy might be a tool, by this theory, a tool of the government to get you to believe [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5613.08s)]
*  whatever it is you want to believe. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5617.08s)]
*  Or no, they want you to believe. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5619.08s)]
*  And it can go even beyond content. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5620.08s)]
*  So let's say you just say a tweet that is controversial. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5621.08s)]
*  You just now have five other tweets below being like, oh, dude, no, you really missed [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5624.08s)]
*  it on this. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5627.08s)]
*  That's actually not true, da, da, da, da. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5628.08s)]
*  And you're like, oh, man, I guess all my followers are saying I'm out of line on this. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5630.08s)]
*  Maybe I should readjust my opinion. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5634.08s)]
*  And all of those bots, all of those accounts are bots paid for by one individual. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5635.08s)]
*  To make you feel like you should or shouldn't have that opinion. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5640.08s)]
*  Now, there was a video, and I forget what the fuck it was. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5645.08s)]
*  I was asking Mark what it was. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5649.08s)]
*  It was either somebody else posted it. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5651.08s)]
*  I don't know if we reacted to it. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5653.08s)]
*  I'm not exactly sure what it was. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5654.08s)]
*  But I looked at the comments of this video, and all the comments were minority women justifying [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5656.08s)]
*  the opinion, the divisive opinion of the person in the video. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5666.08s)]
*  And it was something like, I'm a Latina, but I agree with this sentiment here. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5670.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5674.08s)]
*  Right? [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5675.08s)]
*  I forget what the fucking content of the video was. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5676.08s)]
*  But I saw all the comments, and I was like, a music video or something. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5678.08s)]
*  Try that in a small town. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5682.08s)]
*  Try that in a small town! [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5683.08s)]
*  Yeah, I remember you pointing that out. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5684.08s)]
*  Fucking A up top. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5685.08s)]
*  Because I remember you pointing that out and being like, oh, good. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5686.08s)]
*  You've been taking your liposomal magnesium. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5688.08s)]
*  I have, dude, I have. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5690.08s)]
*  Fucking locked in. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5691.08s)]
*  Okay, so try that in a small town. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5692.08s)]
*  All the comments, the top comments, not all of them, but a lot of the top comments were [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5693.08s)]
*  like, I'm a Latina woman. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5697.08s)]
*  I'm a black woman. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5699.08s)]
*  I agree with this sentiment. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5700.08s)]
*  And then I looked at the YouTube usernames, and all the usernames were the exact same [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5702.08s)]
*  thing. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5710.08s)]
*  It was like, J Martinez and then four numbers. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5711.08s)]
*  Now, I didn't know about this theory, so my initial reaction was like, oh, that's just [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5714.08s)]
*  the username that YouTube gives you when you don't want to try to make one. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5718.08s)]
*  They'll just suggest one. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5721.08s)]
*  But literally every single one was the exact same. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5723.08s)]
*  It was something, four numbers, something, four numbers. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5725.08s)]
*  And maybe that is the case. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5727.08s)]
*  Maybe this is all bullshit, right? [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5728.08s)]
*  But my initial reaction was it feels like the record label sent bots to the music video [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5730.08s)]
*  to thwart any negative reaction in the comments to take control of the narrative. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5739.08s)]
*  So the narrative amongst liberal media was, oh my God, look at this racist thing saying [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5745.08s)]
*  that this is what black people, this is what immigrants or whoever was doing to these small [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5750.08s)]
*  towns, and he's calling for violence against these people, or doing to big towns, and they're [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5754.08s)]
*  calling for violence against the people. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5758.08s)]
*  But the reaction, the comments was, no, this isn't that, and I support this, and I think [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5760.08s)]
*  that this is a good thing. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5765.08s)]
*  You immediately seize the narrative. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5766.08s)]
*  Now, let's say that happened completely organically. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5769.08s)]
*  Sure. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5771.08s)]
*  But if you could do it with bots, what a brilliant thing to do. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5772.08s)]
*  Now, if that's all the comments, not all, we don't know what percentage it is, but all [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5775.08s)]
*  the comments, that's all the views, that's all the accounts, the internet's dead. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5780.08s)]
*  Right now, it isn't. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5786.08s)]
*  Maybe it's a few percent. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5787.08s)]
*  Who the fuck knows? [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5788.08s)]
*  Yeah, the question is where on the scale is it? [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5789.08s)]
*  And it will only get more. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5791.08s)]
*  But if you want to step your dick game up, you want to impress somebody, ladies, you [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5847.08s)]
*  want to be impressed, you want to get better dick, this is the move. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5850.08s)]
*  Go to bluetshrew.com. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5853.08s)]
*  Thank you all, Bluetshrew, for sponsoring this podcast. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5854.08s)]
*  Let's get back to the show. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5856.08s)]
*  All right, guys, we're going to take a break real quick because we've got to talk about [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5857.08s)]
*  something that hopefully you never need, but if you do, you're going to be very happy you [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5860.08s)]
*  know about Morgan & Morgan, our next sponsor. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5863.08s)]
*  If you are wrongfully injured because of the negligence of somebody else, maybe even the [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5866.08s)]
*  maliciousness or malfeasance, I don't know if I use that word correctly, of someone else, [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5871.08s)]
*  that shit sucks. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5875.08s)]
*  You're going to get hurt. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5876.08s)]
*  You're going to have to go to the hospital. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5877.08s)]
*  You're going to have to deal with health insurance. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5878.08s)]
*  It's really fucking hard in every way, being immobilized, dealing with all this stuff. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5880.08s)]
*  But one thing that you could do that would be easy is going to Morgan & Morgan and getting [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5884.08s)]
*  a claim, submitting a claim with Morgan & Morgan is easy. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5887.08s)]
*  And you could be entitled to money. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5890.08s)]
*  And that's where these guys come in. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5892.08s)]
*  Morgan & Morgan is America's largest law firm. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5893.08s)]
*  They have recovered over $20 billion. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5896.08s)]
*  That's more than the motherfucking telegram guy got. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5901.08s)]
*  $20 billion for more than 500,000 clients. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5903.08s)]
*  I mean, it's not one or two big cases floating that 20 billion. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5906.08s)]
*  They have recovered money for quite a few people. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5909.08s)]
*  They have a proven track record of fighting to get you full and fair compensation. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5911.08s)]
*  So again, guys, getting injured because of someone else's negligence is hard to go through. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5915.08s)]
*  But submitting a claim with Morgan & Morgan is easy. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5919.08s)]
*  So if you're ever injured, you can check out Morgan & Morgan. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5922.08s)]
*  And this is important. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5924.08s)]
*  Their fee is free unless they win. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5925.08s)]
*  If they don't win you the case, you don't owe them any fucking money. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5927.08s)]
*  For more information, go to forthepeople.com. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5930.08s)]
*  That is forthepeople.com. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5933.08s)]
*  Or dial pound law. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5935.08s)]
*  That's pound 529 from your cell phone. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5937.08s)]
*  Again, forthepeople.com. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5939.08s)]
*  Or pound law. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5941.08s)]
*  That's the hashtag 529 from your cell phone. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5943.08s)]
*  Guys, this is a paid advertisement, but you knew that already. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5946.08s)]
*  So let's get back to the unpaid party. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5949.08s)]
*  Once more people know that you could take control of a narrative, manipulate a narrative. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5951.08s)]
*  And it will get harder to discern because AI language models are only available on the internet. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5955.08s)]
*  And AI language models are only going to get better and better. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5959.08s)]
*  There's this thing that happens in the real world called gang stalking. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5962.08s)]
*  This is just another version of this that happens in reality. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5966.08s)]
*  And I don't know technically the polite way to say it. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5970.08s)]
*  It seems like it's people that are dealing with paranoid schizophrenia. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5974.08s)]
*  But maybe it happens to some people, I don't know. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5978.08s)]
*  But basically it's this idea that I walk around everywhere and there's people that are following me. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5980.08s)]
*  I walk out of my apartment and there's a car there and I went to work and the same car was parked outside my work. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5985.08s)]
*  And someone or some government is following me around to try to fuck with my head. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5991.08s)]
*  To basically make me stop what I'm doing, to move, to kill myself, whatever. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=5995.08s)]
*  And these people are on these forums, thousands and thousands and thousands of people talking about how they're being gang stalked. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6000.08s)]
*  And they'll like film outside. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6006.08s)]
*  They'll film outside and see cars and they'll be like, five white cars in a row. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6008.08s)]
*  And it just so happened five white cars drove by. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6012.08s)]
*  So I'm not like an expert in this. Maybe there are legitimate cases of gang stalking. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6015.08s)]
*  I don't fucking know. But it seems like certainly some of these people are schizophrenic. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6019.08s)]
*  Now this dead internet theory is basically the internet version of that. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6023.08s)]
*  And now people on the internet are like, oh, I'm being gang stalked by AI. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6028.08s)]
*  But it has a lot more legitimacy because you can't create fake human beings in the real world. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6032.08s)]
*  You can create fake accounts online very easily. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6036.08s)]
*  But now it's like, do I just operate on the internet as like a schizophrenic person? [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6038.08s)]
*  Oh shit. Is this real? Are these bots? [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6042.08s)]
*  I just got a DM like, dude, this video is hilarious. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6044.08s)]
*  And I'm like, who is? Why am I? Like what government is sending? You know what I mean? [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6046.08s)]
*  I think this is actually good if we all subscribe to not putting nearly as much weight on the internet and social media discourse as we do. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6050.08s)]
*  And we all do it. I do it. Like I said, I get positive comments. I love it. I get a negative comment. It fucks with my head. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6058.08s)]
*  If we all were just like, ah, you don't know what's even real out here. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6063.08s)]
*  Don't put that much stock into it with news, with comments, with the racist shit on Twitter or whatever. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6067.08s)]
*  I'm just not going to put that much thought into it. I'm not going to put that much stock into it. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6072.08s)]
*  But do you think I could make those hilarious Indian memes? [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6075.08s)]
*  I don't know if it's possible. If not, they're going to make funnier ones in five years. I don't know. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6078.08s)]
*  We're creative. Some of those are so creative. I mean, the shit was just the map on me and unbelievable. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6082.08s)]
*  So who's after you? Because you've been seeing a lot of anti-semitism in your Twitter. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6089.08s)]
*  I'm like, I'm not seeing any of that in mine. And I'm like, I know we have different tastes, but at the same time, I don't think it would be that different. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6093.08s)]
*  I'm seeing shit now, too. It might just get to you like because you're black. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6100.08s)]
*  What are you seeing in yours? Is there like? [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6104.08s)]
*  It's more just entertainment. But it's like I see a host of people I know. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6106.08s)]
*  Is there no like racism that you're seeing? [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6110.08s)]
*  Very little. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6113.08s)]
*  Do you follow any like, do you follow Elon? [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6114.08s)]
*  Yeah, but like I don't take him serious. He's a joke to me. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6116.08s)]
*  He said something interesting. He tweeted. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6119.08s)]
*  He's like the Twitter algorithm is the idea behind it is we show you things that you want to see and we choose that what you want to see based on what you watch, read or and most importantly, what you share with other people. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6122.08s)]
*  He goes, what we have not accounted for is that you can share things with other people that you despise. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6139.08s)]

*  What Elon is saying is you can interact with content that you don't like and then we are going to serve you more. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6233.08s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6240.08s)]
*  Like when I see gay guys and I'm like, oh, I don't like this. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6241.08s)]
*  But then it serves me more. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6243.08s)]
*  No, you interacted with gay guys that work out a lot enough to the point where they just started sending you gay guys and you still like it. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6244.08s)]
*  You just don't like that. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6253.08s)]
*  They're gay. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6254.08s)]
*  You like that. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6255.08s)]

*  Ladies and gentlemen, we got you. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6259.08s)]
*  You like everything you see. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6262.08s)]
*  You see Hitler. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6266.08s)]
*  You see Hitler and you go, let's see what this guy's talking about. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6267.08s)]
*  I do look at the quotes because everybody says he's a good public speaker, but I never understood it with all the Germans. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6269.08s)]
*  So I'm looking at the bar and how do they get the definition? [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6274.08s)]
*  I just wanted to look. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6277.08s)]
*  Nothing gay about that. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6279.08s)]
*  How big is the print on the speedo? [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6281.08s)]
*  I got to zoom in. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6282.08s)]
*  I was curious. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6283.08s)]
*  Where are they? [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6284.08s)]
*  You're not starting it like this guy sucks and he's evil. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6285.08s)]
*  But you're starting with, whoa, this guy's what is his comp? [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6288.08s)]
*  Because you want to know everything about it. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6293.08s)]
*  You want to know his plan. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6297.08s)]
*  What you're looking for. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6299.08s)]
*  No, I was curious what kind of workouts he was doing. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6301.08s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6303.08s)]
*  That's not gay. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6304.08s)]
*  It's not gay. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6305.08s)]
*  Maybe a guy you're even focusing on the gay part is weird. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6307.08s)]
*  Nobody called me gay. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6310.08s)]
*  You can look at a gay guy working out. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6312.08s)]
*  It's just the workout you look at. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6314.08s)]
*  There's a gay guy playing basketball. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6315.08s)]
*  You deny me gay. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6317.08s)]
*  There's gay guys that act. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6319.08s)]
*  You just watch them as an actor. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6320.08s)]
*  It's all right. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6321.08s)]
*  It's OK. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6322.08s)]
*  I might have fixed it. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6325.08s)]
*  What? [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6327.08s)]
*  This is your tabloid? [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6328.08s)]
*  This is the current export page. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6329.08s)]
*  This is your non-burner? [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6330.08s)]
*  My Instagram ain't bad at all. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6332.08s)]
*  Twitter is the cesspool. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6333.08s)]
*  That's the thing. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6335.08s)]
*  I don't share any of this shit. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6336.08s)]
*  I don't get it shared with me. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6337.08s)]
*  So why is it all of a sudden this like. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6338.08s)]
*  Oh, no, I share stuff. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6340.08s)]
*  Yeah, but no, it's well. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6341.08s)]
*  Maybe you don't share it. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6343.08s)]
*  That's what they're saying. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6344.08s)]
*  If you just watch it at all, that counts as like a point. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6345.08s)]
*  Sharing, what he said is sharing counts the most towards the algorithm. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6348.08s)]
*  But what I think they've realized is you oftentimes share the worst things, [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6351.08s)]
*  the things you disagree with the most. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6355.08s)]
*  If somebody says something awful about you or a group you care about. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6357.08s)]
*  Look how fucked up this is. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6360.08s)]
*  Say again? [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6361.08s)]
*  Look how fucked up this is. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6362.08s)]
*  Look how fucked up this is. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6363.08s)]
*  You don't want to see more of it. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6364.08s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6365.08s)]
*  But their algorithm is going, oh, they really like this content. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6366.08s)]
*  Let's serve it up. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6368.08s)]
*  So they're like, this is a fuck up and we got to find a way to fix it. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6370.08s)]
*  But I don't know if that's 100 percent true because the goal of the app is to get you to stay on the app. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6373.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6379.08s)]
*  So if you are sharing things, you're on the app. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6380.08s)]
*  Now your friends are also on the app. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6382.08s)]
*  So they want to give you the things they're making even more people interact. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6384.08s)]
*  They're incentivized to keep you at all costs. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6387.08s)]
*  So they might be saying, oh, we got to fix that. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6388.08s)]
*  But then your experience on the app is less engaging and you might tap out. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6390.08s)]
*  By showing them puppies they're on for an hour. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6395.08s)]
*  By showing them war footage they're on for an hour and a half. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6397.08s)]
*  How long do you watch the Paralympics with other little like songs and other little things that they put into it? [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6399.08s)]
*  A long time. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6403.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6404.08s)]
*  If you just show the person doing the thing without the cartoon music. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6405.08s)]
*  My cartoon musicals, wow. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6410.08s)]
*  Or was it? [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6412.08s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6413.08s)]
*  These people are nuts. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6415.08s)]
*  I'm not even going to that adult circus, right? [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6417.08s)]
*  That's what I remind you. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6420.08s)]

*  Why was he part of it? [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6912.679999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6913.679999999999s)]
*  He was in Europe. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6914.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he was in Europe off that Chase Bank money scam. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6915.679999999999s)]
*  No, what is the Chase Bank scam? [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6917.679999999999s)]
*  Because that was occupying black Twitter for most of the weekend. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6919.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6922.679999999999s)]
*  It was a couple of days, but it wasn't a big scam. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6923.679999999999s)]
*  It's what a weekend is. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6925.679999999999s)]
*  I know. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6929.679999999999s)]
*  It was a slew of days. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6930.679999999999s)]
*  A slew of days happened all back to back to back. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6931.679999999999s)]
*  One day, another day. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6936.679999999999s)]
*  It's like, how many days are we even going to have? [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6937.88s)]
*  The fuck's even happened with all these slews and days? [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6940.88s)]
*  Okay, can you tell us about this scam? [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6943.88s)]
*  So the little I know about it is just you'll have a ringleader and they'll make you open [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6946.88s)]
*  up a new account at Chase and then you have to give them your checks that you got from [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6951.68s)]
*  opening a new account. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6956.96s)]
*  They give you checks that they got from someone else, any amount of money on it. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6958.280000000001s)]
*  Once they deposit it in that account, Chase approves like a certain portion of that check [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6962.76s)]
*  and then they can deposit it real quick. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6967.48s)]
*  Withdraw it real quick. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6969.28s)]
*  Withdraw it real quick. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6970.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6971.28s)]
*  And then they're all idiots because once the check doesn't clear, then Chase is like, [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6972.28s)]
*  we need our money back. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6976.28s)]
*  This is bank fraud. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6977.28s)]
*  It's just fraud. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6978.28s)]
*  This is bank. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6979.28s)]
*  And it's very traceable. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6980.28s)]
*  That's the thing. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6981.28s)]
*  It's the dumbest thing. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6982.28s)]
*  It's very traceable. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6983.28s)]
*  I know. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6984.28s)]
*  I feel that way too. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6985.28s)]
*  I think the Explorers... [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6986.28s)]
*  You guys are past this. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6987.28s)]
*  I know. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6988.28s)]
*  You guys are past this. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6989.28s)]
*  This is not good. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6990.28s)]
*  I know. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6991.28s)]
*  It's bad. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6992.28s)]
*  It's bad. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6993.28s)]
*  What is... [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6994.28s)]
*  I wish you didn't even bring it up there. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6995.28s)]
*  It's on the tongue of my ass. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6997.08s)]
*  I know. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=6999.08s)]
*  I don't understand. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7000.08s)]
*  I'm so confused that people thought they would get away with it. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7001.08s)]
*  I was in Hawaii. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7004.08s)]
*  I'm kind of removed. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7005.08s)]
*  And then I'm seeing all these people defrauding Chase. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7006.08s)]
*  I'm like, what's going on? [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7008.08s)]
*  Maybe there's money to be made. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7009.08s)]
*  And I see what they're doing. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7010.08s)]
*  And I'm like, well, you're just going to jail. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7011.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7012.08s)]
*  This is insane. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7013.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7014.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7015.08s)]
*  It's the worst type of crap too because it's federal wire fraud. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7016.08s)]
*  They've been doing it for years. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7019.08s)]
*  Guaranteed. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7020.08s)]
*  I think they're putting videos of themselves online. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7021.08s)]
*  What in the f**king world is that? [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7023.08s)]
*  What in the f**king world is that? [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7024.08s)]
*  I think Chase was giving almost the full amount. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7025.08s)]
*  That was the... [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7027.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7028.08s)]
*  Because most banks will hold 90 percent, but I think Chase was just clearing... [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7029.08s)]
*  It was like a glitch. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7033.08s)]
*  That was a glitch. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7034.08s)]
*  And that's why they're calling it infinite money glitch. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7035.08s)]
*  Gotcha. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7037.08s)]
*  Okay. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7038.08s)]
*  And so you deposit $50,000 and get $50,000. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7039.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7040.08s)]
*  Yeah, some guy got like $800,000 and he thinks he's going to get away with it. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7041.08s)]
*  Wow. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7044.08s)]
*  He showed his balance with like $100 one day or whatever and then $894,000 or something. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7045.08s)]
*  And it's like, okay, buddy, good luck with this. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7050.08s)]
*  I'm going to flee the f**king country with this money. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7053.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7055.08s)]
*  That's what they should have done. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7056.08s)]
*  Low key. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7057.08s)]
*  I mean... [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7058.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7059.08s)]
*  Yeah, you say you got a million, you moved to Thailand, you're good. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7060.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7061.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7062.08s)]
*  Then you got to get all that cash out. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7063.08s)]
*  Nah, you withdrew. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7064.08s)]
*  You withdrew. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7065.08s)]
*  You're good. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7066.08s)]
*  Maybe you can't fly with more than $10,000. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7067.08s)]
*  I mean, they got to check. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7068.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7069.08s)]
*  Are they going to check? [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7070.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7071.08s)]
*  Wait, what do you mean? [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7072.08s)]
*  Haven't you seen Wolf of Wall Street? [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7073.08s)]
*  You can fly. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7074.08s)]
*  They'll just check to see if you have it. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7075.08s)]
*  Yeah, but you haven't seen a million dollars in cash. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7078.08s)]
*  That's a lot of f**king money. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7080.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7081.08s)]
*  I don't know if it's as big as we think it is. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7083.08s)]
*  Yeah, I said that and I have no idea what that looks like. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7084.08s)]
*  Because I think in our mind it was like these huge... [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7085.08s)]
*  Yeah, I said that and I have no idea what that looks like. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7086.08s)]
*  In my mind it was like giant duffel bags that you're walking out of the banquet with, but [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7087.08s)]
*  I think a million dollars in $100 bills... [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7095.08s)]
*  Yeah, there's a scene in... [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7098.08s)]
*  This has some 20s in it. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7099.08s)]
*  But that has 20s. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7100.08s)]
*  Show me one million in a hundred... [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7101.08s)]
*  There it is. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7103.08s)]
*  That's a suitcase. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7104.08s)]
*  So a silver suitcase is a million dollars in a hundred... [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7105.08s)]
*  Mr. B showed me this. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7109.08s)]
*  But they still scan it, right? [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7110.08s)]
*  What, your suitcase? [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7112.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7113.08s)]
*  Well, it depends. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7114.08s)]
*  If you do check luggage, then well, they're not scanning it. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7115.08s)]
*  They just throw it on the plane. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7117.08s)]
*  Don't those get scanned too? [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7118.08s)]
*  Because how do people just put coke in the s**t and just... [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7120.08s)]
*  They do. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7123.08s)]
*  That's where they put their coke. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7124.08s)]
*  No. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7125.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7126.08s)]
*  I don't think it's that easy, guys. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7127.08s)]
*  It's an infinite flying glitch. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7129.08s)]
*  It's the infinite flying glitch. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7132.08s)]
*  You know the electronic equipment we put on a plane every single week and never get asked [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7134.08s)]
*  about it? [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7138.08s)]
*  They don't care about that. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7139.08s)]
*  I'm saying if you have a whole suitcase full of money, it's got to go through a TSA scan [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7140.08s)]
*  or something, I'll look at it and be like, oh, what the f**k is that? [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7143.08s)]
*  If you check the bag... [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7145.08s)]
*  I think they... [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7146.08s)]
*  Yeah, they got caught. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7147.08s)]
*  They scan the check bag. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7148.08s)]
*  I don't check bags. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7149.08s)]
*  Son, that's times where you open your bag and they put a little thing in it and say, hey, [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7150.08s)]
*  we went through your s**t. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7153.08s)]
*  Nah, nah, nah. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7154.08s)]
*  Take it to your body, yo. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7155.08s)]
*  I know. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7156.08s)]
*  What the f**k are you talking about? [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7157.08s)]
*  Okay, actually... [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7158.08s)]
*  Since I've been traveling with Shifty, that's never happened to me. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7159.08s)]
*  That's never happened to me. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7164.08s)]
*  I was on it. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7165.08s)]
*  I was on it. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7166.08s)]
*  That's never happened to me. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7168.08s)]
*  I was on it. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7169.08s)]
*  Technically, Andrew's right. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7170.08s)]
*  Yes, all checked bags are scanned by the TSA. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7172.08s)]
*  TSA is required by law to screen all checked bags on commercial flights. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7175.08s)]
*  So there you go. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7178.08s)]
*  You're right. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7180.08s)]
*  Thanks. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7181.08s)]
*  That looked like that. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7183.08s)]
*  Sometimes it's all... [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7184.08s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's all... [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7185.08s)]
*  Of course they're going to say that. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7186.08s)]
*  You f**king idiots. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7189.08s)]
*  What do you think they're going to like throw a bomb in your checked luggage and nobody [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7190.08s)]
*  will find it? [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7193.08s)]
*  Of course they said it, but that's where you can put your guns, that's where you can [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7194.08s)]
*  put your knives, that's where you can put anything you want. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7197.08s)]
*  They're not going to look for it. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7199.08s)]
*  In the crime glitch. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7200.08s)]
*  Yes. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7201.08s)]
*  I think for a moment he really doesn't check bags. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7202.08s)]
*  They don't. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7205.08s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7206.08s)]
*  That moment is still... [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7207.08s)]
*  You're a f**king idiot. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7208.08s)]
*  That moment exists in perpetuity. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7209.08s)]
*  How? [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7211.08s)]
*  How they go check every bag? [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7212.08s)]
*  How? [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7214.08s)]
*  How? [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7215.08s)]
*  How many people are employed at TSA to check every single bag? [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7216.08s)]
*  You know how long it takes me to pack my bag? [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7220.08s)]
*  Pack it? [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7222.08s)]
*  Unpack it? [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7223.08s)]
*  Yeah, do you know mine? [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7224.08s)]
*  Try something on it? [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7225.08s)]
*  The scanner doesn't show up unmarked bills. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7226.08s)]
*  Sorry. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7229.08s)]
*  All you got to do is wrap the unmarked bills in a couple hoodies and it just shows a hoody. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7230.08s)]
*  It can't go through and then through again. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7237.08s)]
*  I believe you can get a million dollars in, fairly. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7240.08s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7242.08s)]
*  You're a f**king idiot. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7243.08s)]
*  You know I traveled one time... [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7244.08s)]
*  You're not supposed to be smart. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7245.08s)]
*  I snuck money into America. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7246.08s)]
*  I traveled one time with weed gummies. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7249.08s)]
*  I have both things zipped and I'm running late. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7250.08s)]
*  Look at that. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7251.08s)]
*  I just throw it in the middle. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7252.08s)]
*  Look at that. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7253.08s)]
*  I got a flyer from TSA said they searched my suitcase. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7254.08s)]
*  It's right next to the weed gummies. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7259.08s)]
*  Nothing happened. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7260.08s)]
*  See? [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7261.08s)]
*  They don't even search it. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7262.08s)]
*  I think they just threw the shit in there and they get back up. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7263.08s)]
*  See? [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7264.08s)]
*  See? [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7265.08s)]
*  Apologize. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7266.08s)]
*  They don't care about your weed gummies. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7267.08s)]
*  They care about millions of... [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7268.08s)]
*  Oh shut up, Mark. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7269.08s)]
*  That's not a federal crime. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7270.08s)]
*  That's not federally illegal. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7271.08s)]
*  That's not federally illegal. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7272.08s)]
*  Y'all believe that? [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7273.08s)]
*  That was federally illegal. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7274.08s)]
*  He believes that this is a real thing. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7275.08s)]
*  This is Shull's bag. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7276.08s)]
*  That's a real Photoshop. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7277.08s)]
*  That's a picture of Andrew Shultz's bag. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7279.08s)]
*  That's a real Photoshop. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7280.08s)]
*  That's a picture of Andrew Shultz's... [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7281.08s)]
*  A grenade. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7282.08s)]
*  Yeah, this is a handcuff. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7283.08s)]
*  This is Andrew. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7284.08s)]
*  I'm not racing. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7285.08s)]
*  This is Andrew's bag when you go into Tucson, Arizona. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7286.08s)]
*  Here's what I'm saying. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7287.08s)]
*  Do you guys even know how... [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7288.08s)]
*  What is this shit called? [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7289.08s)]
*  Infrared, x-ray? [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7290.08s)]
*  Do you guys even know how x-ray works? [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7291.08s)]
*  How does it work? [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7292.08s)]
*  This is how it works. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7293.08s)]
*  It could only go through two layers. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7294.08s)]
*  Okay? [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7295.08s)]
*  So it goes through the layer that is the bag, so that's penetrating one layer, and then it [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7296.08s)]
*  goes one layer past that. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7297.08s)]
*  Okay? [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7298.08s)]
*  So it goes through the layer that is the bag, so that's penetrating one layer, and then it [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7299.08s)]
*  It goes through the layer that is the bag, so that's penetrating one layer, and then it [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7300.08s)]
*  goes one layer past that. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7305.08s)]
*  That's stuff in the bag. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7308.08s)]
*  No, no, now you're in the bag. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7309.08s)]
*  Now you're in the bag. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7310.08s)]
*  Now you're in the bag, right? [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7311.08s)]
*  Right? [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7312.08s)]
*  And then you have like a sweater or something like that. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7313.08s)]
*  It goes through that sweater. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7316.08s)]
*  If you put another layer over the money, that's three layers. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7318.08s)]
*  It cannot go that far. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7320.08s)]
*  That's three layers. It cannot go that far. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7323.08s)]
*  The money's layered on itself. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7325.92s)]
*  It cannot go that far. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7327.42s)]
*  They look at it, they go, oh. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7328.42s)]
*  They might even get one layer. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7329.42s)]
*  He has one. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7330.42s)]
*  They get one layer. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7331.42s)]
*  He has $100. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7332.42s)]
*  He has $100. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7333.42s)]
*  Because that state, how could it see through all of it? [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7334.42s)]
*  It can't count. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7335.42s)]
*  Do you think the X-ray infrared can count out? [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7336.42s)]
*  No. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7338.72s)]
*  This guy's got $20. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7339.72s)]
*  Broke boy. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7340.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7341.72s)]
*  That's what it seems. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7342.72s)]
*  Yeah, so they know there's $100 behind it. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7343.72s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7344.72s)]
*  They can't count the layers. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7345.72s)]
*  But it's about the layers, dude. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7346.72s)]
*  It can't go through layers. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7347.72s)]
*  Yes. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7348.72s)]
*  If it kept going through layers, it would just see the bottom. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7349.72s)]
*  I hate you. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7351.72s)]

*  But they're not taking a delta flight. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7589.28s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7590.28s)]
*  You can figure it out. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7591.28s)]
*  That's my point. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7592.28s)]
*  If you got a million and you left the country, you could figure it out. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7593.28s)]
*  That's a good point because you got the cash. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7595.28s)]
*  How do you pay for a jet in cash? [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7597.28s)]
*  That's going to be tricky because they're going to immediately assume something crazy. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7599.28s)]
*  Gift cards. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7601.92s)]
*  You buy a lot of gift cards. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7604.52s)]
*  You say these are good at Barnes and Noble. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7605.52s)]
*  How do you even get the cash? [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7607.52s)]
*  How do you get the million dollars out the bank? [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7608.52s)]
*  Also, it's three feet tall. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7610.52s)]
*  Because the ATM dispenses it. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7611.52s)]
*  You do your check. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7614.200000000001s)]
*  Once you ask for more than 10,000, then the bank takes you to another room. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7615.200000000001s)]
*  And then you have to count the shit. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7619.200000000001s)]
*  They have to wait. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7620.200000000001s)]
*  They have to check, make sure the shit is okay. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7621.200000000001s)]
*  You get a bunch of ATMs, y'all. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7622.200000000001s)]

*  It's a glitch. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7624.200000000001s)]
*  It's an infinite money glitch. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7625.200000000001s)]
*  I thought ATMs were done. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7626.200000000001s)]
*  I'll be honest. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7627.200000000001s)]
*  I thought ATMs were done. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7628.200000000001s)]

*  If I didn't say that before, that is fire. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7644.88s)]
*  Because ATMs are done for this reason. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7648.2s)]
*  For this reason alone. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7650.88s)]
*  You're just a little ahead of it. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7651.88s)]
*  I was ahead of it. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7653.32s)]

*  He goes, it has to be inside. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7740.08s)]
*  It has to be inside joke. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7742.08s)]
*  It has to be inside joke. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7744.08s)]
*  One trillion dollars of wealth go away in the other building. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7746.08s)]
*  This can't be from the outside. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7750.08s)]
*  I go, I guess we'll never know. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7752.16s)]

*  Outside joke is fine. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7760.16s)]
*  I remember this. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7761.16s)]
*  So good. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7762.16s)]
*  Bro. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7763.16s)]
*  Conspiracies got to Puerto Rico. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7764.16s)]
*  So I had this thought. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7766.16s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7767.16s)]
*  It is proof that the conspiracy, the anti-establishment conspiracy theorist is now just completely [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7768.16s)]
*  ubiquitous. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7777.16s)]
*  We've talked about this on the pod a little bit, but it is now widely accepted by any [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7778.24s)]
*  individual. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7783.24s)]
*  You had to be somewhat fringe to even seek out that information back in the day. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7784.24s)]
*  Now it is, he looked at me like I was crazy for even thinking that it could have been [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7789.24s)]
*  something that was planned by a foreign government that we had nothing to do with. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7795.24s)]
*  Wild, right? [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7798.24s)]
*  Had been outside the dairy talk. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7799.24s)]
*  So what are the repercussions of that? [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7801.24s)]
*  January 6th, everyone's waking up. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7803.24s)]
*  Yeah, you don't trust anything ever. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7805.24s)]
*  But that's the thing. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7807.32s)]
*  October 6th. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7808.32s)]
*  January 1st. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7809.32s)]
*  October 6th. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7810.32s)]
*  The ball's dropping. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7811.32s)]
*  Watch out. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7812.32s)]
*  What is it like? [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7813.32s)]
*  No one trusts anything ever. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7816.32s)]
*  No one trusts everything ever. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7818.32s)]
*  And then I wonder if there's like a version where, hmm, I don't know. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7820.32s)]
*  I got to think on this a little bit more. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7827.32s)]
*  But yeah, no one trusts anything ever. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7829.32s)]
*  But I actually, that's what I assumed it was, right? [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7830.32s)]
*  I was like, that's the end game. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7832.32s)]
*  It's like no one trusts everything ever. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7833.32s)]
*  I actually don't think it's that. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7835.32s)]
*  I think that more people trust the most salacious thing that they've read. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7836.4s)]
*  Right? [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7843.4s)]
*  I actually think it starts to flip. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7844.4s)]
*  Like I think like the conspiracy theorists, once it becomes calmly accepted in everybody, [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7845.4s)]
*  to find some version of truth that nobody knows about because that is a thing that's like addictive, [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7850.4s)]
*  is they start not trusting anything. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7855.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7858.4s)]
*  And then the regular people, the everyday people, start trusting every conspiracy. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7859.4s)]
*  We didn't go to the moon. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7865.48s)]
*  We didn't do these things. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7866.48s)]
*  But they blindly trust it. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7867.48s)]
*  And now that they feel that they're lied to, and they have been lied to, any piece of information [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7869.48s)]
*  that is consistent with like government organization, a big corporation lying, they immediately [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7873.48s)]
*  subscribe and believe. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7879.48s)]
*  I think you also get like North stars of truth. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7880.48s)]
*  People all have different sort of like truth finders or tellers. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7884.48s)]
*  And they only trust their person. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7888.48s)]
*  So if someone goes, no, this is the truth, 20% of the population trusts that guy. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7890.48s)]
*  20% trust another person and so on. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7894.5599999999995s)]
*  So there's like four or five quote unquote truths. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7897.5599999999995s)]
*  And now you've got to unradicalize all these people who are seeking that North star in [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7900.5599999999995s)]
*  someone who's feeding them conspiracy theories. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7904.5599999999995s)]
*  So it's like you have to unravel their addiction to conspiracy. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7907.5599999999995s)]
*  And it is hyper addictive. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7911.5599999999995s)]
*  Like it's so awesome to learn about it. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7913.5599999999995s)]
*  Right? [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7915.5599999999995s)]
*  Like I've gone through this probably a hundred times in this podcast from the Fed to fucking, [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7916.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't know, what else? [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7921.5599999999995s)]
*  Pavel Dorov. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7922.5599999999995s)]
*  Whatever. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7923.64s)]
*  Disney shit when you were like a kid. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7924.64s)]
*  Remember Disney lies. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7926.64s)]
*  That was awesome. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7927.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7928.64s)]
*  So yes, that's a tricky one. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7929.64s)]
*  I wonder what the effects on society of that are. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7931.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7935.64s)]
*  It's like, okay, you know how like you can speak about religion and hopefully this doesn't [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7936.64s)]
*  seem reductive, but like whether or not you believe it to be true, it has served people [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7940.64s)]
*  well in terms of organizing them, organizing behavior, creating like punitive measures [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7946.64s)]
*  for behavior that's not good for an organized society. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7950.72s)]
*  Like it has held humanity together. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7954.72s)]
*  Maybe it hasn't, but we at least, at least I at least give it some credit for doing that [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7956.72s)]
*  based on things that may or may not be true. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7960.72s)]
*  We've just subscribed to them. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7963.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7965.72s)]
*  And because of that, it holds humanity together. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7966.72s)]
*  Right? [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7969.72s)]
*  Is that a fair assessment? [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7970.72s)]
*  Okay, let's build on that. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7971.72s)]
*  So and not to be insulting to any religion, but let's just say every religion believes [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7973.72s)]
*  the other one is lying about something. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7979.8s)]
*  Right? [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7981.8s)]
*  So these quote unquote lies or not guaranteed truths are holding society together. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7982.8s)]
*  So if that's not religion, let's say that that is government propaganda or whatever [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7991.8s)]
*  it is, that has also played a role in holding society together. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7994.8s)]
*  That is the religion of the nation, if you will. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=7998.8s)]
*  What happens when there is a complete breakdown of the religion of the nation? [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8001.8s)]
*  What happens when there's a breakdown of the religion that is the religion and the religion [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8006.88s)]
*  of the nation? [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8009.88s)]
*  Like what happens to that? [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8010.88s)]
*  What happens to these people who are just now wracked with anxiety because they don't [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8012.88s)]
*  believe in their God and they don't believe in their government? [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8015.88s)]
*  Fuck. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8022.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8023.88s)]
*  Now you're just hooked up on pills nonstop. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8024.88s)]
*  Maybe that's the conspiracy. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8026.88s)]
*  Maybe the pharmaceutical companies don't want you to believe in God and don't want you to [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8028.88s)]
*  believe in the government narrative and they just want you to sit there and be anxious [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8032.88s)]
*  so you can be on Prozac all day. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8035.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8037.96s)]
*  Again. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8038.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8039.96s)]
*  I do think that the ability to make conspiracies is a way to sort of pacify cognitive dissonance [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8040.96s)]
*  with a large fraction of the population. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8048.96s)]
*  I believe a specific thing. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8051.96s)]
*  The government lies, if that is your thing, or I'm a Republican or I'm a Democrat, and [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8053.96s)]
*  then anything that sort of goes against that, the availability of information and narrative [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8057.96s)]
*  writing by conspiracy theorists or people that come up with alternative theories is [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8063.04s)]
*  a way to ameliorate that feeling of like, oh, this can't be true. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8068.04s)]
*  And I think people have always had that. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8071.04s)]
*  The internet has just given us access to it. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8072.04s)]
*  I think the feeling of like, oh, this president got assassinated. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8074.04s)]
*  What's the conspiracy? [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8077.04s)]
*  That's always been around since forever it seems like. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8078.04s)]
*  But I just think the internet has given people access to all the information. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8082.04s)]
*  And then we're also now aware that the government lies to us all the time. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8087.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8090.04s)]
*  I think that's true. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8091.04s)]
*  I think that creates a ton of distrust where people are like, all right, I will never believe [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8092.12s)]
*  anything. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8096.12s)]
*  Whatever you say is the opposite. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8097.12s)]
*  Now you have an issue on a scratch. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8098.12s)]
*  And every piece of information that helps you scratch it is a piece of information that [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8099.12s)]
*  you're going to digest and you're going to probably believe wholeheartedly. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8102.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8105.24s)]
*  Or at least give a little credence to. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8106.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8108.24s)]
*  Ooh. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8109.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8110.24s)]
*  I'm saying like, what is the... [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8111.24s)]
*  Assuming that this doesn't change, and I think that the pendulum do swing a year from now, [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8112.24s)]
*  after the election, it could be completely like neutered version of what this is. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8116.24s)]
*  But let's say it doesn't, it just gets crazier and crazier. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8121.8s)]
*  What does that map out to 10 years from now? [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8123.8s)]
*  Like, where is the faith? [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8127.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8129.8s)]
*  Because I think we do crave that. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8132.8s)]
*  We crave order. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8134.8s)]
*  We crave understanding. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8135.8s)]
*  I think it goes back to religiosity. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8137.8s)]
*  I think it goes back to things that are infallible and sort of undemunctable. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8139.8s)]
*  That'd be great. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8143.8s)]
*  So this is actually really interesting. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8146.8s)]
*  Depends. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8147.8s)]
*  Well, it depends on the religion, of course, right? [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8149.68s)]
*  But this is interesting. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8151.68s)]
*  We know that corporations will lie. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8154.68s)]
*  We know that governments will lie. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8155.68s)]
*  We know that just people in power in general will probably lie. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8157.68s)]
*  God doesn't lie. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8162.68s)]
*  Whether or not these things that he's saying have happened, he doesn't lie. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8165.68s)]
*  And in a world of lies, it might be comforting to choose to believe in that truth, because [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8171.68s)]
*  there's no way to prove it wrong. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8179.56s)]
*  Like, you can use some sort of logic and go, ah, well, this couldn't have happened at [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8181.56s)]
*  this date because yada yada yada. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8184.56s)]
*  But the idea of humanity that is given to you by the grace of God, if you choose to [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8186.56s)]
*  submit yourself to that, is infallible. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8193.56s)]
*  And that might just be more comforting in a world full of things that you've kind of [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8196.56s)]
*  chosen not to believe in any of them. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8202.56s)]
*  So maybe it is a return to religiosity simply for the comfort, not even heaven. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8204.56s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8209.56s)]
*  Doesn't God lie to Adam about what? [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8212.56s)]
*  And Eve, he says, don't eat this apple, it'll kill you. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8215.56s)]
*  No, he says, don't eat it because then you'll possess the knowledge of good and evil or [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8218.56s)]
*  something. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8223.56s)]
*  I thought he said it'll kill you. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8224.56s)]
*  Ignorance is bliss is what he's trying to say. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8225.56s)]
*  Oh, no, and then I think there's something to the effect of, and then you will die, which [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8228.56s)]
*  basically is like that humanity is now capable of death, where I think Adam and Eve were. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8233.56s)]
*  You're always capping for your boy, huh? [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8238.56s)]
*  Just fucking stand up for him. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8240.56s)]
*  Not only my boy, dude, Jews boys, Muzzy's boys. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8242.56s)]
*  The boy. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8245.56s)]
*  That's true. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8246.56s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8247.56s)]
*  I don't know, I'm gonna look into that shit. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8248.56s)]
*  We're all son of Adam miles. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8249.56s)]
*  Listen, you can find a million lies. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8250.56s)]
*  I'm sure you can find a million, what is it called? [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8253.56s)]
*  I was trying to pin mark there. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8256.56s)]
*  There's so many different ways that you can pin them. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8258.56s)]
*  No, you can't. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8260.56s)]
*  When it comes to religion, of course. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8261.56s)]
*  Unfortunately, the one holy catholic and apostolic church has got that. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8262.56s)]
*  The only guy that can pin Catholicism are the priests. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8267.56s)]
*  Even that shit. [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8270.56s)]
*  Yeah, fakeness. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8272.56s)]
*  Fakeness? [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8274.56s)]
*  I don't think people go back towards the church. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8275.56s)]
*  I think people just get more and more disconnected and stop caring about what's happening in the world. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8278.56s)]
*  Everybody just lives in their isolated bubble. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8284.56s)]
*  I can't think that's great, dude. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8287.56s)]
*  All I care about is my home and my family. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8288.56s)]
*  That's 10 to your garden, that's it. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8289.56s)]
*  Segregate, separate, equal. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8291.56s)]
*  I think that is. [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8293.56s)]
*  I mean, in theory, that's a great idea. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8294.56s)]
*  It's a great idea. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8296.56s)]
*  It's just it wasn't equal. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8297.56s)]
*  It was communism. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8298.56s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8299.56s)]
*  So then what dictates your ethics when you're tending to your garden? [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8300.56s)]
*  What makes you feel good. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8304.56s)]
*  Simply speaking, what makes you feel good is what got us here in the first place. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8306.56s)]
*  In what way? [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8311.56s)]
*  What do you mean? [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8313.56s)]
*  Like indulgences. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8314.56s)]
*  I think the root of almost every religion is to push back on indulgence. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8315.56s)]
*  Maybe to simplify all religion to that is reductive, but there's not a doubt that every single religion from Buddhism to Christianity. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8321.56s)]
*  Yeah, Eastern faith for sure is overcome your senses and everything your senses wants. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8329.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8333.56s)]
*  But I'm saying what makes you feel good in like morally, not just. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8334.56s)]
*  But where are those morals based on? [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8338.56s)]
*  Like if we remove Abrahamic religions, we remove Eastern philosophy, like what is it based on? [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8340.56s)]
*  I think the problem is oftentimes you might gravitate towards doing what makes you feel good and oftentimes doing what makes you feel good in the moment makes you feel like shit the next day or days after. [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8345.56s)]
*  And the discipline required to like live a life that makes you feel good is to reject the things that are indulgent in the immediate future. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8355.56s)]
*  Sometimes like, you know, having some if we just get fucking drunk, it's gonna make us feel good. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8365.56s)]
*  But like the next day we're gonna pay for that shit. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8370.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8372.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8373.56s)]
*  But it's a weird thing. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8374.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8376.56s)]
*  Maybe you grew up with this, Mark. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8377.56s)]
*  You're younger than us. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8379.56s)]
*  But like my generation, we just implicitly trusted what the government told us, what the history books told us. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8380.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8386.56s)]
*  Like I had a history teacher in middle school, Mr. Davis, that told like taught like a somewhat alternative version of the Civil War and like somewhat for back then standards, not even close to the way that it was. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8387.56s)]
*  Not even close to right now. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8402.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8403.56s)]
*  But he did this thing about like it wasn't about slavery, it was about states' rights. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8404.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8408.56s)]
*  Which now is a very commonly understood, you know, take on. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8409.56s)]
*  It was a states' rights owned slaves. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8412.56s)]
*  But it's still the states' rights issue. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8414.56s)]
*  And this is important for the foundation of America because we are a bunch of states that should be able to determine their laws and blah, blah, blah. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8416.56s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8422.56s)]
*  But I remember learning that in that class. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8423.56s)]
*  What? [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8425.56s)]
*  Like some shit that we were taught wasn't exactly what this guy's on it. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8426.56s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8431.56s)]
*  That was conspiracy almost. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8432.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8434.56s)]
*  And that's how much we just trusted everything. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8435.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8438.56s)]
*  And now I feel like every class could be littered with that. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8439.56s)]
*  Every war. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8444.56s)]
*  Every conflict. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8446.56s)]
*  I mean, the fact that we teach now in school that like we just fake blew up a boat to get us into Vietnam is insane, right? [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8448.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8457.56s)]
*  Like it's a crazy. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8458.56s)]
*  Is that song in school? [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8459.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8460.56s)]
*  Oh really? [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8461.56s)]
*  That's a lot. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8462.56s)]
*  Wow. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8463.56s)]
*  That's great. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8464.56s)]
*  That's great. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8465.56s)]
*  My bad. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8466.56s)]
*  The government just said my bad. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8467.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8468.56s)]
*  What does that do to you even as a kid? [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8469.56s)]
*  Like you lose faith in the institution as well. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8472.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8474.56s)]
*  Yeah, but then you're more realistic and like honest about what it is. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8476.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8479.56s)]
*  It also like makes it like a precedent to keep governments accountable. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8480.56s)]
*  Like, oh, you're going to be taught in the history books for what you actually did. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8485.56s)]
*  That you actually did a false flag to basically like create this thing. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8488.56s)]
*  Maybe that is a good point. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8491.56s)]
*  Maybe when we keep governments accountable, they'll try to pull off less of the false flags. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8492.56s)]
*  You would hope. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8497.56s)]
*  Inshallah. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8498.56s)]
*  Inshallah. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8499.56s)]
*  But yeah. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8500.56s)]
*  That's kind of my approach is like I like seeking out conspiracies with the mindset [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8501.56s)]
*  of like, this is bullshit and I'm going to figure out why. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8505.56s)]
*  And then you start reading something and you're like, oh, this part is actually true. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8508.56s)]
*  But then these three parts are bullshit. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8512.56s)]
*  Or you read some shit and you're like, oh, this is just 100% true. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8513.56s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8515.56s)]
*  Hmm. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8516.56s)]
*  That's kind of fun because then you get to indulge in the conspiracy, which is just really [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8517.56s)]
*  fun content. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8520.56s)]
*  And then you try to steel man it. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8521.56s)]
*  And if you can't, if you can't, if you're like, yo, if I could successfully steel man [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8522.56s)]
*  it, then maybe it's true. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8526.56s)]
*  So we go to the moon or what? [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8527.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8529.56s)]
*  I think probably. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8530.56s)]
*  I think we went. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8531.56s)]
*  I think probably. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8532.56s)]
*  But I think some of the footage might be Fugazi. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8533.56s)]
*  Yeah, I think all of it is. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8535.56s)]
*  But I think they did go. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8536.56s)]
*  Because can't you see the tracks of the rover to this day? [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8537.56s)]
*  No, no. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8541.56s)]
*  Like I think NASA has like an open information policy. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8542.56s)]
*  So I think that you there are still there's still remnants of our trip to the moon. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8545.56s)]
*  Oh yeah, there are. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8551.56s)]
*  I mean, there's a flag. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8552.56s)]
*  You should be able to see all of it. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8553.56s)]
*  There's no wind up there. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8554.56s)]
*  Sorry? [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8555.56s)]
*  There's no wind or anything to like the rover. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8556.56s)]
*  Right. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8557.56s)]
*  So I think if we can move the atmosphere is going to be the exact same. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8558.56s)]
*  So if we can still see the tracks, if we can still see all this evidence, then why would [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8560.56s)]
*  we? [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8564.56s)]
*  I think there's a laser on the moon. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8565.56s)]
*  Done it after the fact. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8567.56s)]
*  Say again? [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8568.56s)]
*  Easily done it after the fact. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8569.56s)]
*  But we have to go there to do it. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8570.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8573.56s)]
*  Oh, you're saying that moon landing was fake. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8574.56s)]
*  But we went back. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8576.56s)]
*  Oh, we went like the 80s or something. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8577.56s)]
*  But dude, that's tricky to pull off. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8578.56s)]
*  Like, oh, yeah. [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8580.56s)]
*  Well, you would just say it's your second whatever. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8581.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8584.56s)]
*  This is, I mean, according to science.howstuffworks, as cool as it would be to gaze up at the moon [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8586.56s)]
*  and see the lunar rovers, it's just not possible. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8592.56s)]
*  Unfortunately, there's no telescope on Earth powerful enough to spot any of the objects [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8594.56s)]
*  that have been left behind. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8597.56s)]
*  Not even Hubble could see what's left on the moon is designed to collect faint light of [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8598.56s)]
*  galaxies, not objects. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8601.56s)]
*  I thought there's a satellite there that can see it. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8602.56s)]
*  I think there's a laser on the moon that you can point at and bounce back at. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8605.56s)]
*  Yeah, you can point and get a mirror. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8608.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8609.56s)]
*  There's a mirror on the moon. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8610.56s)]
*  Okay. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8611.56s)]
*  So there's some shit that we put there. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8612.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8613.56s)]
*  So the moon was supposed to put there in 69. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8614.56s)]
*  I think so. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8615.56s)]
*  But some of the footage, I'm like, maybe that's too gazing. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8616.56s)]
*  I mean, I would have faked all that footage. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8619.56s)]
*  I'm like, could it get destroyed on your way back? [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8621.56s)]
*  Like the live streaming capabilities? [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8623.56s)]
*  I'm like, maybe they weren't live streaming. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8624.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8626.56s)]
*  Yeah, don't live stream it. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8627.56s)]
*  Fake all that shit. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8628.56s)]
*  Well, they did live stream it. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8629.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8630.56s)]
*  I'm saying fake all the, like, fake the live stream. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8631.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8633.56s)]
*  Do it. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8634.56s)]
*  I'm fine with all that. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8635.56s)]
*  That's great. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8636.56s)]
*  But I think the Soviets would have called us out. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8637.56s)]
*  They probably did. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8638.56s)]
*  But yeah. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8639.56s)]
*  No, but like, I'm assuming they would have been like, hey, they didn't go to the moon. [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8640.56s)]
*  This is all fake. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8643.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8644.56s)]
*  I bet that was the narrative there. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8645.56s)]
*  Did they say that? [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8646.56s)]
*  I'm sure. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8647.56s)]
*  I don't know if they said that. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8648.56s)]
*  I've never seen that. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8649.56s)]
*  I mean, I would have said it if I'm them. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8650.56s)]
*  You know? [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8653.56s)]
*  But yeah, I don't know. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8654.56s)]
*  I think probably. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8656.56s)]
*  Anyway, my boys, great to be back. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8657.56s)]

*  Yeah, we definitely need to talk about M-Pox and EEE. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8678.56s)]
*  Oh yeah, you know they changed the name of Monkey Box? [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8682.56s)]
*  To M-Pox. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a9756nMlHo&t=8684.56s)]
