*  He gotta be down. I mean, no, we're the best [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=44.34s)]
*  And then after the interview obviously we saw the reaction and you got 20 or 25 text messages and you were like this guy's winning [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=47.86s)]
*  Yo, listen wasn't the 20 25 text messages. You know what it was. It was the looks on the street [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=54.42s)]
*  Oh really the looks on the street. I was getting it was like, you know [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=60.74s)]
*  When like someone who's trying to sell you drugs like they give you this like nod [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=63.46s)]
*  Like a person you don't know like a person on the street. Yeah, right they go [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=67.62s)]
*  You would know [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=71.78s)]
*  I [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=73.86s)]
*  So they give you this nod like yo yo like I got what you need [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=83.62s)]
*  That's all i've been getting for the last week [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=87.38s)]
*  what a different racial reality we live in because i'm getting looks like [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=90.26s)]
*  Wow, that's so interesting. So you guys have had a different reaction 10 000 followers on instagram [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=95.3s)]
*  Anybody else? Well, our guy's just dumb as we're doing the patreon and he's like I just began so much hate in the past couple hours [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=98.74s)]
*  Yeah, and we're like why he's like well, I posted a picture of me endorsing donald trump. I didn't endorse him [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=104.58s)]
*  I sent the podcast episode live [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=109.38s)]
*  Posted [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=111.46s)]
*  You're surprised that there was a negative reaction to you posting a picture with the most divisive human being [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=128.1s)]
*  He didn't post like a clip where he was asking a question or nothing you just did the fanboy pic [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=136.18s)]
*  Yeah, let's say a piece of travis scott. It's not a picture with kamala. No question. Oh, don't do that, please [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=142.18s)]
*  Don't do the i have black friends thing that every podcast is doing before the interview [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=148.26s)]
*  friends [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=153.46s)]
*  No, no, no that is a thing that I noticed that like pods and we're intentional of not doing this and [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=162.1s)]
*  there have been positive like call her daddy trying to do with kamala and uh, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=166.9s)]
*  What's it called? And I think a bus into the boys did it when they had trump on shout out to the bus of the boys [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=170.82s)]
*  uh, and uh, but [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=175.86s)]
*  Essentially what you're trying to do is control the reaction [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=177.94s)]
*  So you're like almost like apologizing before you start and that was one thing that we said we're not doing on it because [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=180.74s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with interviewing the republican nominee for president who is already an ex-president posting a picture with him. That's [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=186.58s)]
*  Big mega [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=196.74s)]
*  I know you are [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=200.42000000000002s)]

*  You're sitting edger's haircut for the past year [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=208.18s)]
*  I did have a really good hair cut. I did have a really good hair cut. Your skin looks amazing. Thank you so much [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=210.66s)]

*  Wow [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=223.14000000000001s)]
*  Honestly alex might win this election [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=231.3s)]
*  I was not happy when trump called alex bald. That was one of the most [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=237.22s)]
*  Yo, do you know how hard I have to bite myself to not say something within 30 seconds al had whispered under his breath [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=242.58s)]
*  Yo, your ear don't look shot [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=248.02s)]
*  That was a ballsy thing I was I was shocked all trump had to say was you got great hair [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=252.5s)]
*  Why you hiding under that hat and al would be like his ear damn near blowing the fuck up [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=258.5s)]
*  When he gets shot with a bazooka that's crazy [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=264.90000000000003s)]
*  That is even here or something couch right now with that wound [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=267.46000000000004s)]
*  I was gonna make a hair comment, but then that would have ended the interview right now. Mark was nice with his hair comment [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=270.82000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, that was good. That was good. Yo, did you guys have any questions you want to ask him now? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=275.78000000000003s)]
*  I did have one [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=282.58000000000004s)]
*  Even did you put it out there dude this amount of people have asked me like yo, what did he smell like yo [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=288.18s)]
*  Why why is this a question? Okay? So what a single person asked me to actually [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=294.26000000000005s)]
*  I'll just ask that about you. Yeah [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=299.62s)]
*  One of the liberal talking points that's knocking trump right now is that he's apparently like shitting himself [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=302.1s)]
*  And uh, oh, yeah, and it's like okay. That's a crime [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=307.3s)]
*  Lock me up. You know what i'm saying? Like what's the what are we talking about? Punch him in his stomach, right? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=310.90000000000003s)]
*  Punch him in his stomach. We shit ourselves sometimes. You can't shit yourself sometimes. Yeah, I mean mark [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=315.62s)]
*  What are you raising your hand for shifting solidarity? You shit yourself? Oh, yeah, he shit himself too [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=322.26s)]
*  Yeah, if he eats three bites out of a hamburger, maybe yeah, he can't eat three. Who's allergic to red meat? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=327.06s)]
*  You're the king of the shitin' yourself [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=331.06s)]
*  You shit yourself all the time. I shit in toilets. No, no. Listen, why has this become a poop conversation? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=333.14000000000004s)]
*  Okay [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=337.94s)]
*  Political talk the election is how many days away three weeks or something like that. Yeah, okay [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=340.98s)]
*  We gotta have like we gotta be a serious podcast for the next three weeks [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=346.5s)]
*  Come on, okay [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=353.14s)]
*  So [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=355.46s)]
*  Well, yeah the poop thing that was one of the talking points that he's like shitting himself. He doesn't smell bad at all [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=356.58s)]
*  Also, he's not six three [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=360.98s)]
*  He's shrinking. Yeah, so definitely not six three. Okay. Yeah [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=363.62s)]
*  100 what I will say is my dad is also 81 and he used to be six one six feet and he's shorter [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=367.7s)]
*  I'll also say that he does not have dementia or whatever the fuck they're saying. He's sharp [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=374.82s)]
*  He's sharp and I have a father with dementia like I and I saw the signs 30 years ago with my dad [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=379.78s)]
*  Like I I know what maybe 20 years ago. Yeah [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=384.41999999999996s)]
*  So it's like I I am acutely aware of how they are and zero sign of that. Uh, not six three [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=387.7s)]
*  About that, yeah, but also 80 so it's like you start to maybe lose a few inches [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=394.02s)]
*  Yeah, you know, but anyway questions that you guys really want to ask. Well, I was gonna ask [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=398.65999999999997s)]
*  Hey, have you seen Shane Gillis's amazing impression of you? Well [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=402.82s)]
*  Did you see blessing with the boys do it? Yeah [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=406.65999999999997s)]
*  And he was like, I don't know who that is. He's and I don't like the impression [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=408.97999999999996s)]
*  He's seen that shit because they asked him they're like, do you know who Shane Gillis is? He goes no, he's a million percent [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=411.85999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, how do you not know? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=416.97999999999996s)]
*  And then they're like, oh he does this amazing impression with you and he kind of takes money goes [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=419.21999999999997s)]
*  I heard it's great [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=422.82s)]
*  I know it's great and then they moved the fuck on [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=424.97999999999996s)]
*  Yeah [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=427.94s)]
*  I was gonna ask him [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=428.97999999999996s)]
*  I was gonna ask him about the impression because I wanted there to be like a cool moment where he goes i've seen the impression [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=430.26s)]
*  It's the best impression. It's great blah blah blah. He does like a trump run on it [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=434.34s)]
*  And then that'd be like a funny moment and then I was asking his team [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=438.02s)]
*  I was like, does he like impressions and uh, this team is like not a big fan of impressions [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=440.73999999999995s)]
*  Not a big fan. So that's why [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=446.41999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, stay away [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=449.05999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, yeah me and him both so yeah, i'm always gonna ask uh, have you ever talked shit about someone that regretted it later [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=451.14s)]
*  Oh, that was one that we had talked about because on the call that he does with rfk after he gets shot [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=457.22s)]
*  He tells him he's like, yeah biden called me and he was so nice and friendly and I was just talking shit about him [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=463.38s)]
*  I felt so bad. Yeah, it was like such a candid honest moment [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=467.46s)]
*  I'm like, oh he must do that all the time, but didn't ask [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=470.02s)]
*  Yeah, just thought about my hair just thought about a hundred questions. I should ask and then just said they're terrifying. It was tricky like [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=472.66s)]
*  I was I told you guys this but like in retrospect what I wish that I did was I [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=478.09999999999997s)]
*  I knew things you want to ask at least one thing each and then I lobbed it to you guys [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=483.53999999999996s)]
*  But keep in mind in this situation [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=488.82s)]
*  They say you have an hour. You probably have around 45 minutes [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=491.46s)]
*  Yes, we ended up going for an hour and a half because he was having a really fun time and he basically [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=494.02s)]
*  His team was telling us we gotta wrap it up and I would look at them and then I would just look away [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=498.58s)]
*  Yeah, they weren't gonna walk into the interview [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=502.02s)]
*  I had told I told dove in the beginning of the thing I go dove. Yeah [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=504.74s)]

*  And he told us dove is dove is so smart. He could have sat on the side with the trump team [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=515.14s)]
*  Right [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=522.58s)]

*  One was about them telling us it's early. They were like they're gonna try to send it early [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=598.02s)]
*  Nobody fucking look in their direction. We are ignoring them. Donald trump tells us when it's over. He's a guy in charge [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=602.74s)]

*  And the other thing you said was 90% of the people are going to have their opinions formed before they listen to a second [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=615.2199999999999s)]
*  Of the episode you're not going to change their minds. Yeah, so don't worry about asking for everybody else [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=619.38s)]
*  Ask the questions you want to ask [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=622.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=624.02s)]
*  And I was really happy you said that that was really because the last thing you want to do is ask something [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=624.18s)]
*  That you don't believe in for somebody else and then have that also get rejected [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=628.0999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so now you're rejected for something you don't even believe in which is the worst thing [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=632.02s)]
*  It's almost like on stage if you're pandering. Yeah, and then the audience you still bomb [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=635.78s)]
*  Yeah, you're like I double bomb and I use my finite time to ask questions [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=640.98s)]
*  I think they might want me to ask a set of questions. I want to ask the shit [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=644.1s)]
*  Do you guys want to ask and it's so hard? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=646.74s)]
*  I wish you guys it's just he can he can go [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=648.2600000000001s)]
*  So you're trying so hard to get your question in and it's just you know [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=650.9000000000001s)]
*  So he we do the we do the pod pod comes out right and obviously we're all like, you know expecting [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=654.34s)]
*  Okay, what's gonna be the reaction to this? We knew it was a great pod, right? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=659.5400000000001s)]
*  It comes out. The reaction is like [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=663.3000000000001s)]
*  Reaction starts with the right the right fucking loves it. They're like finally this is don trump. This is the personality [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=665.54s)]
*  This is someone who's got charisma. He's making comedians laugh. He's just hanging out talking and uh, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=671.3s)]
*  They're like this. This is the best interview trump has ever every headline is the best interview trump has ever done whatever [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=677.3s)]
*  I expected that after it because I think we like kind of showed him as a as a man, right? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=682.9799999999999s)]
*  It wasn't like a gotcha type of interview. It's not really our style [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=686.9799999999999s)]
*  And like there was intention with that, you know [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=691.14s)]
*  Yeah, I think a lot of people that did do the gotcha interviews. I think it's very narcissistic. It's for you [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=693.14s)]
*  It's just for you. It's like not for the people exactly like or it's for your your fan base [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=697.78s)]
*  Just go look at you. You you know held the torch to him. But [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=701.46s)]
*  In my opinion, it's like you have an hour [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=704.98s)]
*  to potentially influence [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=707.46s)]
*  Someone who might be the most powerful person in the world [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=710.02s)]
*  To have empathy for something you really care about [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=712.9s)]
*  And he's listening to you [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=715.9399999999999s)]
*  So how can we create a situation where he actually listens and he doesn't feel bullied? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=717.7s)]
*  Yeah, and like there was a moment that you got him to say two things that he never said like a lot of like [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=721.7s)]
*  Interviewers they try to get him to say to admit shit [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=727.46s)]
*  And I know he doesn't present as a tough guy because you see him with this like coiffed hair and he's in a nice suit [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=731.62s)]
*  But I think his identity is that of like a tough guy like a macho guy. He's in new york guy who grew up on construction sites [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=736.9s)]
*  he's like be tough and [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=743.46s)]
*  When you try to bully someone tough the reaction is ah, fuck you [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=746.98s)]
*  I'm not gonna do it, but he was so comfortable that he said yeah, we're gonna have elections [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=749.54s)]
*  It was the election of course, we're gonna have elections and this is what I actually meant by he never explains his positions [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=754.02s)]
*  But he fucking explained it and I thought that was a testament to like us creating a really good environment [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=758.98s)]
*  And you even setting up the question in a way. Thank you. And um, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=763.38s)]
*  Yeah, I was just like I was really proud that we got to a point where we could even have that back and forth about america [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=767.4599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you know that was awesome immigration even like yeah, that was awesome [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=772.26s)]

*  And um, you even got him to compliment gavin newsome's hair [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=784.66s)]
*  That is crazy not on my list [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=788.42s)]

*  You know, like uh, what was that term? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1024.6599999999999s)]
*  Were you like trying to play the algorithm? Yeah. Yeah and uh, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1026.8999999999999s)]
*  But it helped me understand like I do think people authentically see things based on what they believe so I have a little bit more [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1031.06s)]
*  I have a little less resentment for the public. Okay for content creators [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1036.98s)]
*  Yeah, at least the first wave the ones that just grift because they see the views fuck them. Yeah, but the initial reaction [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1041.3s)]
*  I go, okay that was real. You're not just trying to fluff your base. It's a rorschach [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1046.34s)]
*  You really see what you want to see [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1050.2s)]
*  And I think that applies to a lot of things like I feel like there's stuff I can even think of like [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1052.3600000000001s)]
*  You know some social thing or like some guy says something about like, you know class and then it's misinterpreted by [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1055.88s)]
*  A whole different contingent about race. Yes. It's like well, I didn't mean it that way [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1061.64s)]
*  But now I can see it if you're saying that like that's what those people really see [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1065.24s)]
*  Yeah, someone being just like I love I love the cops [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1069.0800000000002s)]
*  And then black people interpret that like oh you're racist. You love that those cops are racist [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1071.8000000000002s)]
*  You love that those cops beat us up. No, no, I love that [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1075.8s)]
*  They like keep on if you understand the black people's relationship with cops [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1078.28s)]
*  All of a sudden it can make complete sense and those are the glasses everyone wears all the time and the person that says I love the cops [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1080.9199999999998s)]
*  Hasn't experienced maybe the treatment that some of those black friends have gone through [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1086.12s)]
*  And if he did experience that he might go [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1090.52s)]
*  The cops have always really protected me and I have a great relationship with them and for that [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1093.56s)]
*  I'm really grateful and I've seen some fucked up situations with cops as well [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1096.52s)]
*  Yeah, but if you're only in your little echo chamber [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1099.96s)]
*  You don't have the I guess experience to talk about that. Yeah [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1103.1599999999999s)]
*  back to your point where is the level of [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1106.9199999999998s)]
*  grift and [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1110.6s)]
*  I truly feel that way. Where does it start or where does it end? That's that's the thing. I can't identify [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1112.12s)]
*  Yeah, I feel a little more cynical than you guys do. I know that happens what you're saying [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1116.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, but I think a lot of people are feeding their bases what they think they want to hear [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1120.28s)]
*  And that's the people writing the headlines [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1125.24s)]
*  I don't know how many I think I tend to think the majority of them are [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1127.88s)]
*  How do I get my how do I appease the people that subscribe and keep them subscribed? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1131.32s)]
*  I think it's if you make content you're making it [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1135.08s)]
*  A little bit grifty and it's like you're just telling people how to feel so [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1138.6000000000001s)]
*  I agree with you. I think that and we've had this discussion before where like the algorithm never in history [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1143.4s)]
*  were you able to know exactly what your base wanted as as [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1148.44s)]
*  As well as you know now [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1153.72s)]
*  Right because the algorithm can decide for you. Yeah, so oftentimes like the algorithm dictates the content you make [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1156.04s)]
*  We've talked about this before right and you see certain like grifty fucks on the internet that basically oh, okay [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1163.0s)]
*  My base like likes this. I'm just going to feed them that yeah [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1168.68s)]
*  And I think that like we've been very intentional about creating the shit that we like [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1170.92s)]
*  Yeah, and hopefully we get an audience that reflects the things that we like [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1174.84s)]
*  That means we might get half a million views on an episode with dax. That is like awesome [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1178.28s)]
*  I loved and we might get four million on episode with don trump, but that's just what it is [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1182.92s)]
*  Yeah, but I think there are people that have less [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1186.92s)]
*  Integrity or they just want to just make the videos that make the most money and they're just going to run after it [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1190.02s)]
*  We are also a little bit privileged to be in a position where all of us have another income stream [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1193.8s)]
*  Yes [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1197.48s)]
*  So we can kind of afford to do this whereas some people you have a page your audience wants this one thing [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1197.8799999999999s)]
*  I can only feed them this because I don't have another income stream to fall back on [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1203.96s)]
*  So we are in a little bit privileged for this but even i'm not even lying part of me was intentional in posting [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1208.44s)]
*  I didn't think I would get that much blowback [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1213.4s)]
*  But the picture with trump I was like, yeah a couple thousand might unfollow [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1214.92s)]
*  I want those people gone and if we were lucky enough to have a democratic nominee [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1218.2s)]
*  I would post a picture with them. I want the right-wing idiots to unfollow too. Y'all could go [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1222.0400000000002s)]
*  Y'all can all go. I would like to curate an audience. That's like let's hear what someone has to say. I just want maga [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1226.2800000000002s)]
*  I'm maga all the way [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1232.5200000000002s)]
*  I'm a prisoner of the moment and right now I will be a prisoner of that for the next 25 days [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1234.04s)]
*  When is the election? [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1238.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't want to ask him a question about policy was more or so about like how does he truly feel because like [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1239.56s)]
*  In the 90s early 2000s. He was loved like before he got into politics everybody [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1245.08s)]
*  Both sides loved him. And so I just wanted to ask i'm like now that you got into politics and you have, you know [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1250.3600000000001s)]
*  large groups of people [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1256.6000000000001s)]
*  Deeming him as either racist or next hitler and all that. How does that make you feel? Yeah, that's what I wanted [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1258.04s)]
*  Yeah, I really wish you I wish we had three hours [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1262.92s)]
*  Yeah [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1264.92s)]
*  Because like I would love to know that reaction and i'd love to know that reaction an hour and a half into the pod [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1265.32s)]
*  Yeah when he was comfortable there was even a moment in the pod like nobody picked up on it, but [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1270.76s)]
*  where uh [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1275.24s)]
*  I think I asked him. I was like, how does it feel when these people say things about you that you don't believe are true [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1276.44s)]
*  And he goes, yeah, I don't like it or it hurts. Yeah, it bothers me. It bothers. Yeah. He goes it bothers me [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1280.76s)]
*  Like you're bothered by anything. Have you ever heard trump admit that anything bothered him? Yeah [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1285.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but it makes me wonder though like again he's lived a fascinating life like objectively we're trying to talk about this like who's [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1290.12s)]
*  Lived a more interesting life than him, but he's like best friends with oprah all through like the 80s and 90s [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1295.48s)]
*  They're gonna run together [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1300.2s)]
*  She jokes around like we should run for president ham and howard stern are boys and they're hanging out doing, you know [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1301.3999999999999s)]
*  Radio together. Yeah, and then all of these people turn their backs on like this guy's gonna destroy the country [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1306.44s)]
*  He's a racist piece of shit. Da da da. I wonder if that yeah like to that idea [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1310.76s)]
*  Like I wonder if it bothers him. I think it does like to that. Uh, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1314.6s)]
*  I think what politics does is for most people [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1318.52s)]
*  It brings out what you believe to be the best version of yourself [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1322.68s)]
*  in other words [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1327.96s)]
*  What is the most altruistic version of me? [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1330.44s)]
*  And I want that represented in politics now some people think that that is to be staunchly republican [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1333.8s)]
*  Some people believe it's staunchly democratic, right? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1338.68s)]
*  But it's not indicative of who you know, you actually are [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1342.04s)]
*  Because you want your politician to be the best version of you [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1345.56s)]
*  But you lose all nuance in that [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1349.8s)]
*  You know, and I think that's why you get a guy like stern who's you know [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1352.52s)]
*  Told crazy jokes and you know has had everybody on his pod and like he's got you know strippers, you know [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1356.04s)]
*  Sitting on speakers and you know coming during the radio and now he's like I think that this guy is a piece of shit [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1361.48s)]
*  He's a dirtbag and how could anybody support him? And it's like, okay, well because when it comes to politics, that's not fun [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1367.6399999999999s)]
*  You know the stakes are too high [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1374.9199999999998s)]
*  So I have empathy for his position too. Yeah. Yeah, like I I don't [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1376.9199999999998s)]
*  I don't write people off immediately like I did and now that I know that it's not all how can I grift off of this moment? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1381.0s)]
*  that people are actually [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1387.8799999999999s)]
*  impacted [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1390.34s)]
*  Especially when it comes to politics. I go. Okay, maybe you're not being an asshole [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1391.8s)]
*  This is what you think the best version of the world is and you're going to support that [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1395.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I mean [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1402.12s)]
*  So yeah, so it was awesome interview and everybody loved it and then a day later dove was like, oh by the way [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1404.84s)]

*  And three and a half hours afterwards we get this email [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1500.44s)]
*  Yeah, first off. I want to thank you for thinking of bam for andrew schultz's upcoming comedy show [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1503.56s)]
*  We are always excited when promoters consider our space for their events after some internal discussions with leadership [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1508.12s)]
*  It was decided that bam is not the right fit for this show at this time [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1513.8s)]
*  That said we really do appreciate you reaching out. We'd love to work with you in the future and [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1518.52s)]
*  For future events that might be a better match for bam [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1523.72s)]
*  Hmm [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1527.88s)]
*  So if anybody has a venue [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1529.56s)]
*  If you've got a venue for us, that'd be really great. I'd really love to shoot this special [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1531.8s)]
*  And uh, that'd be really awesome. The irony is this is your most personal special. Yes. Yes. Yes [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1535.24s)]
*  Like it's not as political as it's you and your journey. Yeah, but but also what's interesting about it is that [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1540.12s)]
*  Again, they cancelled it three hours after the interview came out. So before the liberal media [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1545.72s)]
*  Spun it [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1551.96s)]
*  In liberals favor. So if they waited two days [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1553.32s)]
*  They get the hero. You're a darling the liberals. You just gotta send him be like I laughed in his face [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1557.08s)]
*  Like you guys don't understand now. Fuck them [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1561.48s)]
*  Fuck them and fuck them forever. Yeah, that's crazy. You gotta come to queens man, brooklyn [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1564.28s)]
*  It's no good. Yeah, yeah, staton island. I think there's a nice theater at stan [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1568.92s)]
*  Brooklyn, I didn't know that you guys were assault. There is one st george theater. We're looking at there you go [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1572.6s)]
*  That's what you need. You need something union something fireman goes. Yeah [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1576.2s)]
*  Ladder 50 staton island where y'all where y'all [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1581.08s)]
*  I just add something to that just because I know I had to I pitched what the hour was about [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1583.32s)]
*  Yeah in order to like just discuss them get them all on the same team [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1588.6s)]
*  There were fans of like so touched by what it's about [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1591.8799999999999s)]
*  You know people that know know and so i'm like it's not like they don't think that this [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1596.12s)]
*  Particular hours can work for them. This felt felt personal [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1601.96s)]
*  Yeah, but they never specified though. Again. I can't say for sure that this is what it is [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1606.12s)]
*  but [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1611.6399999999999s)]
*  Before it came out. It was fine [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1612.76s)]
*  Maybe after it came out they familiarized themselves with me and then saw other things that they didn't like that's also possible [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1614.9199999999998s)]
*  But haircut, yeah, it might have been I was thinking that I was thinking that [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1621.08s)]
*  I did I do that [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1625.8s)]
*  Yeah, so now what [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1631.48s)]
*  Well, listen records what november we were supposed to record it in a month [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1633.72s)]
*  This is uh, yeah [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1638.2s)]
*  There's been a wrench thrown in things [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1639.96s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1642.04s)]
*  But yeah, you have any places in mind that you want to say out loud or you I mean [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1643.96s)]
*  We've been looking non-stop and the tricky thing [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1647.3999999999999s)]
*  I guess why this is maybe this is too much inside baseball, but like most venues are booked like months in advance [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1649.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so now you're dealing with like limited avails, but like so we might have to do it, you know during a week day [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1655.4s)]
*  You know, it might be a little bit more inconvenient. Hopefully everybody still comes out. That'd be really awesome [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1661.72s)]
*  If I take it very quickly because usually these are on sale for months and months and we're gonna have a short window [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1666.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, and also because andrew likes to change the seating plan in every venue. He does [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1670.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we also have the approvals by the city that just make everything harder [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1675.0s)]
*  So if you happen to own a beautiful theater in new york city or tri-state area [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1679.4s)]
*  And you would like to open your doors to us [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1683.6399999999999s)]
*  No, no, no, that's not we don't endorse that we don't endorse that [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1687.96s)]
*  I I i'm a you know, what is it? I my vote was up for grabs [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1692.52s)]
*  You're yeah, the board of bam has really pushed me in a direction. We have to stop this sensor [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1696.12s)]
*  We do have an invitation at 1600 pennsylvania avenue to do a special. Can we shoot it there? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1701.6399999999999s)]
*  Hasn't there been enough shootings? [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1706.6799999999998s)]
*  Long island I think is your move that's the move [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1711.0s)]
*  Long island. Yes, they're gonna have plenty of love for you [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1713.56s)]
*  Now what if we just get comelon and then they'll have you back we would love to have comelon [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1717.8s)]
*  There you go. You have her we reached out to her team and uh, they're not really enthusiastic. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1721.8s)]
*  They didn't listen to the show. Yeah, I don't know why what unless he was a patron [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1726.6s)]
*  Point is the president is going to be chosen a few weeks and the line is changing. Yeah [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1733.08s)]
*  Looks like it's uh, it's favorite trompito for victory right now, but you can obviously put your bread up [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1737.1599999999999s)]
*  You know steak is a place that you can you can gamble on sports obviously [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1742.52s)]
*  But I think we got something more important than sports right now. Yeah, we do [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1746.6000000000001s)]
*  We have the faith of free world. Yep, and you can bet on it. Why not? [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1750.44s)]
*  How wild is that? It's crazy bet on the fate of the free really crazy. Yeah it is [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1753.72s)]
*  That's really the only way you can make money no matter who gets elected. Yeah, that is true. That is that is true [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1758.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I guess there's some people who think they're gonna make a lot more money if kamala wins or if trump wins [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1764.3600000000001s)]
*  But you you're all wrong the individual this is how you make money. This is how you profit [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1769.16s)]
*  This is how the real working class can make money off an election. Usually [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1773.96s)]
*  You're completely forgotten. You're a tool a cog in the machine, but not [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1779.4s)]
*  When it comes to gambling on the president power, it sounds even crazy to say it [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1783.72s)]
*  But steak is the leader in global betting and u.s social casinos bet on top sports and political events [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1788.2s)]
*  Like our fucking presidency and use the promo code flagrant for your welcome bonus now [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1794.6s)]
*  It's time to get back to the show. We have more to discuss [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1801.16s)]
*  The fate of the free world. What do you guys think is gonna happen? Have you felt any uh change in energy like [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1803.8s)]
*  Yeah, you felt I felt a big change in energy toward trump and it's not even just our interview [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1809.8s)]
*  I just feel like the enthusiasm that kamala had and this goes back and forth [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1815.0s)]
*  But right now the enthusiasm kamala had seems like it's done and we're gonna take all the credit for it [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1819.08s)]
*  But yeah, it does happen around election time [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1823.0s)]
*  But have you also noticed that kind of and what do you what do you think that that is indicative of like what happened? [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1825.56s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's partially trump doing like a big media blitz where he's just being himself [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1831.8s)]
*  Yeah, and then kamala not doing an amazing media run [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1835.72s)]
*  Like I think it's to be honest more her sort of missteps like the 60 minutes thing [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1838.44s)]
*  I don't think worked out well the caller daddy thing. I don't think worked out well [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1842.92s)]
*  And I don't think it's alex's fault necessarily. I don't think it's anything she did [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1846.52s)]
*  I just think the nature of the show and how kamala handled the questions. Yeah, I just don't think it played well in her favor [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1850.2s)]
*  Yeah, I I thought she was good on caller day. I thought she was more thoughtful than I actually thought she was pretty good [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1855.8s)]
*  I think we're just used to trump. It's been such a long time of us seeing him say the wildest act crazy and now it's just like [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1861.4s)]
*  All right, we're [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1869.56s)]
*  Desensitized to the madness of what this used to be. I mean, yeah, I also think weirdly she's better [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1871.0800000000002s)]
*  Off the cuff than when it feels bro the Oprah thing if someone comes in my house, they're getting shot the fuck up [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1878.1200000000001s)]
*  We all said it she the beat she killed him [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1888.28s)]
*  Unlike she's better off the cuff and when it feels like I don't know if their team or what but when she [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1890.92s)]
*  Tries to be very curated specific planned out in event. It doesn't seem to go as well [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1895.24s)]
*  Let her go. I'm very curious to see her go on fox. I think she goes on tomorrow. I believe yeah [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1899.64s)]
*  That's that's gonna be interesting because really good move, you know [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1905.24s)]
*  She's gonna be attacked and how she handles that is gonna be very telling. I think [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1907.8000000000002s)]
*  I was talking to shawty man about this. I think that [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1911.88s)]
*  She's better when she's being attacked. I was just gonna say that i'm thinking about her job. Yeah, it's a prosecutor [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1915.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, go on that go on that if your job is arguing with people [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1921.24s)]
*  If somebody's attacking you part of your job, you don't get to be da by being bad at arguing [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1925.0800000000002s)]
*  And being bad in the courtroom indian woman. Yeah, she's indian [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1929.72s)]
*  She's [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1932.28s)]
*  So funny it's happening in real time you watch it like oh you fell for it [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1948.28s)]
*  I know these tricks. I know these tricks [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1954.28s)]
*  But yeah, I think she can argue. I think that's part of her position [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1957.32s)]
*  So when you attack she just goes into instincts, which is this is my job is what i've done for decades now [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1960.12s)]
*  here's your counter argument, let's go there's a [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1965.7199999999998s)]
*  there there's a there's a [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1968.76s)]
*  A moment well not even a moment, but like i've watched some of the interviews that she did [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1971.1599999999999s)]
*  I mean she did uh, what is the guy's name colbert then she did [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1975.7199999999998s)]
*  uh, there was the 60 minutes and then she did call her daddy and [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1979.4799999999998s)]
*  I think the unfortunate thing about a lot of these spaces and then she even I think did the view a little bit [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1983.7199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and then yeah, I didn't see much of the stern, but I think the unfortunate thing for her is what? [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1988.6s)]
*  Just the idea of her on stern back in the day. Yeah, sit on that speaker [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=1994.76s)]
*  Let me show you my whoopee goldberg impression [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2005.8s)]
*  Yo, that that's getting crazy. Well when stern that black face on yeah [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2008.76s)]
*  Dropped a couple of miles [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2016.04s)]
*  Wait, was he saying it? Oh, he was dropping hard on oh, wow. Wow. What committed to the bit. Yeah, he did [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2017.96s)]
*  Hey, I thought he was talking about his hair [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2023.24s)]
*  I think I think what what basically happens is [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2025.8000000000002s)]
*  I think when you're set up in an interview that's basically been curated so you win [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2028.92s)]
*  All you're thinking about is losing. Oh interesting, right? [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2034.2s)]
*  It's like the questions are predetermined and you know that colbert's looking at you and he wants you to be great [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2037.5600000000002s)]
*  And he wants his audience to love you and they're fluffing you and she's not used to this, right? She's a [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2041.88s)]
*  Woman of color that comes up in the fucking justice system. Like she's a she's a lawyer [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2047.72s)]
*  She's a pro. She's used to like arguing [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2053.64s)]
*  And fighting with people being underestimated fighting odds like having to go up the uphill [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2056.28s)]
*  Like this is probably all new to her and all [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2061.4s)]
*  Uncomfortable and maybe you don't even trust it [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2064.42s)]
*  Maybe you're just like nah some about this don't feel right because this is not what i've experienced again for decades [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2066.84s)]
*  We're not making excuses. Like you gotta do better [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2071.72s)]
*  Yeah, like you gotta win like you should be able to take these, you know [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2073.7999999999997s)]
*  Puff piece interviews and then you should be able to dunk them home. That is the idea. She [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2077.24s)]
*  Doesn't do well in them [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2082.04s)]
*  And she does do well when there's some conflict, which is why I think the fox thing is good [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2083.56s)]
*  But I was telling charlomane because charlomane's interviewing her. We're recording this tuesday. He's interviewing today and i'm like yo [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2087.72s)]
*  You might have to fight with her a little bit. Yeah, like I think that energy is actually better for her [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2092.3599999999997s)]
*  and verbally [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2098.12s)]
*  Verbally, I mean if she dodges a punch or two and then [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2100.3599999999997s)]
*  That might be her presidency [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2104.04s)]
*  but I think the issue is [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2105.72s)]
*  Yeah, she doesn't do well when she's being supported. She hasn't been supported ever publicly like think about it [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2108.3599999999997s)]
*  As long as she's been on the national stage. Oh, yeah, that's true. Everybody has shit on her when she's running for president [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2114.04s)]
*  Shit on her right? Like the last I mean during the biden presidency [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2119.64s)]
*  Shit on yeah, I don't think she knows how to be loved publicly and then all of a sudden three months ago [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2123.56s)]
*  We're all like, oh, she's awesome. Yeah, and she's probably like what? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2129.0s)]
*  None of y'all like me before fuck all of you because in the interviews she does have this energy of let me not fuck this up [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2133.32s)]
*  What was that answer again? It seems like she's searching [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2139.7200000000003s)]
*  For the idea that she's supposed to say and then she fucks up questions that like she should have a dialed in answer for yeah [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2143.0800000000004s)]
*  Like pretty easy questions. It's hard to have a dialed in answer when you just got put in this position [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2149.48s)]
*  Three months ago [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2156.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I mean no excuse like you either want to be president or not. Don't run then don't run. Yeah [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2157.96s)]
*  Seize the moment. She kind of didn't [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2163.96s)]
*  Nah, she wanted she's in politics for a reason they all want to be honest [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2167.32s)]
*  If you were running for president, you would want everyone to hate you. She also sorry. Let me clear up. Let's [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2170.36s)]
*  No, let's clear up one more thing. She ran six years ago [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2175.4s)]
*  Did you not have a plan six years ago when you actually ran announced lost to biden? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2178.36s)]
*  Did you not have any there's nothing from that you can reach for me like oh, yeah, I remember that that's that's what I [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2182.68s)]
*  Wanted for america six years ago has it transformed so radically not even six four years ago. It has a trans [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2187.32s)]
*  No, it was pandemic when she ran [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2193.56s)]
*  You give it a lot of the stuff she ran on they are like crucifying [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2195.8s)]
*  Crucifying her for it now like fracking and all that then you gotta talk about it [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2200.12s)]
*  I mean she kind of just switched her position on it [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2204.44s)]
*  And she got a shit on biden and she's scared to shit on biden, which is so crazy [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2206.6s)]
*  Is there anything you would have done different? Nope. Nope, that's it. What's that's a losing answer [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2210.04s)]
*  Explain if you are going to say no explain why don't just say no and sit there. Yeah, so she's fumbling these interviews [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2215.56s)]
*  This is my hard man. This is my this is my take on it [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2222.04s)]
*  This is my take on it somebody get you to that position and you got shit on them [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2225.1600000000003s)]
*  There's a way to do it and again [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2230.6s)]
*  If you're running for president, you should know the way to do it [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2234.28s)]
*  You guys are sitting there hopefully for hours a day saying how do we answer this question because it is the number one question [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2237.2400000000002s)]
*  Everybody's mind that guy's dead. That's a dead guy. That's what I would say [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2243.32s)]
*  I think in practice she probably has the answer queued up and then I think she just too like you guys pointed out [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2246.6800000000003s)]
*  It's like she's too afraid to fail. Really? [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2251.6400000000003s)]
*  I what are you like? This is it? No, i'm just getting with you everybody hits the shots in practice. Yeah [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2254.52s)]
*  But the superstars are decided by who hits it in the game. I know i'm just giving her a little creep [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2262.04s)]
*  I know what you do [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2267.2400000000002s)]
*  In practice this guy's so good, he's one of the best guys [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2272.0400000000004s)]

*  Well, yeah, that's what we're all asking [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2337.24s)]
*  When you see him in the fatigues, but when he puts on the suit [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2343.64s)]
*  All right, let's go, okay [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2349.24s)]
*  so [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2351.3999999999996s)]
*  So real quick so real quick I do think that uh [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2353.8799999999997s)]
*  Assessing the energy the shift that we've seen I think a little bit [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2357.16s)]
*  There's another observation i've had um [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2361.0s)]
*  and I think it's [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2363.4799999999996s)]
*  There's a lot of trump supporters [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2365.3199999999997s)]
*  In liberal cities that are terrified of like being outed as a trump supporter, right? [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2368.3599999999997s)]
*  Like in new york, there's a lot of people who support trump that will never let you know [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2374.4399999999996s)]
*  they're really quiet about it it's like on some fight club shit like [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2377.72s)]
*  I don't know about fight club [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2381.56s)]
*  And then if you go, yeah, i'm going to fight club you like all right fight club's kind of fire [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2383.08s)]
*  I go there a lot and what happened is when biden was running he was so [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2386.04s)]
*  decrepit [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2391.3799999999997s)]
*  That they got to pretend that they were supporting trump because it was the best thing for the country [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2392.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't like the guy but you know, if it's biden's so old I can't possibly vote for him [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2398.3599999999997s)]
*  So they like masqueraded as like that's the lesser of two evils. Yeah when deep down [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2402.8399999999997s)]
*  They always like trump but they were just worried what their co-workers would say etc. Right? Not me at all [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2408.04s)]
*  So so what happened is [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2415.96s)]
*  When kamala comes in there's this huge media push and there's all this positive energy and they get terrified [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2418.12s)]
*  They go back in the closet. They're like fuck. Oh, yeah, I guess she's really good [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2423.64s)]
*  Then we'll see what happens in the election, but they never stop supporting trump [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2426.8399999999997s)]
*  she does a few interviews that are [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2430.52s)]
*  Not the greatest and then trump does a few interviews that are really fun [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2433.32s)]
*  And I think all of a sudden they got a little bit more bold [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2439.0s)]
*  Then they started giving kamala the biden treatment like she she can't even answer a question [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2442.12s)]
*  She doesn't even know what she's doing out there. Like I think unfortunately we'll have to go for trump [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2446.84s)]
*  But they were never not voting for trump. Yeah, you know what I mean? Not me [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=2451.96s)]

*  Thank god. I feel so guilty. This is russian election interference. Oh a million percent. It's also [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3120.2000000000003s)]
*  Mark take us to camp. I'm saying why because it's basically stoking racial [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3125.6400000000003s)]
*  Feelings in america. There's already animosity between americans with you know, just like christian americans that support israel [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3130.52s)]
*  And then obviously jews in america that support israel and then you have palestinian americans arab americans black americans that don't like israel [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3137.16s)]
*  And therefore that turns an anti-segment [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3143.48s)]
*  People versus non-white people. Yeah, the whites versus the losers. All right, and it's become a whole fucking thing [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3145.64s)]
*  Right. It's a big proxy world, huh? Exactly. So russia benefits from there being dissent in the united states [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3151.16s)]
*  So what do they do? They publish an article on columbus day. Hey christopher columbus actually isn't white [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3156.68s)]
*  He's a jew exonerating white people to know i don't want to feel bad about native americans because it was really christopher columbus [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3160.44s)]
*  The jews that did it. Yeah, the jews did native american jennison before I had to feel bad about what native what? [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3166.12s)]
*  Christopher columbus did to the native americans. Yeah, and it fucking killed me. Yeah, you were losing sleep [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3171.64s)]
*  I would lose sleep. You had a drink catcher over your fucking bed [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3176.92s)]
*  Just to catch all the sleep you were losing. Is that too far to after what you did to these people? [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3180.8399999999997s)]
*  You know what? We're so sorry. I'm actually mad that we used to celebrate them and now it's indigenous day [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3185.72s)]
*  I was like, oh wow, I haven't made that transition. Do you call it indigenous? I'd never cared about the day [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3190.92s)]
*  As soon as I graduated and stopped being a holiday. I didn't give a fuck about the day. It never mattered to me [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3195.88s)]

*  That's crazy here in the states. Nobody wants to claim chris over columbus, but in europe everybody's fighting [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3245.32s)]
*  He was italian [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3250.92s)]
*  Between the italians and the spaniards you're just like kind of makes sense because Sephardic jews are from i'm literally from [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3257.6400000000003s)]

*  Can you cut this cut this from the whole episode and then can you take this part and then just light it on fire and [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3271.4s)]
*  Send me a video [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3277.0800000000004s)]
*  Thank you very much, okay, but christopher columbus apparently was sailing west to find riches [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3279.7999999999997s)]
*  Did you check out not no, no, I thought that's very jewish of him [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3288.12s)]
*  I thought he was going to kill native americans, but turns out he was looking for gold. I got you good [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3292.2799999999997s)]
*  This is pretty jew you know what if I don't want to add to this conspiracy, but 1491 [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3297.3199999999997s)]
*  Is the spanish inquisition right they kick all the jews? [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3302.68s)]
*  That will convert out of spain some say that you know [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3304.92s)]
*  They took all their money and that's why they were able to go on these you know extravagant trips around the world to explore [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3308.2000000000003s)]
*  But another way of framing it is hey [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3313.7200000000003s)]
*  If you're going to be a jew and you're going to stay here [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3316.84s)]
*  You're going to go find another way to get to india so we can get these spices [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3319.0s)]
*  You better go so maybe he was like a prisoner [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3322.6800000000003s)]
*  Of the monarchy and he was punished with this trip to india. I just looked it up isabel and ferdinand also jews [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3327.16s)]
*  So they're all jews nouns. Yep isabel and ferdinand you're talking about the king and queen of of spain [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3334.76s)]
*  The son of mover though everyone's jews are they really that was corny the candice owens is twitter that I was just [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3340.6800000000003s)]
*  I was just [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3348.28s)]
*  Making it easier though like like it is like there's so many variables in life [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3349.2400000000002s)]
*  And if you could just distill them down to one right like it just makes anything inconvenient to you [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3353.88s)]
*  You know the glasses you were talking about before the world view it just the jews did it and you put it on [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3359.2400000000002s)]
*  Jesus i will die for your sins guys just keep on throwing at us another jew big jew fucking never ends with you guys [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3363.48s)]
*  It really doesn't [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3370.52s)]
*  It really really doesn't okay anything else anything else we guys learned you guys learned anything else you want to reflect on [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3372.12s)]
*  Who do you think wins the election? [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3378.12s)]
*  I think trump [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3380.6s)]
*  He might have it. He's wow like I know polls are shit [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3382.12s)]
*  But he's doing better in polls now than he did in 2016 and 2020 and he tends to overperform [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3384.76s)]
*  Relative to polling on election. Yeah, that's a good point [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3390.12s)]
*  That's a good point now some states apparently like wisconsin had the last time they had trump winning by like 16 17 points [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3393.08s)]
*  And then i'm pretty sure he lost it or barely won it in 2020 [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3397.72s)]
*  But so I guess polling is off on both sides, but it does the energy right now feels like it's toward trump [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3400.92s)]
*  I'm not even common needs to do more fun podcasts like this. She tried to do caller duty. What is it called? [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3406.12s)]

*  Caller duty, but she can't have what's the name of the podcast? [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3417.3199999999997s)]

*  Yeah, and that is a lesson that every president is sucking dick though. Yo, jug emhoff her husband [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=3435.32s)]

*  Of eerily calm. I was throwing up in the bathroom two nights before you were so calm. I was like, this is nuts, dude [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4018.68s)]

*  No, no in all seriousness, uh [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4039.72s)]
*  I thought I was really well prepared usually nerves for me are about lack of preparation [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4042.52s)]
*  So if i'm nervous for a pod, I know I didn't prepare. I know I didn't like watch enough podcasts with them [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4046.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't know their flow. I don't have like good questions and I can't back up the things I want to ask. Yeah, and um [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4051.0s)]
*  But but for this I you know, I put some time in I was like [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4057.16s)]
*  I kind of want to understand what he's gonna do like I knew that he can steam roll [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4059.88s)]
*  I know he's I I thought that we could control the conversation a little bit better, but he's a force [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4064.12s)]
*  He'll just talk whenever he wants to steamroll. Yeah, but I felt no I felt I felt kind of really comfortable [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4069.4s)]
*  and it was [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4074.6s)]
*  the feeling I had afterwards was [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4075.7200000000003s)]
*  Um [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4078.92s)]
*  Who is a bigger guest than that? [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4081.32s)]
*  Yeah, like is there somebody bigger than that obama? [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4083.56s)]
*  I don't think he is now. Fuck. I I would love to sit down with obama. Don't get me wrong [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4087.16s)]
*  Fuck god, but like I don't think he's bigger. I don't fuck it crazy lenses. This is lenses [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4091.64s)]
*  I think I think if you go back during obama's heyday, of course, he's the most famous person on the planet [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4098.76s)]
*  but I think now I [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4103.08s)]
*  I don't think obama's bigger than trump. I think he still [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4106.2s)]
*  Controls the party. I agree with you. But in terms of like [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4109.54s)]
*  World view right now. I think because trump is running for president [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4113.72s)]
*  Headlines this podcast generated versus I mean I would love to have a bum I would fucking love it [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4117.88s)]
*  But yeah number of headlines. I think trump is just gonna garner more headlines [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4123.8s)]
*  He just is an attention grabbing human being sir. He said that oh they said you can't do numbers [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4126.84s)]
*  That's what that's what they're saying. They said let's get oh and see who was wrong. I would love to be proven wrong [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4132.76s)]
*  Come on. I would love to be proven wrong. I think we'd have the best interview with him [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4137.400000000001s)]
*  I think I walked out feeling like we had the best interview you can have with trump [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4140.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think it was his best interview and I thought we asked for the most part what we wanted to ask I think all of us [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4144.84s)]
*  Probably had a couple one or two things we would wish we could have gotten in [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4151.0s)]
*  But again, you're a finite time he can steamroll you want to make sure he knows [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4153.64s)]
*  This is a friendly space or like a friendly enough space [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4158.280000000001s)]
*  We're not just trying to do gotcha moments dunk on you all things considered. I just walked up being like that was great [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4160.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I felt I felt really good about it. I felt really good about it [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4165.8s)]
*  It is a tough thing to pivot out of conversation about politics now because I feel like it's the only thing that [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4169.08s)]
*  America cares about probably for the next month and then we'll move on pretty quickly unless there's another like event [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4174.12s)]
*  Hopefully there's not but if there's a peaceful transfer of power then americans get back to caring about sports or whatever else is [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4179.8s)]

*  Exactly what to do. You're kind of figuring out everything. She has read every single book [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4600.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah, she has watched every single video. They know every single thing that's going on with this kid [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4604.919999999999s)]
*  I think it kind of helps to freestyle though [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4609.4s)]
*  If you go in too prepared then you only know like four different ways like he was crying the other night [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4610.5199999999995s)]
*  And I was like what if you do this with him and I just like kind of put him [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4614.12s)]
*  Kind of down shook him a little. Yep. Hey, stop crying. Yo, can I say this about real quick? [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4617.0s)]
*  They say that and I and this is a very important thing to say [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4621.24s)]
*  They shaking baby syndrome is a thing where like the babies could die when they get shaken too much [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4624.36s)]
*  But here's the thing we never talk. No, no, that's the point [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4628.92s)]
*  I'm trying to make we don't talk about how much fun it is when you shit they love being shaken [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4632.599999999999s)]
*  so I almost have a little empathy for the people who shake him to death because [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4636.679999999999s)]
*  Before death it was like a roller coaster. It was like the most fun they've ever had. It's like oding. Yes [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4640.28s)]

*  Exactly and then you know, yeah, you gotta stir him I'd do more stirring just kind of kind of moving him around [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4650.2s)]
*  No, it's been awesome. I you asked me what my thoughts about fatherhood are [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4655.16s)]

*  You have no idea first off not pasteurized which you don't need to do that with milk. We drink within two weeks [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4962.44s)]
*  That is actually true. They basically purify milk. It's like shelf stabilized. It has no nutrients in it [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4966.84s)]
*  That's why it gives everyone fucking eczema. All right, just look into it. Yeah [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=4971.72s)]

*  I love bringing the baby everywhere. I am very arabic in that way. Yeah, I feel like arabs do that the best [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=5059.56s)]
*  I don't know if I wouldn't make that an arabic trait. Yeah, that's what the arabs are known for strapped into their chest [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=5066.12s)]
*  It's a job, I know it's really enjoyed that [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=5074.2s)]
*  He like [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=5079.5599999999995s)]

*  Okay, no, but I feel like arabs and dove is kind of an arab. I feel like arabs [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=5084.679999999999s)]
*  They take the babies out, you know, especially when it's like ramadan you see the whole family out [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=5090.5199999999995s)]

*  That you go out at night. I think that is also probably something to do with it [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=5099.56s)]
*  But I think culturally they just take the whole family ever you say they didn't do that too [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=5103.96s)]
*  Yeah, but I didn't know this young we're not going to bars and getting drunk [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=5107.240000000001s)]

*  I feel like you're not even considering. I don't think he saw the vision pro 2 to be honest. He was asleep [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=5130.04s)]
*  But I think he's been awake. I don't think he has vision [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=5133.96s)]

*  How about this when you die? What is the stereotype of how you die? What do people say you see a light you go into the light? [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=5380.12s)]

*  I'm finally getting on board. Maybe the light is just the pussy of the universe. You know, maybe you're flying through it [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=5403.16s)]
*  Think about it. That's why I said feel all the feels [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=5409.32s)]
*  To your friends they start shitting on your theories about life and then you feel insecure when you just had the greatest moment [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=5415.16s)]

*  I actually I can do that [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=5457.08s)]
*  No, they do these reflex testings where they're like, all right, the kid has a reflex to walk [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=5460.36s)]
*  They put him down and his legs will go like this and they'll start to walk and they have a hanging reflex where they know [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=5464.84s)]
*  How to hang on to shit that is they can hang that's yeah [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=5469.08s)]
*  It's they can do like pull-ups. Yeah, like somehow we get weaker. It's crazy. Yeah, and then they have like, uh [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=5471.96s)]

*  And it's like all that shit is programmed in there just baked in download it on the hard drive [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=5487.4800000000005s)]
*  Right when you buy it, like I don't think I my wife was just bleeding out. So I was trying to make sure she didn't die [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=5491.4s)]
*  I would have to take care of my baby all by myself. I was like, yo, you got that with the toes [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=5497.64s)]

*  She was very concerned. And so I think she was really protective and I didn't want to um, [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=5532.84s)]
*  Uh me immediately i'm like let's show the world the coolest thing that we've ever made [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqp05BTgZiw&t=5537.64s)]
