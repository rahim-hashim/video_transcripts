# Kendrick Halftime Show & How Reynolds/Lively Cancelled Themselves
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo)
*  What's up everybody? Welcome to Flay Grant. Listen, did you guys watch the Super Bowl? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=0.0s)]
*  I heard about it. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3.84s)]
*  You heard about it? What did you guys think? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4.64s)]
*  Bottom five experience of my life. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6.4s)]
*  Oh, why? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7.68s)]
*  I watched it with my wife who's from Philly and all her family who's from Philly. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=8.32s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=11.6s)]
*  They made an ice cream cake for me. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=12.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=13.84s)]
*  They said fly Eagles fly and then it had an eagle on it and my face on the cake. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=14.24s)]
*  And they're just chanting that stupid retard anthem. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Fly! I was like, oh my God. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=21.2s)]
*  I hope your wife bought it with your money too. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=23.6s)]
*  That makes me think about it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=25.28s)]
*  What other money is there? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=26.64s)]
*  Is there other money I'm unaware of? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=28.639999999999997s)]
*  Is there other money unbeknownst to me? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=30.64s)]
*  Savings? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=32.64s)]
*  Yeah, savings. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=33.36s)]
*  Savings. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Who's saving? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=34.8s)]
*  Be honest, did you still eat the ice cream cake? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=38.48s)]
*  Of course. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=40.08s)]
*  Yeah, dude. I got used to my feelings. That's what I'm gonna do. Stay on my diet once in this game, though. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=40.48s)]
*  What is your diet? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=46.56s)]
*  I just get fatter every year. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=47.36s)]
*  That's my diet. That's my diet. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=51.36s)]
*  There's been different versions of this diet. That's what I'm trying to understand. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  No, it's over, dude. That diet I lost weight, but it's too unsustainable. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=56.8s)]
*  What was the diet about? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=59.599999999999994s)]
*  Too unsustainable. He's losing too much weight. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=60.559999999999995s)]
*  It was like a protein fucking cereal pack every two hours and then one real meal. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=66.16s)]
*  And I ain't doing that. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=71.12s)]
*  For about a month you came in, you were drinking Sour Patch Kids beverages. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=72.0s)]
*  I lost weight doing that. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=75.36s)]
*  But there's no way. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=76.72s)]
*  There was. There was a way. It was just all fake. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=78.08s)]
*  He has to plant a special. With special taping. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=80.32s)]
*  If he plants a special, then he loses weight. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=82.8s)]
*  I will lose weight. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=84.32s)]
*  Arkos was chugging these. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  This is what he brought in. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=87.68s)]
*  While he's telling us he's on his diet. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=89.2s)]
*  Look at the nutrition facts. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=92.0s)]
*  That's a juice diet right there. I respect it. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=93.36s)]
*  Ow. What did you think of the halftime show? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=97.84s)]
*  Phenomenal. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=103.28s)]
*  You thought it was phenomenal? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=103.84s)]
*  I actually did like the halftime show. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=104.88s)]
*  Yeah, me too. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=106.72s)]
*  I liked it. Why is it? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=109.44s)]
*  It was a phenomenal show. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=110.8s)]
*  Why am I the worst? I'm trying to be objective here. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  No, you're not. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=116.32s)]
*  Listen, obviously there's been a little bit of smoke or whatever. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=117.2s)]
*  There's been a little bit of beef. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=119.6s)]
*  But outside of that, I can look at a performance and I can say it was good. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=120.64s)]
*  It was colorful. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=125.36s)]
*  Colorful. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=127.36s)]
*  Yeah, it was colorful. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=128.0s)]
*  It had a lot of symbolism. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=129.28s)]
*  Red, white and blue. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=131.84s)]
*  I had to read a few days later what that meant and it was like mind blowing. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  What did it symbolize? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=139.12s)]
*  It was the American flag. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=139.92s)]
*  Did you guys pick that up during it? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=141.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=143.52s)]
*  You did? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=143.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=144.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=144.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=145.12s)]
*  You did pick it up during it? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=145.44s)]
*  This guy. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=146.8s)]
*  Uh oh. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=147.44s)]
*  When you saw second one, I was like... [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=147.76s)]
*  Okay, okay, okay. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=149.44s)]
*  In all honesty, I thought it was all right. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=150.32s)]
*  I thought it was all right. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=153.12s)]
*  It was decent. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=153.84s)]
*  That's what I thought. I thought it was all right. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=154.32s)]
*  It was decent. I wish he had better song selection, but he did perform a lot of his [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=155.52s)]
*  best hits when he performed with Dre in Two Super Bowls ago. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=159.76s)]
*  Yeah, we just watched it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=163.04s)]
*  And he played like all those tracks that were popping at the time. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=164.64s)]
*  So he couldn't perform them again. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=166.88s)]
*  I mean, he could. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=168.64s)]
*  He could have, but I don't think he wanted to. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=169.6s)]
*  I also think my general feeling on all Super Bowl halftime shows is, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=172.88s)]
*  and we said this before, if you like the artist, you like the halftime show. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=176.16s)]
*  If you don't, you don't. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=179.6s)]
*  Usher, we all like Usher. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  We were like, that was maybe the greatest halftime show ever. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  What was your family's group text during the Usher performance? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=185.6s)]
*  Trashing it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=188.64s)]
*  I remember we talked about this on the farm. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=189.2s)]
*  Your friends that didn't love Usher were trashing it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=190.88s)]
*  Very few performances. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=193.68s)]
*  I didn't know anybody that trashed it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=194.48s)]
*  I didn't know anybody that trashed it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=197.51999999999998s)]
*  That was the greatest Super Bowl performance ever. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=198.56s)]
*  It's literally on record from a year ago. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=200.32s)]
*  We can just go back and watch it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=201.76s)]
*  My family didn't get it. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=204.08s)]
*  They were like, who is this guy and what is he talking about? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=204.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=206.88s)]
*  And that's impossible. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=207.38s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=208.48s)]
*  They thought it was fine. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=209.44s)]
*  They just have never heard the songs. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=210.72s)]
*  Like Usher, for my family, for French Canadians, it didn't cross over somehow. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=212.0s)]
*  If you don't like the artist, you probably don't, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=216.24s)]
*  almost certainly don't like the performance. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=218.8s)]
*  That's it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=220.72s)]
*  You're telling me that when your dad's running around gay bars in Paris, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=221.12s)]
*  he didn't listen to any Usher songs? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=224.8s)]
*  No. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=226.88s)]
*  Freddie Mercury or whatever is going on. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=229.04s)]
*  Gay bars in Paris. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  That's a Kanye song. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=232.72s)]
*  Ball so hard. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=235.68s)]
*  Yeah, it is a tricky endeavor, right? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=239.68s)]
*  You need to be so universal that everybody knows the songs. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=241.12s)]
*  There's a handful of people that can do it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=244.08s)]
*  And I guess to some people, Usher wasn't big enough. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=246.8s)]
*  Which is insane. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=249.76s)]
*  Which is insane to us. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  So who is big enough? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=252.24s)]
*  Is Pitbull big enough? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=253.44s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=255.68s)]
*  I think people trashed. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=256.4s)]
*  Dude, JLo and Shakira got trashed because people were like, what's JLo doing? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=257.44s)]
*  So it's Beyonce, Taylor Swift. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=261.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=263.91999999999996s)]
*  People who are too big, who feel like they're too big to do it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=264.56s)]
*  Adele Coldplay. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=268.71999999999997s)]
*  What if you did like a Medley? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=269.52s)]
*  Like Medley. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=271.2s)]
*  Medley would work. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=271.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  LA, I also think we brought up Dr. Dre. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=273.28s)]
*  They loved it in LA. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=276.64s)]
*  But it's also Dr. Dre and Snoop in LA. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=277.91999999999996s)]
*  So even if you're an out of town guy visiting LA, you understand how hype this is. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=281.12s)]
*  All right, then so to Kendrick's credit, instead of trying to win everybody over, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=284.8s)]
*  do you just try to win your base? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=289.2s)]
*  Yeah, he just did a show that was for his fans. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=290.64s)]
*  It was a little, did you see a little video of him just doing this after? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=292.40000000000003s)]
*  I think he got exactly what he wanted out of it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=295.52000000000004s)]
*  And he's always kind of been for his fans and that's it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=297.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=299.68s)]
*  But it is a weird thing because it's not your show. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=300.24s)]
*  It is weird. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=303.2s)]
*  It is weird. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=303.92s)]
*  Meaning that when you do your show for your fans, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=304.64s)]
*  people are coming to your show to watch you do whatever you think. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=308.0s)]
*  When you agree to go to the other people's show, those football players show, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=312.32s)]
*  you are trying to do a show for everyone else. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=316.08s)]
*  And I feel like speaking to some Kendrick fans that were let down, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  a lot of them said this, I didn't like the song choice. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=321.2s)]
*  Like they were making a lot of, I don't even want to call them excuses. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=323.12s)]
*  They just had criticisms about it. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=325.92s)]
*  And I think the overall feeling was, hey, this is our guy. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=327.36s)]
*  This is my guy and I want the world to know why I think he's so great. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=333.12s)]
*  And I think a lot of people felt let down about that. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=337.12s)]
*  This whole year they were like, I told you he's the best. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=340.23999999999995s)]
*  I've been riding with this dude for 10 years. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=342.23999999999995s)]
*  Look, he took out Drake, he annihilated him, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=344.08s)]
*  and he's about to do the Super Bowl and I'm gonna prove to all of you why he's the best. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=346.23999999999995s)]
*  And then to see people go, who is he? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=349.84s)]
*  I don't know these songs. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=352.15999999999997s)]
*  I don't even really know what he's saying. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=353.03999999999996s)]
*  I don't understand what's happening. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=354.23999999999995s)]
*  And he's not like jumping out of a cannon or doing something insane. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=355.84s)]
*  Like the choreography was cool, the videography was cool, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=359.11999999999995s)]
*  but there wasn't any like wild Michael Jackson-esque antics [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=361.44s)]
*  that could maybe help you cross over. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=366.0s)]
*  And so I think that's where even Kendrick fans were a little bit let down. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=369.04s)]
*  They wanted to prove to the world that he's the best. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=372.48s)]
*  And I don't think that that performance made the casuals go, yeah, he's the best. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=374.8s)]
*  Yeah, because I think to Al's point, and none of us thought of this until we rewatched, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=378.4s)]
*  we were just rewatching, like, oh, he did a lot of these songs two, three years ago. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=382.8s)]
*  So it's very recent history. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=387.6s)]
*  So that's where I think it's a little tough. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=389.44s)]
*  But I overall actually liked the performance. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=391.2s)]
*  Everybody I was with liked it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=393.2s)]
*  So that's why when I got, I saw some of the texts I was getting, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=394.88s)]
*  and then I went online, I was like, oh, there's a lot. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=397.68s)]
*  And then I just kind of clicked with me. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=399.52s)]
*  Like if Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, I remember not giving a fuck about that halftime show. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=400.72s)]
*  But if you're a Tom Petty fan, that's awesome. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=404.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=407.2s)]
*  This was great. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=407.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=408.24s)]
*  Prince, people say, is the best ever. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=408.64s)]
*  I liked Purple Rain, but I liked the song Purple Rain. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=410.72s)]
*  Looking back at a lot of the halftime shows, you kind of need one stadium anthem. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=412.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=416.96000000000004s)]
*  You need like a big orchestral, like shut down the thing. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=417.36s)]
*  You don't even need music, just let everyone sing type song to really win that. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=420.88s)]
*  So that was the other thing we were saying is like, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=424.32s)]
*  there are certain abilities that just cross over primally. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=426.96s)]
*  Like it doesn't matter how good you rap, it's not going to penetrate in the same way [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=430.08s)]
*  as like fucking Adele singing. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=434.0s)]
*  Adele singing. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=436.48s)]
*  Bruno Mars, I remember not being a huge fan watching that performance. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=437.04s)]
*  I mean like, oh, I just got... [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=439.84s)]
*  If you got pipes, bro, you could win people over that don't even know who you are. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=440.48s)]
*  That's why I like the national anthem. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=444.15999999999997s)]
*  Like if you have some girl singing the national anthem. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=445.36s)]
*  Whitney Houston does the national anthem. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=446.8s)]
*  I didn't know. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=447.92s)]
*  I remember being six years old or whatever watching her. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=448.64s)]
*  I didn't know who she was. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=451.12s)]
*  And I remember being like, this is awesome. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=451.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's Goosebumps. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=453.36s)]
*  But if you're a rapper, you don't have that. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=454.56s)]
*  That's not part of your repertoire. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=456.32s)]
*  So you could make the show extravagant and there are different versions of that. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=457.59999999999997s)]
*  Or you could have a universal smash hit. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=463.12s)]
*  Not Like Us is a universal smash hit. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=466.56s)]
*  I was humming it the rest of the day. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=469.76s)]
*  It's so fucking catchy. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=471.84s)]
*  Outside of that, there was no other song that was universal smash hit. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=473.68s)]
*  And outside of non-hip hop fans, no one knows Not Like Us. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=477.36s)]
*  That's another thing. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=481.84s)]
*  It's niche. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=483.12s)]
*  It's like this is we're having this conversation the other day. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=483.68s)]
*  It's like Bad Bunny is the biggest artist in the world, right? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=486.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=489.92s)]
*  He can't do the Super Bowl. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=490.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=491.44s)]
*  Don't you disrespect that. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=491.68s)]
*  Yeah, I just wanted to be honest with you. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=492.64s)]
*  I wanted to be honest with you. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=495.12s)]
*  The amount of white people playing Bad Bunny's album right now, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=496.24s)]
*  I think he could do the Super Bowl with this latest album. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=498.88s)]
*  Chance. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=501.04s)]
*  I think he could. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=501.52s)]
*  Al, you know New York whites. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=502.4s)]
*  They're half Puerto Rican. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=504.08s)]
*  Bro, he just sold out. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=505.36s)]
*  They just all like you don't know Toledo, Ohio white people playing Bad Bunny. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=506.4s)]
*  It's been a while since you've been on the road. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=512.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=513.76s)]
*  You can't get in the shit. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=514.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=515.92s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=516.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=516.72s)]
*  In the end, New Yorkers. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=516.96s)]
*  If you start playing Bad Bunny in Cleveland, there's going to be an issue. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=517.68s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=520.32s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=521.2s)]
*  I just don't think it's not universal. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=521.76s)]
*  You can be massive within groups, but the universality, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=524.96s)]
*  Pitbull sells less tickets than Kendrick. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=528.32s)]
*  More people know Pitbull songs across all genres. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=531.12s)]
*  Flowrider. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=534.96s)]
*  Flowrider? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=536.32s)]
*  This guy's got fucking... [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=536.96s)]
*  It sounds crazy. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=538.24s)]
*  Can you bring up Flowrider Spotify? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=539.44s)]
*  Unfortunately, I'll give you Pitbull, not Flowrider. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=540.96s)]
*  Stop it. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=544.24s)]
*  Stop it. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=544.5600000000001s)]
*  You're hating because the name is stupid, but the music is incredible. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=544.88s)]
*  It is stupid. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=548.32s)]
*  Bro, I mean, just in terms of bangers. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=548.8000000000001s)]
*  Flowrider is a bigger artist than Kendrick Lamar. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=551.36s)]
*  I'm just being honest with you. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=554.48s)]
*  I'm just being honest with you. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=556.08s)]
*  I thought you said you wasn't going to hate today. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=556.8000000000001s)]
*  That's not hate. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=559.0400000000001s)]

*  Flowrider is like one of them dancing Asians that wear the masks. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=570.32s)]

*  I don't know. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=605.76s)]

*  It's an idea, bro. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=611.6s)]

*  Wait, what? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=623.6800000000001s)]
*  That's not even... [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=624.08s)]
*  No, that's not him? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=624.88s)]
*  This one. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=626.96s)]

*  Bro, I'm telling you. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=628.8s)]
*  He would shut it down. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=629.4399999999999s)]
*  Oh, actually, I think that is so. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=630.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you thought it was Kevin Gates? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=631.5999999999999s)]
*  Come on, bro. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=632.8s)]
*  Yeah, I did think it was Kevin Gates. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=633.28s)]
*  Come on, bro. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=634.64s)]
*  Anyway, so who can do... [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=635.68s)]
*  Well, Drake. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=637.12s)]
*  Drake could do it. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=637.5999999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's the reality. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=638.16s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=639.4399999999999s)]
*  I think, again, I don't know that he could. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=640.3199999999999s)]
*  I'll tell you who could actually do it. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=641.76s)]
*  Kanye. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=643.3599999999999s)]
*  Oh. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=644.16s)]
*  Kanye could actually do it. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=644.4799999999999s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=645.76s)]
*  Actually do it. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=646.24s)]
*  And I think you might understand this. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=646.88s)]
*  Kanye would have probably the most epic... [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=647.52s)]
*  It would be the last Super Bowl, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=650.0s)]
*  but it would be the most epic Super Bowl. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=651.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=652.9599999999999s)]
*  The last and greatest. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=653.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it would be the last. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=655.2s)]
*  They would stop the Super Bowl after that. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=655.92s)]
*  100%. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=657.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's why. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=658.08s)]
*  It would be over. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=659.44s)]
*  Imagine putting an end to the Super Bowl halftime show. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=660.08s)]
*  There would be no more Super Bowl halftime shows. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=662.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't think they would let black people [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=664.64s)]
*  even play in the Super Bowl after that. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=666.08s)]
*  But Kanye is the only rapper I can think of who can... [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=669.6s)]
*  His stadium anthems, he understands. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=672.64s)]
*  Nah, Drake could do it too. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=674.48s)]
*  The orchestra's coming in like he said, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=675.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=676.72s)]
*  10 years, Travis Scott. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=677.76s)]
*  Travis Scott. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=679.6s)]
*  10 years, Travis Scott. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=680.32s)]
*  Travis Scott. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=681.12s)]
*  But if Drake did all his collabs [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=682.24s)]
*  and he just brought out Breon, this person, that person, this person, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=683.76s)]
*  then it's a crazy show. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=687.36s)]
*  Then he does it. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=687.92s)]
*  Drake, and that's one thing I will say, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=689.04s)]
*  I wish Kendrick brought in collabs for sure. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=690.3199999999999s)]
*  Drake, if he brings in collabs, yes, absolutely. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=692.8s)]
*  So imagine Wayne did it, right, and brought in the collabs. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=694.8s)]
*  So imagine Wayne brings in Nicki, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=700.4s)]
*  Wayne brings in Drake. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=702.64s)]
*  Juvenile. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=703.84s)]
*  Juvenile. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=704.48s)]
*  Oh my God, juvenile, that would be nuts. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=705.2s)]
*  I still think it would have been one of those things [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=707.68s)]
*  only hip hop bands would have liked [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=709.52s)]
*  that everyone else would have been like. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=710.72s)]
*  But if you take that ass up crossover, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=711.4399999999999s)]
*  that's the only one. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=713.6800000000001s)]
*  But if it's in New Orleans, Al, that does help. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=714.96s)]
*  Then the same way Drain Snoop in LA went crazy, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=718.08s)]
*  I think the issue from what I was seeing, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=720.72s)]
*  some of the recent Wayne performances [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=722.96s)]
*  are not like what we know Wayne to be. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=724.32s)]
*  We know Wayne is like peak Wayne. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=726.1600000000001s)]
*  I'm just trying to think of who would get Mark's family to get excited. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=728.48s)]
*  And I don't think of Wayne performances. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=732.6400000000001s)]
*  Kanye, they would love Kanye, dude. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=733.7600000000001s)]
*  Garth Brooks. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=735.2s)]
*  They probably love Kanye now more than ever. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=735.7600000000001s)]
*  He might need Garth Brooks. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=737.2800000000001s)]
*  I've seen Garth at the Super Bowl. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=738.96s)]
*  I think he did. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=741.2800000000001s)]
*  I think he did one of the Cowboys ones. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=741.92s)]
*  I think 95. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=743.8399999999999s)]
*  I think it's from your residency. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=744.56s)]
*  I think every year. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=746.0799999999999s)]
*  Garth again, isn't it great? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=749.4399999999999s)]
*  Like when I was a kid. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=750.64s)]
*  We gotta go see Garth. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=751.4399999999999s)]
*  We gotta go see Garth. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=753.4399999999999s)]
*  Right? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=754.4s)]
*  I got no problem. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=754.88s)]
*  Thunder Rolls fire. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=755.68s)]
*  I need to see like a proper country. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=756.7199999999999s)]
*  No, what is that thing called? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=759.04s)]
*  Stagecoach? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=760.56s)]

*  I feel like she misses them. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1187.52s)]
*  She wasn't at the pop out though. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1188.9599999999998s)]
*  She wasn't at the pop out show. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1191.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1192.8799999999999s)]

*  I don't give a fuck what it is. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1208.64s)]
*  If Jordan's playing tic tac toe with you and you beat him once, I'm not forgetting that. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1209.8400000000001s)]
*  So what's the best way to get Drake back if you're Serena? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1213.2s)]
*  Super Bowl halftime show. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1216.5600000000002s)]

*  That's the only way to get Drake back. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1226.48s)]
*  There's enough of those. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1229.0400000000002s)]

*  That's an alleged leak. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1236.72s)]
*  It's like a Starkson joke. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1237.92s)]
*  I know what I'm saying. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1238.96s)]
*  He goes too far. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1240.0s)]
*  This guy is convinced. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1241.44s)]
*  I go too far. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1242.48s)]

*  That's a good point. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1244.96s)]
*  Serena also has a perfect cover to be like, no, I didn't do it for the Drake that I did it [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1246.96s)]
*  because I'm from Compton. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1249.7600000000002s)]

*  Just briefly, were the Eagles just that much better, or did the Chiefs suck? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1600.96s)]
*  That much better. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1603.36s)]
*  Also, here's what. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1604.08s)]
*  This one guy, Brian Baldinger, very smart football guy. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1605.04s)]
*  Basically brought up that no matter how great a quarterback is, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1607.6799999999998s)]
*  the way you normally pressure them is you send a blitz, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1611.04s)]
*  meaning you have your four linemen and then you send another guy to put pressure on them. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1613.52s)]
*  Any great quarterback will eat you up a few blitz. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1617.4399999999998s)]
*  But if those front four linemen can cause hell for the quarterback, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1619.6799999999998s)]
*  that's how the Giants beat Brady. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1623.28s)]
*  That's how the Bucks beat Mahomes. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1624.7199999999998s)]
*  And that's how the Eagles dominated the Chiefs. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1626.08s)]
*  The Chiefs weren't as good as they used to be. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1628.8s)]
*  They were eating up that line. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1630.1599999999999s)]
*  But Mahomes is still so good. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1631.28s)]
*  But if your four linemen, especially the left tackle on the Chiefs, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1633.36s)]
*  which is maybe the most important linemen, has been bad all year, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1636.56s)]
*  and somehow they kept winning and getting away with it, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1639.52s)]
*  and then the Eagles, their defensive ends are really good, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1641.44s)]
*  just single-handedly that line, especially that position, destroyed the game. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1646.0s)]
*  And Mahomes had no time to find anybody and the rest of the team is not as good. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1649.6799999999998s)]
*  So it was just a dominating, horrible day of my life. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1652.56s)]
*  And that's just really God's way of telling me. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1656.08s)]
*  That plus Luca is like God's way of saying life. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1658.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you had a tough week. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1660.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you had a tough week. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1661.6s)]
*  You know, God has like an 8 billion point plan. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1663.44s)]
*  One of his points is this little fat Indian kid needs to get on Ozempic [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1666.24s)]
*  and stop watching so much sports. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1668.8799999999999s)]
*  Really get his life together. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1670.0s)]
*  Because the Luca trade, we haven't talked about it in public. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1672.72s)]
*  I'm so fucking broken for this. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1674.6399999999999s)]
*  I've never seen an organization do this. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1675.92s)]
*  How do you play with the Lakers? [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1677.36s)]
*  I didn't watch the game last night. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1678.16s)]
*  It was fun. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1679.2s)]
*  I didn't. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1679.76s)]
*  I watched it. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1680.3999999999999s)]
*  It was good? [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1680.96s)]
*  Yeah, it was fun. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1681.6s)]
*  He had a really great moment where LeBron's on a fast break. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1682.16s)]
*  LeBron looks way younger. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1684.3999999999999s)]
*  First game with Luca and he's on a fast break. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1685.68s)]
*  And Luca looks up court and sees him and literally big smile tosses it up to LeBron. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1687.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1691.84s)]
*  I mean, it's going to be awesome. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1692.24s)]
*  Been watching that guy for 20 years and you get to throw him an alley-oop. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1693.36s)]
*  It's always fun. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1696.7199999999998s)]
*  I mean. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1697.4399999999998s)]
*  Also, I was at the Knicks game and it was Knicks-Lakers. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1698.1599999999999s)]
*  It is so hard as a 41-year-old man to not root for LeBron. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1702.4799999999998s)]
*  Like everything he did, I was like, get them young motherfuckers. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1707.36s)]
*  Like I was just so excited for him. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1710.8799999999999s)]
*  I couldn't believe it. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1713.1999999999998s)]
*  Like I would get up after sitting down and my knees would hurt. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1714.08s)]
*  Right? [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1717.9199999999998s)]
*  I'm sitting down and I'm drinking tequila and I would get up and I'd be like, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1718.1599999999999s)]
*  I can't celebrate that much. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1722.0s)]
*  It had to be a big play for me to get up. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1723.76s)]
*  Right? [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1725.92s)]
*  And the Knicks were down the majority of the game. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1726.4s)]
*  I think we were down 14 and we hit some three and I got up at one point. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1728.24s)]
*  I was really excited and I got back down. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1731.44s)]
*  I was like, that's all I'm getting up for the rest of the game. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1732.72s)]
*  And I'm watching LeBron dunk from the fucking dotted line. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1734.72s)]
*  That sounds crazy. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1737.68s)]
*  You went home to your wife. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1738.32s)]
*  She was like, how was watching LeBron? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1739.12s)]
*  You're like, babe, my knees hurt so bad. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1740.24s)]
*  My knees. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1741.28s)]
*  My knees are killing me. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1742.96s)]
*  So it was like, yeah, I don't know. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1744.24s)]
*  It's just. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1745.68s)]
*  He had a triple double. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1746.0s)]
*  Who did? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1747.36s)]
*  LeBron in that game. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1747.84s)]
*  LeBron. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1748.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1749.04s)]
*  I mean, he was just phenomenal. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1749.12s)]
*  So it's. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1750.1599999999999s)]
*  I am rooting for him. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1751.28s)]
*  I'm rooting for him as an old man. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1752.2399999999998s)]
*  I'm rooting for Luca. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1753.4399999999998s)]
*  I'm rooting for LeBron. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1754.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm rooting for LeBron the way Chinese people rooted for Jeremy Lin. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1755.12s)]
*  I don't feel representation in the league. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1762.1599999999999s)]
*  And now that I see LeBron just dunking on people at 40, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1764.9599999999998s)]
*  I'm like, I could do that shit with paddle. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1768.08s)]
*  All things are possible. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1772.9599999999998s)]
*  All things are possible. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1774.0s)]
*  I need to be on whatever he's on. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1775.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1776.7199999999998s)]
*  He's Barack for 40 year old men. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1777.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1778.64s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't know this was possible. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1779.2s)]
*  It's just so amazing to see. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1780.64s)]
*  It's amazing to see. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1782.64s)]
*  I feel like such a piece of shit when I come home from work and like [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1783.68s)]
*  my daughter wants to run around and I'm like, why don't we just stay in a playpen? [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1786.72s)]
*  I can control you in the playpen. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1790.96s)]
*  And then I see LeBron just talking for the fucking free throw line. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1792.96s)]
*  Yeah, he sees it. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1795.76s)]
*  Jackie Robinson of old guys. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1796.5600000000002s)]
*  He really is, dude. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1797.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1798.88s)]
*  He broke the age barrier. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1799.1200000000001s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1800.48s)]
*  Yeah, not a lot of people yelling shit at him. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1802.0800000000002s)]
*  I'm broken. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1806.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was crazy. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1806.64s)]
*  It was also crazy to see like people root for Bronny. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1807.28s)]
*  But Bron, they were the whole garden notorious haters like boo. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1810.56s)]
*  If you're bad at the national anthem, like in the middle, they're like yelling shit out. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1815.92s)]
*  They're cheering for Bronny to come on. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1822.08s)]
*  He comes on, hits a layup and they go crazy. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1823.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1826.32s)]
*  I would think New York would maybe boo him. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1827.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1829.76s)]
*  Yeah, I'm surprised about that. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1830.3999999999999s)]
*  If he's playing alone without LeBron, booing him. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1831.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1833.92s)]
*  But it's bigger than basketball. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1834.3999999999999s)]
*  It's a story. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1836.72s)]
*  New Yorkers love family. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1837.52s)]
*  It's like Fast and Furious. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1839.76s)]
*  There is something about that though. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1840.88s)]
*  He seems like a good kid, man. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1843.3600000000001s)]
*  I played well in the G League, so it's not like he sucks. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1846.16s)]
*  And he's got the highest expectation of any player in history [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1849.1200000000001s)]
*  without the expectation of the skill. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1852.16s)]
*  So like everybody goes, oh, Bronny sucks. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1854.8s)]
*  And then when he doesn't play amazing, they're like, he fucking sucks. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1856.96s)]
*  It's like every like 90% of the players that are drafted, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1860.72s)]

*  Yeah, yeah, it's over now. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1930.08s)]
*  I like betting on sports. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1931.9199999999998s)]
*  I won my Super Bowl box. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1933.04s)]
*  What was your box? [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1935.52s)]
*  0-2. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1937.6799999999998s)]
*  Like I won the final score on my Super Bowl box. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1939.12s)]
*  It's fun, right? [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1942.96s)]
*  How does that work? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1945.6s)]
*  So basically you just get two numbers and that has to be the score. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1946.56s)]
*  At the end of the quarter, end of the half, end of the game. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1950.1599999999999s)]
*  So if it's like 12 to 7, whoever had 2 and 7 ends up winning. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1953.12s)]
*  And it's a fun way to keep people interested in the game [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1959.76s)]
*  even if you don't have a team in play. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1962.08s)]
*  That zero held up for quite some time. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1964.6399999999999s)]
*  I didn't even see when it happened. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1969.36s)]
*  I had left because I think the score was right at the end. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1970.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I couldn't leave. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1974.0s)]
*  Can we bet on Akash's happiness? [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1976.9599999999998s)]
*  Is that possible on stake? [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1978.7199999999998s)]
*  Fucking negative. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1980.1599999999999s)]
*  I would take the over on him just being miserable forever. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1980.96s)]
*  Just watching sports. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1984.96s)]
*  Tug, these young kids who are like, I support the players, they got it. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1986.08s)]
*  My brother was saying that. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1989.04s)]
*  The team fuck you all the time. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1990.16s)]
*  LeBron is never gonna let me down. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1991.8400000000001s)]
*  The organization, some fucking retard who can't even run a casino properly [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1993.6000000000001s)]
*  when gambling is legal, he could buy your team and trade your best player. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=1997.1200000000001s)]
*  Fucking gopher looking motherfucker could do that. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2000.72s)]
*  But that was Nico that did that. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2002.72s)]
*  Nico did it but the owner signed off and the owner said, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2004.0s)]
*  hey, if you don't work hard, if you look at all the greats in our time like Shaq, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2006.56s)]
*  they worked hard. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2009.92s)]
*  Shaq says all the time, I never worked hard. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2010.88s)]
*  He's like, I didn't work on the off season. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2012.72s)]
*  I use the regular season to get in shape. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2014.24s)]

*  It just lets me know you don't know anything. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2020.48s)]
*  Apparently also, if you say anything negative, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2022.24s)]
*  if you're wearing anything remotely negative that kick you out of the stadium, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2024.48s)]

*  because they were so worried they were going to say negative things. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2029.52s)]

*  according to an inside source, which is a release of TMZ this morning. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2166.96s)]
*  She's smart. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2170.0s)]

*  It's a great book. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2200.08s)]
*  Write books for women, because once one is popular, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2201.2s)]
*  every single woman devours that shit. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2204.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2206.16s)]
*  Fourth Wing, it ends with us. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2206.8s)]
*  I think there's another one. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2208.4s)]
*  I told you about... [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2209.76s)]
*  What's that? [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2210.7200000000003s)]
*  A Court of Thorn and Roses was big. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2211.28s)]
*  Outlander, remember I told you about this? [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2213.44s)]
*  My girl read all of Outlander, which is the most insane show. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2215.28s)]
*  It's not a TV show? [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2217.92s)]
*  It is a TV show. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2218.64s)]
*  It was a book originally. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2219.44s)]
*  And it's about a woman that goes back in time [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2220.96s)]
*  so that she can cheat on her husband consensually. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2222.88s)]
*  It's literally the whole thing is time travel is real, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2226.56s)]
*  so she can fuck an old Scotsman and justify cheating. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2228.4s)]
*  That's the entire book. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2232.2400000000002s)]
*  My wife's like, it's just amazing. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2233.04s)]
*  It's like history. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2234.0s)]
*  I need to touch. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2234.56s)]
*  I was like, what? [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2235.2000000000003s)]
*  No, it's not history. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2235.84s)]
*  I love this concept. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2237.04s)]
*  It is kind of fire. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2238.4s)]
*  But the first season goes so crazy. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2239.12s)]
*  They're like, Elon, what you doing? [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2241.12s)]
*  Make some fucking time travel. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2242.48s)]
*  If I could double the number of women I've had sex with. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2244.2400000000002s)]
*  And the first season goes so crazy. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2248.64s)]
*  It starts in World War II, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2250.08s)]
*  goes back to the Battle of Culloden [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2251.28s)]
*  where the Scottish try to get independence, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2252.8s)]
*  and then they also do the American Revolution [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2254.32s)]
*  in the same season. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2256.8s)]
*  You said a lot of words. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2257.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's a whole lot of shit. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2258.7200000000003s)]
*  It's history plus cheating. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2259.84s)]
*  It's fire. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2261.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2262.32s)]
*  But anyway, so basically they make this book. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2262.8s)]
*  You guys... [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2264.88s)]
*  It ends with us. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2265.36s)]
*  You guys read it. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2266.1600000000003s)]
*  Justin Baldoni, who's an actor, hot guy, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2266.56s)]
*  but he's like really big into like not... [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2270.16s)]
*  He's a stud. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2271.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2272.7999999999997s)]
*  He's a really handsome guy. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2273.12s)]
*  He's like very like, what is masculinity? [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2274.7999999999997s)]
*  And I listened to a little podcast he did. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2277.68s)]
*  Attractive people, I don't really listen when they talk. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2279.6s)]
*  I just object to what I'm saying. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2282.72s)]
*  I gave this one a chance and I was actually impressed. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2283.52s)]
*  Oh, really? You started listening to it? [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2285.52s)]
*  I started listening. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2286.96s)]
*  I was like 10 minutes before I was like, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2287.6s)]
*  I need to see him. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2289.36s)]
*  Yeah, I just need to jerk off. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2290.16s)]
*  Yeah, I gotta break out a little bit. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2291.2799999999997s)]
*  You got a edge, dude. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2292.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2293.36s)]
*  But he's basically like, you know, what is masculinity? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2294.0s)]
*  And like I think he's like, I don't like the term toxic masculinity. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2296.64s)]
*  It's too like political and masculinity is not toxic. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2299.28s)]
*  So he's not like a complete cuck. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2301.92s)]
*  He talks like an actor was a little annoying, [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2303.36s)]
*  but he's like, I just think... [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2305.2s)]
*  I like that angle though. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2306.72s)]
*  Yeah, he's like, man, if you have trauma, you should work through it [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2307.68s)]
*  because most of the time you're with your girl, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2310.08s)]
*  you could do a lot more damage to her if you don't work through your trauma [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2312.0s)]
*  than she could do to you. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2314.24s)]
*  What was his trauma? Did he talk about that? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2314.72s)]
*  No, I didn't listen. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2316.4s)]
*  He does have some trauma. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2316.88s)]
*  What's his trauma? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2318.08s)]
*  So he was... [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2319.04s)]
*  He says that he was sexually assaulted as a young man. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2320.72s)]
*  I get that though. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2324.4s)]
*  I think she was older by a woman and that's how he lost his virginity. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2326.8s)]
*  And it was not really... [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2329.04s)]
*  20? [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2329.84s)]
*  Yeah, he wasn't really consensual. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2330.48s)]
*  She kind of like coerced him into it and then he felt guilty and has trauma from that. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2331.76s)]
*  That's a part of it. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2334.6400000000003s)]
*  He was also introduced to porn at a young age. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2335.28s)]
*  I think he was like 12 when he was introduced to porn. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2337.6800000000003s)]
*  That's everybody. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2339.76s)]
*  Guys, guys, guys, guys. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2340.56s)]
*  I got a sex problem. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2343.28s)]
*  He had a porn addiction as well that he talked about that he recovered from. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2344.4s)]
*  This is how you recover from it. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2348.4s)]
*  Edging. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2350.32s)]
*  So you just never come and you're not addicted anymore. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2351.76s)]
*  Wait, 12 times in a day, is that a problem? [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2354.32s)]
*  12 times. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2360.7200000000003s)]
*  But that's my record though. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2362.32s)]
*  I was going for it. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2364.56s)]
*  That's the most I could do. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2365.84s)]
*  But he gets the rights to this book like five years ago. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2366.88s)]
*  Like he's emailing the author Colleen Hoover like, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2369.28s)]
*  hey, I'm starting this production company. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2371.6800000000003s)]
*  I would love to make a book about this. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2373.6800000000003s)]
*  I think it's important. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2374.7200000000003s)]

*  And then, but OK, back to this. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2590.8s)]
*  On the way to Russia, they didn't listen to the country [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2592.8s)]
*  for being gay. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2594.64s)]
*  And we had to go home. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2595.36s)]
*  That was crazy. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2596.2400000000002s)]
*  Dad, remember when they asked us about that? [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2597.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2599.2s)]
*  They were like, oh, you have a black friend who's very gay. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2599.52s)]
*  He was crying on the movie. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2603.44s)]
*  Then we put him on the plane. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2604.64s)]
*  How did you get around that, Al? [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2606.32s)]
*  I don't remember. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2608.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2609.12s)]
*  I don't remember this. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2609.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2610.16s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2610.64s)]
*  You don't remember a lot of our travels. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2611.8399999999997s)]
*  No. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2613.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2613.68s)]
*  It's so weird. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2614.48s)]
*  It's so weird. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2615.2s)]
*  Yeah, it is a little blur, isn't it? [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2616.24s)]
*  So he makes that movie. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2617.44s)]
*  Such a crazy blur. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2618.8799999999997s)]
*  He makes that movie. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2620.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2620.8799999999997s)]
*  And he shows that to Colleen Hoover. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2621.3599999999997s)]
*  And she's like, you're amazing. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2623.2799999999997s)]
*  You're perfect for my book. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2624.24s)]
*  And they go ahead and get into pre-production for the movie. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2625.92s)]
*  They get Sony to be the partner to actually make [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2628.24s)]
*  the movie come together. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2630.16s)]
*  And then it's produced and directed by Justin Baldoni [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2631.2s)]
*  and his company Wayfarer Studios. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2634.3199999999997s)]
*  Coincidentally, it also is starring Justin Baldoni. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2636.3199999999997s)]
*  Fire. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2638.7999999999997s)]
*  Does he play the abuser? [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2639.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2640.88s)]
*  And so the book, could you explain what you know about the book? [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2641.44s)]
*  This girl meets this guy in high school. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2644.56s)]
*  She's from an abusive household, wildly, violently abusive. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2646.88s)]
*  This guy is homeless. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2650.16s)]
*  And then they form a friendship that turns into something more. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2651.44s)]
*  They drift apart. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2654.32s)]
*  College, whatever. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2655.52s)]
*  They move, I guess. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2656.32s)]
*  And then she falls in love with this guy who's kind of- [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2657.12s)]
*  A nice guy. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2659.36s)]
*  He seems nice, but he's also- [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2660.24s)]
*  He's a neurosurgeon. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2661.12s)]
*  Neurosurgeon, handsome. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2662.08s)]
*  Does all these things that are kind of possessive. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2663.12s)]
*  But she didn't really catch the red flags earlier, whatever. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2664.88s)]
*  They get married, have a kid. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2667.6s)]
*  He becomes more abusive. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2669.04s)]
*  He sexually assaults her at one point. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2670.48s)]
*  That's Baldoni? [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2672.16s)]
*  Yeah, and they have a baby. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2673.2799999999997s)]
*  And then at the end, the decision she makes, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2674.32s)]
*  you should know this, I'm not spoiling anything, [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2676.8s)]
*  is she leaves him, it ends with us. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2678.24s)]
*  The cycle of abuse and violence that I grew up with is gonna end with this. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2680.16s)]
*  I'm not gonna let my kids see this. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2682.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2683.84s)]
*  It's a fairly dark movie. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2684.56s)]
*  Yeah, that seems pretty dark. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2686.32s)]
*  There's romance, but it's pretty dark. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2687.44s)]
*  And so that's important to note. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2689.68s)]
*  We're supposed to believe that she left Baldoni. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2691.6s)]
*  Is that what we're supposed to do? [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2695.12s)]
*  It's funny, my wife was showing me TikToks after of a bunch of girls [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2695.84s)]
*  being like, a bunch of girls left the movie being like, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2698.16s)]
*  leaving the movie knowing I'd take him back. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2700.3199999999997s)]
*  I'd take him back. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2701.7599999999998s)]
*  I was like, beat once a month? [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2702.48s)]
*  You get to walk around with him every day? [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2705.3599999999997s)]
*  Neurosurgeon? [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2707.12s)]
*  Neurosurgeon. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2707.92s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2708.72s)]
*  So that's what the book's about, which is important to note, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2714.08s)]
*  because it comes up later with all the backlash that Lively gets. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2716.3999999999996s)]
*  So basically Baldoni, Wayfair, and Sony approach Lively. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2718.96s)]
*  They get her cast as the main character, as Lily. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2722.24s)]
*  So. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2726.16s)]
*  Which in immediately, my understanding, even my wife was like, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2726.64s)]
*  I don't, she's like a fan of Gossip Girl and all that. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2729.7599999999998s)]
*  She's like, I don't love this casting. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2732.0s)]
*  She's a bit too old to play this girl in high school and like, or whatever. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2733.44s)]
*  Just like, it doesn't work. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2736.24s)]
*  It doesn't work to me. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2737.36s)]
*  But everybody feels that way. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2738.08s)]
*  I guess so. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2739.2s)]
*  I guess a lot of fans are generally like that. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2739.68s)]
*  Tom Hanks was cast as Da Vinci Code. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2741.2s)]
*  I was tight. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2744.08s)]
*  But that haircut ruined that whole movie. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2744.88s)]
*  No, it wasn't the haircut. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2746.32s)]
*  It was like, when I was watching it, I just imagined him being so handsome. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2747.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2750.0s)]
*  I imagine Richard Gere. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2750.64s)]
*  I read all those books. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2752.4s)]
*  I read Angels and Demons. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2753.52s)]
*  I read every one of those damn brown books. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2754.8s)]
*  Again. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2756.48s)]
*  Coming in hot. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2757.84s)]
*  Can I tell you something? [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2758.96s)]
*  Flaming hot. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2760.0s)]
*  Did you imagine Tom Hanks? [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2763.76s)]
*  No, but I wasn't mad because he wasn't handsome enough. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2765.76s)]
*  I was furious. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2767.92s)]
*  And then when he got cast, I was like, that's fire. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2769.1200000000003s)]
*  But then that stupid haircut ruined it. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2771.1200000000003s)]
*  The haircut was crazy. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2772.5600000000004s)]
*  The haircut was crazy. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2773.28s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2774.0800000000004s)]
*  All right. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2775.2000000000003s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2775.6800000000003s)]
*  But Tom Hanks in like a tweed jacket, like, I don't, you know, [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2776.0s)]
*  but Richard Gere in the other hand, do you know what I mean? [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2778.7200000000003s)]
*  The guy was piping Crawford. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2781.1200000000003s)]
*  Miles in a corner. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2782.32s)]
*  Miles Newhouse. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2783.28s)]
*  Miles Newhouse. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2784.16s)]
*  He got excited. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2784.64s)]
*  Miles, who'd you want him to be? [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2785.2s)]
*  Christian Bale or something. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2788.08s)]
*  Yeah, like a hot guy. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2789.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, like Christian Bale popping back then. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2790.24s)]
*  He had an American Psycho, but that's it. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2791.2799999999997s)]
*  Anyway, go ahead. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2792.48s)]
*  I had a body in American Psycho though. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2793.12s)]
*  Basically. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2795.52s)]
*  I had a body. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2796.08s)]
*  My man. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2797.12s)]
*  They start going crazy. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2797.8399999999997s)]
*  Another one, like, you know what I mean? [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2798.24s)]
*  All right. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2799.6s)]

*  Like, another one. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2801.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2803.2s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2803.68s)]
*  It's what it is. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2806.16s)]
*  What is that called? [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2807.44s)]
*  You know, murder me. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2808.24s)]
*  This is it. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2810.08s)]
*  This is why female serial killers, it could be the easiest job in the world. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2814.7999999999997s)]
*  Right? [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2818.8799999999997s)]
*  Like, remembering that girl, what was her name? [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2819.12s)]
*  She killed like four. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2821.12s)]
*  Eileen Warnos. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2821.52s)]
*  Eileen, she killed like four. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2822.08s)]
*  And it was like, all right. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2823.2799999999997s)]
*  Like, we're supposed to be impressed by that number. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2825.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2827.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2828.56s)]
*  There we go. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2829.92s)]
*  So basically, they do the movie, they start getting a pre-production. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2830.64s)]
*  OK? [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2833.52s)]
*  Again, everything I'm about to say also is allegedly, [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2834.56s)]
*  there's lawsuits flying everywhere. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2837.3599999999997s)]
*  I don't want to get embroiled in this. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2838.8799999999997s)]
*  It's all allegedly. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2839.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm also- [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2840.72s)]
*  Hey, embroil us, Mark. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2841.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm trying to also be unbiased, OK? [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2842.32s)]
*  Because if the allegations are true and Blake Lively was sexually harassed, that's bad. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2844.32s)]
*  But if Baldoni's whole career is getting skewered- [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2849.6000000000004s)]
*  It could be worse, but it's bad. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2851.84s)]
*  Just kidding. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2853.2000000000003s)]
*  It could be worse. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2853.76s)]
*  It's bad. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2855.28s)]
*  It could be worse, but it's bad. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2856.48s)]
*  That's all I'm saying. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2858.6400000000003s)]
*  Could be worse. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2859.76s)]
*  Like, I could be sexually harassed on her? [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2860.4s)]
*  That's worse. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2861.92s)]
*  That's worse. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2862.48s)]
*  Yeah, and more likely. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2863.28s)]
*  That's way worse. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2864.0800000000004s)]
*  Stereotypically slightly more like- [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2869.2000000000003s)]
*  Why you got a headband? [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2870.64s)]
*  Why you got a headband? [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2871.84s)]
*  That is crazy. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2873.12s)]
*  That is crazy. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2874.08s)]
*  The last thing you see is your big beautiful eyes. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2875.36s)]
*  Give me vagene and bald! [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2878.64s)]
*  Give me vagene and bald! [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2880.64s)]
*  Give us some big sexual harassment you learned back home. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2888.48s)]
*  Give us- [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2891.2s)]
*  It was like that cat from Alice in Wonderland. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2895.52s)]
*  He gets it high. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2897.68s)]
*  All right, go. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2901.52s)]
*  So this is going into pre-production, right? [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2902.08s)]
*  And they're going back and forth. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2904.64s)]
*  They have the script basically done. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2905.84s)]
*  And then slowly it seems like there's things that are coming up that are potentially red flags. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2907.7599999999998s)]
*  Now there's also a piece of this that I think is very important. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2912.24s)]
*  Blake Lively, prior to doing the movie, like months before, just had her fourth child. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2914.7999999999997s)]
*  Wow. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2920.08s)]
*  So she just delivered a baby and she's now raising a newborn while on the set, [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2920.4s)]
*  but also is recovering from nine months of pregnancy. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2924.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2928.24s)]
*  Which I think is a big part of this that I think some people leave out. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2928.88s)]
*  So they start getting into pre-production and then slowly she starts to kind of like [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2932.56s)]
*  not be super easy to work with. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2936.48s)]
*  It seems like according to the text that Baldoni's released. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2938.1600000000003s)]
*  So she hasn't read the book. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2940.88s)]
*  That's a problem. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2943.44s)]
*  And initially, and I don't know if she reads it later, but according to the text, [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2944.56s)]
*  in the pre-production she hasn't read the book. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2948.1600000000003s)]
*  She wants to just be living in the script and be married to the character in the script. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2949.76s)]
*  Actually I like that. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2952.88s)]
*  Can I be honest with you? [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2953.52s)]
*  Excuse me, lazy. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2954.32s)]
*  That's what I say to every movie when I don't want to read the whole script. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2955.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2959.6s)]
*  I go, I just don't want to know what happens next because my character wouldn't know. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2960.16s)]
*  I swear that's the excuse I use every single time. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2963.4399999999996s)]
*  I'm just too lazy to read it and I usually read it after and I'm like, oh, that happened? [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2965.52s)]
*  Like I didn't even know I was gay in that TV show on Hulu. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2970.0s)]
*  I showed up today and I had my hands on the wall and I was like, what the fuck is this about? [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2973.6s)]
*  I'm just as surprised as you. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2978.16s)]
*  You weren't annoyed when they were like, you're perfect for the role. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2979.4399999999996s)]
*  Like you are. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2981.2799999999997s)]
*  Well after that, now they're too mean. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2982.08s)]
*  Perfect. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2983.68s)]
*  Did we listen to his podcast or something? [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2984.08s)]
*  And then there's another thing that happens early on that's a little bit of a red flag. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2988.48s)]
*  Baldoni is really, really strict on getting an intimacy coordinator. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2991.7599999999998s)]
*  He wants an intimacy coordinator. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2994.72s)]
*  This is someone that comes into the production that is able to supervise all the sex scenes. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=2996.96s)]
*  To make sure nobody feels uncomfortable. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3001.84s)]
*  And also to coordinate the sex scenes so that they play more realistically [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3003.2799999999997s)]
*  and that they sort of can tap into the audience that they're trying to reach. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3007.44s)]
*  Realistic and still safe. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3010.56s)]
*  That's your whole job. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3011.68s)]
*  Got it. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3012.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3013.12s)]
*  So, but if that was one of your man's, you could hire him and be like, yo, watch me work. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3013.7599999999998s)]
*  How do we know that that person's a professional and it's not like Joey Tuba from New Jersey [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3021.7599999999998s)]
*  who's like, yo, make this shit intimate today. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3027.52s)]
*  Like, do we have a track record? [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3031.44s)]
*  So he says to Blake in text, there's an interviewee coordinator I love, [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3032.7999999999997s)]
*  would love for you to meet her and get your sign up before we move forward. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3037.44s)]
*  Got it. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3039.7599999999998s)]
*  She says, no, I'm good. We don't need to meet with this person. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3040.4s)]
*  Now she says specifically, I'll meet with them once we start filming. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3042.96s)]
*  But she declines it in pre-production. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3046.56s)]
*  Got it. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3048.56s)]
*  And so some people look at this and say, oh, she's... [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3049.04s)]
*  Again, that's lazy. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3050.96s)]
*  She declined to... she's also working on other stuff. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3051.84s)]
*  People say, oh... [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3054.1600000000003s)]
*  This is a mom, she's got four kids, she just had a kid. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3054.64s)]
*  Like, she don't have time to meet up with this intimacy coordinator. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3056.7200000000003s)]
*  Also, she's not assuming anything crazy is going to happen. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3059.2000000000003s)]
*  So people are saying she's denying the interviewee coordinator. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3061.92s)]
*  She's a white woman. She's always assuming something crazy. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3063.6s)]
*  Constantly searching for something crazy. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3066.64s)]
*  And you're the lead of this. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3068.24s)]
*  Like, you gotta be all in. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3069.3599999999997s)]
*  Then other people say, no, she didn't decline the intimacy coordinator. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3071.52s)]
*  She just postponed it for the scenes that required like, you know, full-on intimacy, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3074.3999999999996s)]
*  birth, etc. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3079.6s)]
*  Yep. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3080.4799999999996s)]
*  So that's like the big note that everyone's pointing at. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3081.12s)]
*  She declines it. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3083.8399999999997s)]
*  And then slowly addendums and changes to the script start to happen. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3084.64s)]
*  So April 9th, 2023, she starts having notes on the rooftop scene. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3088.24s)]
*  This is like an infamous scene where the two of them meet for the first time. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3092.72s)]
*  And she wants to kind of like change the script a little bit. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3095.68s)]
*  She wants to like revise it. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3097.92s)]
*  She does her version of the scene. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3099.44s)]
*  It kind of changes up a bunch of stuff. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3100.7200000000003s)]
*  Sends it to Baldoni and says, hey, I revised it. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3102.4s)]
*  Before she sends it, she also makes a statement where she goes, [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3105.36s)]
*  a lot of times on these movies, I will rewrite whole scenes. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3108.2400000000002s)]
*  I will add stuff to the movie that gets added in and I never get any credit. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3111.04s)]
*  And sometimes I add stuff and people don't even want to hear it. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3114.88s)]
*  Like, I'm intimately involved in the production and no one gives me the time of day. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3117.36s)]
*  And that's really frustrating as like an actor and all the stuff that I've done this for in Hollywood. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3120.48s)]
*  You maybe didn't mention. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3125.6800000000003s)]
*  She's also a producer. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3127.04s)]
*  Yeah, and he's a director. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3128.72s)]
*  I think that's later. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3129.7599999999998s)]
*  No, I think from the beginning, she's a producer. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3130.56s)]
*  Yeah, I imagine if someone of her size that's stepping into a role in more independent film. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3132.32s)]
*  So it's not just an actress wanting to change a scene. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3137.6s)]
*  It's also someone with power. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3139.7599999999998s)]
*  Now Dove, what are the rules in Hollywood about that? [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3141.36s)]
*  Is there like producer name only or is there? [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3144.24s)]
*  No, I mean, if you're a producer, you have the rights to communicate with. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3148.0s)]
*  She's powerful enough that she can speak up. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3151.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, we got some producers on my special did have no right to do anything. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3153.12s)]
*  Yeah, but we just kind of put them in there. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3157.84s)]
*  But you're a little different than Baldoni, turns out. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3159.84s)]
*  Hopefully, and again, the right way. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3164.48s)]
*  No, but Baldoni is very accommodating. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3165.92s)]
*  And I'm confirming it can be a million EPs. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3168.32s)]
*  But as a producer producer, the ones that would actually win an Academy Award if it [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3171.2s)]
*  got to that point, I think a four or five maybe she's a proper producer on this one. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3174.56s)]
*  OK, so he's like, yeah, you can send me over your. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3179.12s)]
*  By the way, when I was talking about producers on the special, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3182.4s)]
*  I'm just talking about Scooter Braun. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3184.72s)]
*  OK, that's the only one I'm talking about. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3187.84s)]
*  Everybody else did a lot of work for it. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3189.84s)]
*  And thank you very much, Scooter. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3191.52s)]
*  That's for you. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3193.36s)]
*  OK, I didn't go to the NOVA exhibit. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3194.0s)]
*  So Scooter, you get to be a producer on the special. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3195.68s)]
*  All fair. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3198.72s)]
*  Yeah, my bad on that one. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3200.08s)]
*  My bad on that one. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3200.96s)]
*  But she makes changes and sends it over to him. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3201.7599999999998s)]
*  And then he basically responds this. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3204.72s)]
*  And I also think it's worth noting that it seems like Baldoni is potentially [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3206.32s)]
*  on the spectrum a little that he says stuff and does things that are so well intentioned, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3210.16s)]
*  but that come off weird. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3215.76s)]
*  OK, and so he basically says, hey, I really appreciate your passion on this. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3217.76s)]
*  This is awesome. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3221.6800000000003s)]
*  I think realistically, the final version of this will probably be like a blend [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3222.4s)]
*  between like the original version and your version. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3225.28s)]
*  That's someone on the spectrum. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3228.6400000000003s)]
*  You think that Al would work at anything like that? [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3230.2400000000002s)]
*  So the way that I put it in chat, GBT, that doesn't seem like spectrum at all. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3231.84s)]
*  That seems like high emotional intelligence. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3236.32s)]
*  The way she interprets it. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3237.84s)]
*  How do you pronounce the other AI? [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3239.76s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3241.2000000000003s)]
*  How do you pronounce it? [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3241.84s)]
*  I'm talking right now. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3242.4s)]
*  I'm talking right now. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3243.44s)]
*  A white man is talking. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3244.64s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3245.92s)]
*  I told him the P out. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3247.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3248.48s)]
*  I needed that. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3249.68s)]
*  Go, go, go. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3250.2400000000002s)]
*  But so what did we call it? [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3251.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3253.6s)]
*  I just want to hear him say it. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3254.08s)]
*  What's the other chat, GBT, for like history and stuff? [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3255.44s)]
*  I don't even know. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3258.8s)]
*  Perplexity? [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3259.52s)]
*  I don't know this one. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3260.8s)]
*  I swear to God, I don't know this one. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3261.68s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3263.84s)]
*  My bad. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3264.2400000000002s)]
*  So I'll use the one you could say. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3264.96s)]
*  She interprets it as him going, [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3267.44s)]
*  Blake, hey, we're not going to use this, but I love your passion. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3269.52s)]
*  I love that you're still like into this, but we're not going to really use this. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3272.72s)]
*  That's the way she interprets it. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3275.68s)]
*  Oh, see? [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3276.8799999999997s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3278.16s)]
*  So she's pissed off. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3278.64s)]
*  See, I didn't sense that. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3279.7599999999998s)]
*  They do that, right? [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3280.8799999999997s)]
*  They do that, right? [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3283.12s)]
*  Don't they do that? [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3284.48s)]
*  Like he said one thing and she heard something. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3285.52s)]
*  She heard a totally different thing. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3287.6s)]
*  She managed to find a way to make it negative. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3288.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3290.16s)]
*  Asshole-ish. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3290.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3291.52s)]
*  Even when you have your best intentions and you try to accommodate their feelings. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3291.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3294.9599999999996s)]
*  What about that spectrum do you honestly? [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3295.68s)]
*  Well, there's a couple of other things that come up a little bit later that are like. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3297.3599999999997s)]
*  Did he know the exact train times for arrivals? [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3299.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3303.12s)]
*  All right, guys, you've seen the colors of change in the room. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3304.64s)]
*  You already know what time it is. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3306.8799999999997s)]

*  Let's take a break for a second because I got to talk to you about Odoo. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3367.6800000000003s)]
*  Odoo is an all-in-one platform that combines practically every single tool [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3370.8s)]
*  that you could pay for as a business owner under one roof. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3374.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3378.32s)]
*  You can save hundreds, maybe even thousands of dollars by making a switch to Odoo. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3378.5600000000004s)]
*  Let me make this very simple. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3382.1600000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3383.2000000000003s)]
*  They have a time tracking platform so employees can track their hours worked [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3383.6800000000003s)]
*  and an accounting platform to replace QuickBooks, invoicing, and much more. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3386.96s)]
*  Plantstar is low as $24.90. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3390.8s)]
*  Basically, the idea behind this is you're going to use all these different platforms. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3393.04s)]
*  But with Odoo, you don't have to go a la carte. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3396.48s)]
*  It's all under one roof. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3399.1200000000003s)]
*  I mean, even DocuSign, if you think about it, is $25 a month, right? [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3400.6400000000003s)]
*  But we use Odoo's signature platform for the same exact price while having access [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3403.76s)]
*  to every other business tool. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3409.04s)]
*  Makes a lot of sense. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3410.8s)]
*  You should do it, obviously. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3411.92s)]
*  And this is free. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3413.6000000000004s)]
*  Your first app on Odoo is free for life with unlimited hosting and support [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3415.2000000000003s)]
*  and a free personalized domain name for an entire year. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3419.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3422.96s)]
*  So if this sounds useful to you, go to Odoo. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3423.2s)]
*  That is odoo.com slash flagrant to get started with Odoo for free. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3425.6s)]
*  Now let's get back to the show. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3430.16s)]
*  After that, she invites Baldoni to meet at her apartment in New York City. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3431.2799999999997s)]
*  She invites, okay, yeah. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3435.36s)]
*  And they're meeting at her apartment all the time to like work on the script [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3436.24s)]
*  and the hash out scenes and do like regular production stuff. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3438.56s)]
*  Got it. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3441.04s)]
*  So when- [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3441.7599999999998s)]
*  Let's stop there. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3443.04s)]

*  That's a good one. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3500.2400000000002s)]
*  He's skinny now. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3500.6400000000003s)]
*  I said you're skinny now. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3501.28s)]
*  You're never that fat. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3502.5600000000004s)]
*  He was saying- [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3503.52s)]
*  Nah, nah, see now you're going too far. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3504.4s)]
*  You can't take the compliment of being skinny [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3508.48s)]
*  if you were never fat. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3510.64s)]
*  Never. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3511.52s)]
*  It's normal. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3511.84s)]
*  It was normal. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3512.48s)]
*  But you know like when fat people get skinny, [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3512.96s)]
*  you kind of got like post fat body? [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3515.44s)]
*  Bro, when we were in Turkey, [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3518.96s)]
*  he couldn't buckle the life vest. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3519.92s)]
*  He put on the life vest and it wouldn't buckle. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3522.32s)]
*  He said, yo, yo, can you loosen it from the back? [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3524.48s)]
*  Like he said, why say, yo, can you loosen it from the back? [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3526.2400000000002s)]
*  I was like, no, you're going to drown. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3529.04s)]
*  You're fat. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3530.2400000000002s)]
*  That's what's going to happen. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3530.88s)]
*  Why do you need a life vest? [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3531.76s)]
*  Yeah, you float. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3532.8s)]
*  That's not a bomb. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3534.24s)]
*  So basically, Baldoni shows up to the residence of Blake Lively [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3535.7599999999998s)]
*  and greeted at the door is Ryan Reynolds. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3539.7599999999998s)]
*  He's very excited to see him. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3542.56s)]
*  He's like, dude, we're so excited to work on this movie. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3543.68s)]
*  Blake's been super obsessed with the script. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3545.6s)]
*  We're just going to be great. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3547.12s)]
*  They sit down and they go through the script. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3548.4s)]
*  And then at that same meeting, [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3552.32s)]
*  all of a sudden a quote mega celebrity walks in [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3554.24s)]
*  and is also talking about the rooftop scene [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3557.44s)]
*  that Blake had adjusted. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3559.28s)]
*  And she's like, oh my goodness, [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3560.16s)]
*  we love Blake's version of the rooftop scene. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3561.04s)]
*  Everyone loves the way Blake did the rooftop. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3563.12s)]
*  Oh, so putting a little pressure on Baldoni. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3564.88s)]
*  Now this mega superstar is not strictly named. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3567.52s)]
*  I have noticed that in the timeline of events [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3570.16s)]
*  from Baldoni's website, [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3572.4s)]
*  there is actually an uncensored version. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3573.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't know if it's on purpose or on accident [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3575.2s)]
*  where they do say Taylor, [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3576.64s)]
*  which we can presume is Taylor Swift, [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3578.24s)]
*  who is the godparent to Blake Lively's children. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3579.68s)]
*  Son, we got to send Mark's wife away more often. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3582.24s)]
*  There's not a detail that he is breaking his down. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3585.44s)]
*  It's absolutely sensational. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3588.48s)]
*  If anyone can diagnose autism, it's me. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3590.56s)]
*  He had a lot of reading while he was edging. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3593.7599999999998s)]
*  That's what I was edging to. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3596.3199999999997s)]
*  You pop a couple zins, you're locked in. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3597.2799999999997s)]
*  And so basically there's a little bit of pressure [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3599.92s)]
*  being applied to Baldoni, it seems like. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3601.8399999999997s)]
*  Everyone loves Blake's version of it. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3603.2799999999997s)]
*  And this is actually important to note [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3607.2s)]
*  because later Blake will admit that [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3608.48s)]
*  it was actually not her that rewrote the rooftop scene, [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3610.88s)]
*  that it was Ryan Reynolds that rewrote the rooftop scene. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3612.88s)]
*  Oof. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3615.2799999999997s)]
*  To which Sony and the screenwriters are like, [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3615.7599999999998s)]
*  well, we have to give Reynolds a credit on this. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3618.24s)]
*  We're violating our SAG union obligations [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3619.8399999999997s)]
*  like a huge nightmare, you can't say that. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3623.2s)]
*  But she goes on and says anyway, [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3625.2s)]
*  but regardless in the moment she says, I rewrote it. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3626.48s)]
*  He leaves and is basically like, okay, this is kind of wild. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3629.28s)]
*  That was on the 12th, all right. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3632.64s)]
*  And then- [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3634.48s)]
*  One second, isn't that so manipulative? [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3634.96s)]
*  She goes to the guys like, oh, no one ever takes me seriously [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3636.88s)]
*  when I offer suggestions. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3640.4s)]
*  You're using that by saying, I rewrote the scene. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3643.04s)]
*  Meanwhile, it's your husband who rewrote the scene. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3646.32s)]
*  Ooh. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3647.92s)]
*  That's fucked up. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3648.64s)]
*  Great point. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3649.92s)]
*  So now she's playing into his identity of I support women, [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3650.48s)]
*  I believe women, and we need to be better and not playing- [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3654.96s)]
*  And you're playing victim with no one ever takes me seriously. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3657.28s)]
*  I work so hard, I'm such a creative person, [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3660.2400000000002s)]
*  you didn't even do nothing. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3662.7200000000003s)]
*  You didn't read the book, you didn't rewrite the scene. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3663.6s)]
*  What the fuck did you do? [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3665.44s)]
*  It's a good tactic though. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3666.56s)]
*  You know that this guy doesn't want to tell a woman [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3667.92s)]
*  that's the producer of the movie and the lead [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3670.2400000000002s)]
*  that she can't have a say in it [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3672.2400000000002s)]
*  because it goes against his identity publicly. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3673.44s)]
*  So you can manipulate him based on that. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3676.08s)]
*  It's a good idea. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3678.0s)]
*  That man, it's not a nice thing to do. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3679.52s)]
*  No, I'm not saying it's nice, [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3681.04s)]
*  but I can understand why she would go that way with it. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3682.24s)]
*  Gotcha. Okay. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3685.44s)]
*  Right? Because it'd be way harder if she was like, [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3686.48s)]
*  I'm the producer and this is what I'm going to put. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3688.56s)]
*  He'd be like, no, I don't really want to do that. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3690.08s)]
*  But if she goes, I'm a woman and I've been in this business forever [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3692.48s)]
*  and nobody ever takes me seriously and yada yada yada. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3695.04s)]
*  Now he has to be like, well, fuck. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3697.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3698.88s)]
*  I got to say no kindly. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3699.52s)]
*  I got to say it's going to be a blend. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3701.2799999999997s)]
*  Blend, yeah, yeah. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3702.48s)]
*  And I'm pretty sure it is at this point [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3703.52s)]
*  that he basically says something to the effect of like, [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3705.6s)]
*  hey, I loved your revision, [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3708.08s)]
*  even without the cosign of Taylor and Ryan. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3709.36s)]
*  Like you didn't even need to really bring them in. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3711.52s)]
*  Like your work stands on its own and I thought it was great. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3712.88s)]
*  And then she, I believe at this point [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3715.7599999999998s)]
*  is when she sends the Khaleesi text that has now become famous [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3717.7599999999998s)]
*  where she basically says, [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3721.92s)]
*  if you ever get around to watching Game of Thrones, [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3722.7999999999997s)]
*  you'll appreciate that I'm Khaleesi. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3724.48s)]
*  And like her, I happen to have a few dragons, [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3726.48s)]
*  for better or for worse, but usually for better, [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3728.56s)]
*  because my dragons also protect those that I fight for. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3730.72s)]
*  So really we all benefit from those gorgeous monsters of mine. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3733.6s)]
*  You will too. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3736.24s)]
*  I can promise you. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3736.96s)]
*  And I think she's talking about Taylor and Ryan Reynolds [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3738.0s)]
*  as her dragons. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3740.8s)]
*  Now the irony in this is that Khaleesi was pretty famous [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3741.68s)]
*  for like fucking the closest guy to her [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3744.08s)]
*  throughout the Game of Thrones. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3745.76s)]
*  Totally. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3746.7200000000003s)]
*  So I don't know if you really want to say it. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3747.92s)]
*  And dies at the end. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3749.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3750.16s)]
*  Because she loses her mind. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3751.36s)]
*  Horrible metaphor. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3752.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3752.88s)]
*  Okay. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3753.68s)]
*  And then I believe it's also around this point [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3754.16s)]
*  that he leaves her a voice note [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3756.08s)]
*  after she's sort of like expressing like, [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3757.92s)]
*  yeah, I didn't really like the way you responded [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3759.6s)]
*  to my original sort of addendum to the script. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3761.36s)]
*  You kind of brushed me off. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3764.0s)]
*  Baldoni feels bad about it. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3765.44s)]
*  They have this whole intervention, [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3767.28s)]
*  kind of it's like Taylor and everyone. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3768.56s)]
*  And this is when I believe he leaves this voice note [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3769.92s)]
*  that has now become released to the public. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3772.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh yeah, I heard that. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3775.92s)]
*  This is a whole seven minute thing. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3776.56s)]
*  And just to give you a vibe, [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3777.6800000000003s)]
*  people also point to this to indicate how creepy Baldoni is [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3778.6400000000003s)]
*  and that he's sort of like manipulating her. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3782.08s)]
*  Da da da da. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3783.44s)]
*  Nah, nah, the first few, go, just do the first few seconds. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3784.08s)]
*  I think it is two in the morning. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3786.88s)]
*  Pause. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3790.6400000000003s)]
*  Yo, take that sexy voice off, bro. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3791.1200000000003s)]
*  Guilty. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3793.28s)]
*  Yep. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3793.92s)]
*  Yep. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3795.44s)]
*  Don't start no fucking voice note to my wife [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3796.08s)]
*  with it's two in the morning. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3798.4s)]
*  And then the deep, deep, stop, stop. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3799.52s)]
*  Nah, that's creepy. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3802.96s)]
*  Wake you up. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3804.7200000000003s)]
*  Pause. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3808.0s)]
*  Again, why are you breathing loud? [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3809.6s)]
*  He just finished mowing right now, sir. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3811.2000000000003s)]
*  And molding into the god damn voice note. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3812.4s)]
*  Just get the information out. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3814.16s)]
*  All right? [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3816.2400000000002s)]
*  Ryan beating off to this voice memo. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3817.76s)]
*  I just want to say to you, and I hope that we can [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3819.6s)]
*  have a little bit of a chat and FaceTime [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3821.2s)]
*  or see each other in person soon and get to talk more. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3824.3199999999997s)]
*  But I'm just going to send you a few thoughts. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3829.4399999999996s)]
*  And hopefully it's not going to be more than a few minutes. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3831.04s)]
*  But that I don't have the best track record. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3834.08s)]
*  I'm not a Miniman. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3838.16s)]
*  I'm not a Miniman. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3839.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh, no. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3840.08s)]

*  Yeah, he's got girl brain, bro. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3846.24s)]

*  I want to start with an apology. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3851.76s)]
*  Man, I reading the second part of your message, my heart sank. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3855.68s)]

*  I just want to say thank you for sharing that with me. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3879.2s)]
*  He goes on to say, hey, I'm not a perfect person. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3883.04s)]
*  I'm going to do better going forward. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3885.2799999999997s)]

*  Don't leave my wife a voice. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3895.2s)]
*  No, something like that, bro. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3896.64s)]
*  If I'm his wife, I'm tight. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3898.08s)]
*  Why are you sending other bitches voice messages at 2 in the morning? [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3899.68s)]
*  Yeah, have we spoken to his wife yet? [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3902.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3905.04s)]
*  She came out and supported her. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3906.0s)]
*  She's come out in support of him. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3907.52s)]
*  But she hasn't really been vocal in the whole saga. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3909.04s)]
*  But she has obviously just come out in support of him. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3912.08s)]
*  She's a keeper. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3913.68s)]
*  That's kind of where things are at right now. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3916.32s)]
*  So he records this voicemail. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3917.84s)]
*  When does he start recording all the text and everything like that? [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3919.12s)]
*  Because that's a little bit fishy to me. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3921.2s)]
*  The first person that decides to record everything. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3924.0s)]
*  So I think it comes up later that they're actually taking like metadata recordings [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3926.72s)]
*  where they're downloading all the like PDFs and everything. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3930.08s)]
*  But I think they have all the text correspondence from their entire collaboration. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3932.8s)]
*  According to Candice Owens, at some point early in the filming, [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3935.2s)]
*  when Blake Lively starts kicking up a fuss that someone on Justin Baldoni's PR team, [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3938.16s)]
*  there's also like a PR thing that happens where like his original PR lady is like, [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3942.8799999999997s)]
*  are we going to get into that too? [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3947.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's like all crazy. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3948.16s)]
*  But at some point they say, hey, this movie's filming in New Jersey. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3949.7599999999998s)]
*  Y'all are all in New Jersey. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3952.64s)]
*  You don't need her consent to record anything. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3954.0s)]
*  Just record all of it. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3956.0s)]
*  Keep track records of everything. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3957.2s)]
*  They didn't go to New Jersey to do it or whatever. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3958.7999999999997s)]
*  The movie's filming there. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3960.48s)]
*  So it's like, because they were there, they could do this. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3961.3599999999997s)]
*  Just be safe. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3964.16s)]
*  Got it. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3965.2s)]
*  Okay, so something happened and I want to know what that point was where he felt that Blake [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3965.6s)]
*  and maybe Ryan did not have his best interests at heart. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3971.2799999999997s)]
*  And he's like, I need to start collecting information that is potentially [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3974.48s)]
*  protective for me and incriminating to them. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3978.64s)]
*  You know, and I think it was probably the day after this. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3981.4399999999996s)]
*  I think he sends that voice note. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3984.08s)]
*  I think he's probably talking to the director. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3985.52s)]
*  Didn't they try to buy the script for him? [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3987.12s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's coming around. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3988.64s)]
*  That's what I thought. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3989.8399999999997s)]
*  Oh, that's later? [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3990.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3991.52s)]
*  Basically, the voice note comes out and again, we're fast forwarding, but people are using [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3992.08s)]
*  this. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3996.4s)]
*  This basically acts as like a mirage or like an optical illusion. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=3996.64s)]
*  Like if you think that this guy is a creep and a sexual harasser, then you hear it. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4000.3199999999997s)]
*  You're like, obviously, if you assume he's just like a good, well-intentioned, [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4004.88s)]
*  like male feminist type dude, and you're like, yeah, he's being so nice. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4008.0s)]
*  Everything he's saying is good. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4010.96s)]
*  But the way he's saying it. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4012.4s)]
*  The voice is creepy, but the words are the right one. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4014.24s)]
*  And everything he says, he's like, dude, I completely understand. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4016.16s)]
*  Creepy? [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4017.52s)]
*  More like dreamy. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4018.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4019.2799999999997s)]
*  Don't fuck. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4019.84s)]
*  You know what he's saying? [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4021.28s)]
*  I don't believe it. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4022.1600000000003s)]
*  Don't yuck my um. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4023.28s)]
*  I've heard the rhetoric so much from people that I think are full of shit. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4024.32s)]
*  That was my initial issue with him. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4027.92s)]
*  From what I've heard, he seems more sincere, but he does talk like that, which is like, [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4029.36s)]
*  I think an actor way of talking. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4033.6800000000003s)]
*  There's an LA thing throughout all the texts. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4035.6800000000003s)]
*  If you read all the correspondence, the way that all of them talk to each other is sort [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4037.44s)]
*  of insufferable. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4041.52s)]
*  Actors are insufferable people and they think all their words carry such a weight and they [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4042.5600000000004s)]
*  talk as if everything is a Shakespearean novel. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4046.6400000000003s)]
*  I would give the earth to work with you again and the moon and the stars. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4049.36s)]
*  We are destined to make this project. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4053.1200000000003s)]
*  There's no disagreements, by the way, when you're just sitting on set. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4053.84s)]
*  Everybody's just talking about the thing, complaining about the same thing, and agreeing, [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4056.88s)]
*  and then moving on. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4060.6400000000003s)]
*  All being fake nice. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4061.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4062.32s)]
*  It is the most boring. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4063.28s)]
*  That sounds hard. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4064.56s)]
*  Oh, it's awful. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4064.6400000000003s)]
*  It is. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4065.2000000000003s)]
*  It's like the antithesis of a podcast where we just sit here and disagree with each other. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4065.84s)]
*  But the difference is that we actually like each other and then we argue in front of people, [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4070.56s)]
*  whereas these people don't really like each other and they're all so nice. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4073.6s)]
*  Nice. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4076.2400000000002s)]
*  100%. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4077.36s)]
*  So the next phase that happens escalates things crazy. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4078.0s)]
*  So that happened on April 14th, 2023. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4081.68s)]
*  April 22nd, like a week later, Baldoni goes in the movie, in the script, in the original script, [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4085.44s)]
*  there's a scene where his character lifts up her character, picks her up, and Baldoni has a bad [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4091.04s)]
*  back. He's had many back surgeries. He has a bulging disc in his back. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4097.36s)]
*  He got that Luigi. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4102.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's just been blowing out, he's got his back blown up. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4103.12s)]
*  It's like a whole thing, right? [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4106.64s)]
*  So he goes to the personal trainer. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4108.0s)]
*  He's got his back blown up? [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4108.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4111.12s)]
*  What did you mean by that? [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4111.2s)]
*  I don't know if actually he's got his back blown up. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4112.0s)]
*  Because you've been saying the facts for the last 20 minutes perfectly, [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4113.44s)]
*  and then you just said something like, got a bad back, Baldoni. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4116.4s)]
*  So what did you mean when you said that? [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4119.2s)]
*  No, I meant he was blowing out backs. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4120.64s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4122.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4122.8s)]
*  You get a bad back from putting too much work in. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4123.68s)]
*  Putting too much work in. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4125.68s)]
*  Putting too much work in. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4126.48s)]
*  Which is, that's a red flag. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4127.04s)]
*  Never been this bad. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4128.32s)]
*  That is true. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4128.96s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4129.28s)]
*  You have such a good back. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4130.16s)]
*  Yeah, the only good part of me. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4131.28s)]
*  Okay, all right. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4134.16s)]
*  And basically he goes to the personal trainer and says something to the effect of, [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4135.12s)]
*  hey, I want to avoid injury. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4139.44s)]
*  So how much would you estimate Blake Lively weighs? [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4141.92s)]
*  Ballpark. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4147.759999999999s)]
*  Just as a fruit, as a collection of fruits, if you had to guess, [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4149.2s)]
*  it's like 10 watermelons. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4152.4s)]
*  What are we talking, right? [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4153.44s)]
*  He goes to the guy and says, how much does she weigh? [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4154.719999999999s)]
*  And it's not really stated what the personal trainer responds with, [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4156.88s)]
*  but basically this comment gets back to Blake Lively. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4160.4s)]
*  And she's pissed and offended and thinks it's completely inappropriate to be asking about [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4163.759999999999s)]
*  the actress's weight as the director or as an actor, which again, he's playing both. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4169.92s)]
*  If you got to ask, you can't lift her. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4175.599999999999s)]
*  Right? [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4178.32s)]
*  He doesn't want to be embarrassed. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4179.2s)]
*  What if she, you know. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4180.24s)]
*  No, I'm just saying, if you have to ask, it's because you're concerned. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4181.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4184.88s)]
*  And if then you got to change it, you got to rewrite it. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4185.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4188.4s)]
*  So that becomes a problem, okay? [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4189.28s)]
*  And that happens on April 22nd. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4192.08s)]
*  Now, how much do you think she weighs? [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4195.04s)]
*  Because she's not small, right? [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4198.0s)]
*  Like she was a model at one point. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4199.28s)]
*  Tall lady. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4200.72s)]
*  She looked tall. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4201.28s)]
*  How tall is she? [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4202.0s)]
*  I don't know how tall she is. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4203.12s)]
*  Five, nine, five, ten, probably. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4204.64s)]
*  So she's probably around like a buck fifty. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4206.24s)]
*  Tall as Albert tends to be. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4207.92s)]
*  So she's what? [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4209.92s)]
*  Like a buck fifty. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4210.5599999999995s)]
*  So he's got a deadlift of buck fifty with a bad back. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4211.5199999999995s)]
*  Damn. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4216.08s)]
*  Is that? [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4219.04s)]
*  How you put 150 on her? [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4219.6s)]
*  Is that a lot? [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4221.68s)]
*  She's five, ten. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4223.04s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like that's a good amount of shit. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4224.32s)]
*  Yeah, but they don't eat. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4226.8s)]
*  She's probably like 120. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4228.0s)]
*  No chance she's five, ten. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4230.24s)]
*  120 at five, ten. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4231.599999999999s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4232.8s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4233.36s)]
*  No? [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4234.0s)]
*  I don't know bitches. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4235.12s)]
*  So again, this is like some spectrum thing where it's like, okay, you're asking, [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4235.92s)]
*  you want to do the right thing, you have a bad back, [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4239.04s)]
*  you want to make sure you can do the scene properly. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4240.72s)]
*  And also you don't want to make her feel bad if he goes to lift her. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4242.08s)]
*  And then his back is fucked up and he's like, oh, it's not you, it's me. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4244.64s)]
*  He's really treating her as an equal and she's like, treat me as a woman. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4247.36s)]
*  Treat me as a woman in Hollywood. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4252.5599999999995s)]
*  Don't treat me as an actor. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4254.639999999999s)]
*  Treat me as a woman who is concerned about my weight because I just had a baby. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4255.679999999999s)]
*  I put on some weight. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4259.2s)]
*  I'm working out every single day. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4259.92s)]
*  Now you're going to my trainer like, yo, she got the weight down yet? [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4261.28s)]
*  Because I got to lift this fucking chick. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4263.679999999999s)]
*  And you're concerned. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4265.36s)]
*  I think you got to just lift her or put her on an Apple box. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4267.36s)]
*  What do they do with Tom Holland? [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4269.759999999999s)]
*  Whatever they do with Tom Holland, just do that with... [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4272.24s)]
*  Back brace or something. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4274.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4275.28s)]
*  There's got to be a way. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4275.44s)]
*  What do they do to make the cameras not move? [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4276.48s)]
*  Gimble. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4279.36s)]
*  Gimble. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4280.0s)]
*  What if you did that? [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4282.48s)]
*  What if you just attached her? [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4283.28s)]
*  A harness? [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4286.4s)]
*  You could do like wicked and make her fly to fly gravity and there's got to be a way. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4287.759999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4291.5199999999995s)]
*  Apparently, I think they ended up working and rehearsing with a body double [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4292.799999999999s)]
*  while they're trying to get the scene worked out. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4296.32s)]
*  And then three days later, according again, this is to Baldoni's [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4298.5599999999995s)]
*  sort of online testimony of like evidence he's putting out, [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4302.64s)]
*  that he summoned to Lively's penthouse in New York where he's greeted by Reynolds, [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4305.68s)]
*  who swore at Baldoni accused him of fat shaming. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4309.28s)]
*  Quote, how dare you fucking ask about my wife's weight? [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4311.68s)]
*  What is wrong with you? [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4314.64s)]
*  The tone from Reynolds and Lively was so aggressive that Baldoni felt he had no choice, [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4315.76s)]
*  but again, to offer repeated apologies for what was a good faith reasonable question [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4318.96s)]
*  to the trainer, not Lively, and demanded that Baldoni... [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4324.88s)]
*  Reynolds demanded that they remove the lift scene completely. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4328.32s)]
*  Now, later, Lively claims that the lift scene was never in the movie. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4331.76s)]
*  It's not in the movie currently. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4335.360000000001s)]
*  I'm pretty sure it's in the book, so it'd be in the movie. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4336.56s)]
*  But they said that it was never even in the script. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4339.12s)]
*  There is versions of the script that have it in there. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4341.2s)]
*  They say it was removed in the edit. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4343.2s)]
*  Again, yada, yada, yada. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4344.88s)]
*  So that is, I think, where things really kind of start to turn. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4346.56s)]
*  And I think that is when they started recording everything after this argument. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4350.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4355.12s)]
*  Now he's concerned that they could paint him in a certain way. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4357.52s)]
*  You could use sexism against him. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4360.56s)]
*  And that is his brand. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4362.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm a male feminist. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4365.04s)]
*  I love women. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4365.84s)]
*  And then I'm fat shaming woman on myself. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4367.280000000001s)]
*  And Ryan Reynolds is much more powerful than me. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4369.12s)]
*  Taylor Swift is much more powerful than me. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4370.64s)]
*  And her whole thing is taking down men. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4372.320000000001s)]
*  All she has to tweet out is, this director is super creepy. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4374.320000000001s)]
*  He was like, let him know how much I weighed. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4377.12s)]
*  Now it's worth noting that at this point, [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4379.92s)]
*  Lively had already expressed concern over her body. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4382.320000000001s)]
*  She's already told him, hey, I want to be in shape. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4385.200000000001s)]
*  I really treat this seriously. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4387.360000000001s)]
*  Bitch, you got fat. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4388.8s)]
*  She had a baby. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4391.04s)]
*  She had a baby already. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4391.84s)]
*  Yeah, she should. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4392.96s)]
*  She shouldn't be skinny after having a baby. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4393.76s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4395.12s)]
*  But if I'm a lifter, I need to know what she weighs. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4395.68s)]
*  But she's already expressed, hey, I feel sort of insecure with my figure. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4397.4400000000005s)]
*  And he assures her over and over, don't worry, we're going to make you look amazing. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4400.400000000001s)]
*  Don't even worry about this. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4402.88s)]
*  This should be the last thing in your mind. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4403.68s)]
*  You're a great mom. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4404.72s)]
*  Don't even worry about that. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4405.360000000001s)]
*  I think he says shit like, your body is beautiful or something like that. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4406.0s)]
*  He says, yeah, you're great. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4408.320000000001s)]
*  Don't even worry. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4410.08s)]
*  I don't know if he says specifically beautiful. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4410.56s)]
*  He might have. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4412.08s)]
*  But basically, he's assuring her it's fine. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4413.04s)]
*  And then later is asking about her weight to the personal trainer. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4414.72s)]
*  Some people see that as an infringement in some type of inappropriate. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4417.52s)]
*  How important is this lifting in the air scene? [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4419.92s)]
*  It's not like dirty dancing or anything like that, right? [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4421.68s)]
*  Maybe it had that type of significance. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4424.0s)]
*  Never read the book, I can't say. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4427.04s)]
*  You read the book, Akash? [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4428.400000000001s)]
*  No, but my wife did. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4430.08s)]
*  By osmosis. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4432.0s)]
*  He read the book. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4433.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4433.92s)]
*  And I think it's like the idea of him is like he's very masculine, protective, [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4434.320000000001s)]
*  made her feel protected probably before everything. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4438.320000000001s)]
*  And like that's part of the whole like, this guy's just like this hot, [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4440.16s)]
*  masculine doctor. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4443.92s)]
*  He believes it adds to the story that he's a strong, powerful guy. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4445.04s)]
*  And that's the way that he subverts her in order to abuse her later. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4448.0s)]
*  So he thinks it's integral to the story that shows that he's dominant over her. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4451.2s)]
*  He's able to move her around. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4454.4800000000005s)]
*  Got it. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4455.6s)]
*  So why the train of snitch though? [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4456.4s)]
*  It's a broke over. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4458.96s)]
*  Not even. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4460.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4461.36s)]
*  I mean, yeah, I guess it should be. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4461.84s)]
*  But at the same time, it's like you'll just say anything to curry favor to the people that are paying him. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4463.52s)]
*  Gotcha. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4468.56s)]
*  In this same meeting, Lively tells Baldoni that if he can't get on board with how she works, [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4468.96s)]
*  she has, quote, two weeks to recast her. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4473.6s)]
*  He knows it's impossible to recast her at this point. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4477.120000000001s)]
*  They're already in pre-production. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4478.96s)]
*  Wardrobe's already getting bought. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4480.08s)]
*  And he's like, I'll work with however you want to work. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4481.52s)]
*  You got it. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4483.92s)]
*  Now, this kind of tips the scales, pun intended, [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4484.8s)]
*  towards the side of her gaining more power over the whole production. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4488.56s)]
*  And then the wardrobe thing becomes another big issue. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4492.96s)]
*  So basically, the first day of principal photography, they capture her wardrobe. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4496.88s)]
*  Apparently, she's doing like all of her own wardrobe. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4501.120000000001s)]
*  She's like dressing herself. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4503.12s)]
*  They already spent all this money. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4504.4s)]
*  And there's like a whole issue with the money. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4505.84s)]
*  The money thing is crazy. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4507.5199999999995s)]
*  They have a budget allocated. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4508.88s)]
*  It's like half a million dollars or something like that. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4509.84s)]
*  She's spent like $650,000. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4511.28s)]
*  Again, some people say that's completely normal [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4513.36s)]
*  and that they return stuff and shrink down the budget later. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4515.5199999999995s)]
*  Other people saying that she's being gratuitous with the spending [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4518.4s)]
*  and is not worried about the budget that's getting put up. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4520.32s)]
*  But again, this becomes another point of contention [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4522.8s)]
*  where they're talking to her about the wardrobe stuff. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4525.12s)]
*  Also, when the pictures leak of the wardrobe, everyone hates it. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4526.96s)]
*  All the fans of the book are like, [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4530.320000000001s)]
*  this is not what the girl looks like in the book. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4531.4400000000005s)]
*  She's also wearing like two pairs of pants and shit like that. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4533.76s)]
*  It's like, who the fuck dresses like this? [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4536.08s)]
*  So like this is an actual message that they even put in the group chat [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4537.6s)]
*  to discuss her wardrobe. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4541.280000000001s)]
*  They're like, this is not how she looks. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4542.400000000001s)]
*  And this is from two years ago and all the comments are like, this is atrocious. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4544.72s)]
*  That's $600? [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4548.96s)]
*  That's a thrift shop in fucking Williamsburg right there. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4550.96s)]
*  So that's adding to everything, right? [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4555.280000000001s)]
*  But she didn't read the book, [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4557.52s)]
*  so she doesn't know how the character dresses. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4558.48s)]
*  So this is now getting backlash. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4561.2s)]
*  Sony's talking about it. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4563.28s)]
*  Everyone's like now concerned with the casting and the wardrobe. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4564.32s)]
*  It's like just causing problems on the set. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4567.679999999999s)]
*  And then basically right around this time, there's the writer's strike. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4569.44s)]
*  And so the writer's guild is basically on strike. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4573.679999999999s)]
*  And now there's like picketing going on at all the production days. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4576.16s)]
*  And then on May 29th, right before they stopped filming officially, [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4579.04s)]
*  Wayfair was made aware that Lively had placed calls to Sony to share grievances. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4582.5599999999995s)]
*  So here are a couple of grievances. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4588.0s)]
*  One, Baldoni made a comment about her looking sexy on set [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4589.44s)]
*  in regards to her wardrobe that the character Lively was wearing. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4593.839999999999s)]
*  Apparently, she was also shown pornography is how it was sort of described in the press. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4598.96s)]
*  But then in this complaint to Sony that she was shown a birth video. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4603.919999999999s)]
*  And then lastly, she shared that one of the assistant directors [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4608.719999999999s)]
*  had wanted to replace her, like get her out of there. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4612.08s)]
*  So Baldoni has responses to all of these grievances. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4614.48s)]
*  Do you want to hear those or this is just where it's at right now? [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4617.5199999999995s)]
*  Baldoni says that like the birth video thing was like a non-issue. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4620.08s)]
*  Like there's a birth scene and they asked her like, [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4623.36s)]
*  hey, do you want to see a picture of one of the other producers' home birth? [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4625.839999999999s)]
*  And she was like, oh, let me finish eating. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4628.879999999999s)]
*  And he like had it on his phone but never showed her. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4630.719999999999s)]
*  And it was completely consensual. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4633.12s)]
*  It was not pornography. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4634.719999999999s)]
*  It was just video of birth. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4635.679999999999s)]
*  The sexy comment came because Blake Lively was talking about how she wants the character to be sexy. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4638.08s)]
*  She says it throughout the text. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4642.32s)]
*  She's like, I want the character to be sexy. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4643.36s)]
*  I want the character to be sexy. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4644.5599999999995s)]
*  And then he goes, you look sexy. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4645.5199999999995s)]
*  And then in one of the scenes, she's wearing like a onesie with a coat on. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4646.56s)]
*  And he goes, oh, take the coat off because like it'll make the character like more sexy. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4649.52s)]
*  She interprets that as like, what the fuck is this guy doing? [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4653.76s)]
*  He's like leaving me voicemails. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4656.240000000001s)]
*  He's like, this is like, he's such a creep. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4657.360000000001s)]
*  And now he's telling me I should be sexy. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4659.68s)]
*  And then the directors, the ADs that are asking to replace her, the ADs end up getting removed. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4662.400000000001s)]
*  And Baldoni's like, yeah, they were causing trouble on the set. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4667.6s)]
*  They wanted to recast Lively. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4669.84s)]
*  I said, you guys got to go. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4671.4400000000005s)]
*  And so that's where things stand. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4673.280000000001s)]
*  And then on the 14th, they go on strike. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4675.04s)]
*  And so production stops. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4678.48s)]
*  And then it's in this whole time that again, power starts to shift. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4680.24s)]

*  Now let's get back to this show. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4849.5199999999995s)]
*  And I think it's right around this time that like there's kind of a standoff. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4850.639999999999s)]
*  No one really knows what's gonna happen. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4853.92s)]
*  They resume shooting in January and she comes back with a list of non-negotiables. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4854.799999999999s)]
*  So even more stuff than now she's flagging to everyone. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4859.599999999999s)]
*  Sony, everyone involved and the non-negotiables are everything from the stuff we read before, [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4862.16s)]
*  but like they're more egregious. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4866.24s)]
*  I can go through them one by one. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4867.44s)]
*  But basically, he's basically saying like these are... [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4869.28s)]
*  I'm not coming back to film unless y'all give me these things. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4872.96s)]
*  And so we need an all-hands meeting. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4874.96s)]
*  I need access to the dailies. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4876.56s)]
*  I need access to script revisions. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4878.0s)]
*  I need people to not be walking in my trailer while I'm breastfeeding [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4879.36s)]
*  because you guys walked in and you were trying to see me breastfeeding, [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4882.32s)]
*  which later she says in text like I know you weren't trying to like cop a look, [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4885.12s)]
*  but it made me uncomfortable. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4888.24s)]
*  I think she actually invited him. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4889.2s)]
*  She said I'm breastfeeding. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4890.4s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4891.52s)]
*  He released that text. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4892.72s)]
*  Precisely. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4894.0s)]
*  He releases that to show like it wasn't really a problem that there was one time where multiple people walked in [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4894.72s)]
*  and then they kind of like turned away and it wasn't really an issue. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4899.6s)]
*  Again, he said, she said... [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4902.4s)]
*  What I'm seeing on the internet is a lot of accusations from her and then him delivering, [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4903.68s)]
*  as the internet says, receipts. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4907.76s)]
*  Yes. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4910.08s)]
*  Right? [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4910.64s)]
*  And I think that... [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4911.04s)]
*  And then Candice organized all this stuff brilliantly. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4911.92s)]
*  Shout out Candice Owens, the most feared person on the internet. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4916.16s)]
*  Once again, Candice, if we mention you on this podcast, we want no problems. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4918.64s)]
*  We want no problems. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4923.04s)]
*  I call her Deebo. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4924.0s)]
*  Deebo. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4925.52s)]
*  Tuck in your chain, bro. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4925.92s)]
*  We want no problems with Deebo. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4926.64s)]
*  Tuck in your dickies. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4928.240000000001s)]
*  Candice is coming. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4929.360000000001s)]
*  We want no problems. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4930.320000000001s)]
*  Okay? [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4931.76s)]
*  We think you're doing amazing work with this Justin Baldoni, Blake Lively situation. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4932.48s)]
*  Okay? [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4937.839999999999s)]
*  Maybe this is some great work with what's happening with politics in France. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4938.48s)]
*  Outside of that, we're not speaking on it and we want no problems. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4941.5199999999995s)]
*  Okay? [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4945.44s)]
*  We've got our white Candice right here. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4946.5599999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4948.24s)]
*  And he's gonna go. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4948.639999999999s)]
*  Yes, I'm a man. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4949.5199999999995s)]
*  Jesus is coming. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4950.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4950.719999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4951.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4952.0s)]
*  Tell us what's going on. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4952.24s)]
*  So basically, the shooting resumes in January and... [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4953.2s)]
*  Who's the president of France married to, Mark? [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4955.28s)]
*  Not his dad. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4958.0s)]
*  Okay, just making sure. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4958.799999999999s)]
*  A woman. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4959.839999999999s)]
*  A woman, right? [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4961.04s)]
*  I don't even know how... [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4961.68s)]
*  Candice is on that ass. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4962.88s)]
*  Bro, I know a little bit about it. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4964.400000000001s)]
*  You don't know how wild it got. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4966.16s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4967.52s)]
*  Candice said that not only was Macron's wife a man, [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4968.08s)]
*  she's now alleging that Macron's wife is actually Macron's dad. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4973.6s)]
*  What? [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4978.4800000000005s)]
*  You know? [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4982.64s)]
*  I believe you. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4983.04s)]
*  Some people may. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4983.84s)]
*  Hey, we believe you over here, Candice. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4984.64s)]
*  Just keep that energy open. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4986.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4989.200000000001s)]
*  Talk about that. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4990.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4991.68s)]
*  Everything's bad over there. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4992.32s)]
*  Anyway, go on. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4993.4400000000005s)]
*  So she's got all these demands. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4994.0s)]
*  They kind of capitulate against the advice of some of the other producers. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4995.12s)]
*  They're like, yo, stop giving her all this power. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4998.08s)]
*  And so she's just gaining more and more power. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=4999.6s)]
*  I want addendums to the script, da, da, da, da. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5001.2s)]
*  And... [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5003.2s)]
*  Give me the drama. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5004.4800000000005s)]
*  Give me the gossip. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5005.52s)]
*  Okay. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5006.64s)]
*  Give me the Perez Hilton. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5006.88s)]
*  Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5007.84s)]
*  I got to pull up one more thing. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5009.04s)]
*  So this is when things... [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5010.64s)]
*  Like the hair down. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5011.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5012.08s)]
*  You might get a little... [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5012.56s)]
*  You can get your Baldoni on. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5013.76s)]
*  Oh, and this is where things go a little wild. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5015.2s)]
*  January 4th, Baldoni, another one of the executives from Wayfair, a Sony executive, [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5017.68s)]
*  and an A-list producer that was brought in by Lively and Reynolds meet at her apartment. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5023.84s)]
*  It was January 4th. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5028.72s)]
*  As the team prepared, the production binders on... [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5029.6s)]
*  They have the production binders on hand. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5033.68s)]
*  And basically, Reynolds then starts berating Baldoni, demanding that he apologize to Lively [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5035.4400000000005s)]
*  for the actions that either had never occurred or had been grossly mischaracterized. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5040.08s)]
*  Baldoni resists apologizing for things he had not done, [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5043.92s)]
*  which further enraged Reynolds. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5047.04s)]
*  Again, this comes from Baldoni's testimony here on his website. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5048.32s)]
*  Everyone, including the new producer that Lively had requested to join the production [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5051.68s)]
*  and the Sony executives, they quote that they had never seen anything like this happen in [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5055.04s)]
*  their productions or have never seen an executive or director spoken to in such a manner during a [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5060.72s)]
*  meeting. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5064.8s)]
*  Later, the Sony representatives shared that they often reflected on the meeting and regretted not [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5065.28s)]
*  intervening to stop Reynolds' tirade against Baldoni. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5068.96s)]
*  So, as we see... [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5072.72s)]
*  Now, Reynolds is involved. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5074.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5075.28s)]
*  He's talking that shit. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5075.68s)]
*  Tensions are rising. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5077.04s)]
*  So, everyone's pissed off. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5078.8s)]
*  They somehow complete the filming. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5080.24s)]
*  And then it's basically in the aftermath of the edit that everything just gets fucked. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5082.08s)]
*  So, they're now fighting over the final cut of the film. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5086.72s)]
*  And they're doing pre-promo where they're filming all this stuff before the trailer's [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5090.08s)]
*  announced. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5094.16s)]
*  Baldoni's not involved in any of it. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5094.56s)]
*  So, they hire Reynolds' company to do a lot of the production stuff. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5096.24s)]
*  So, now it's the whole cast. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5099.52s)]
*  It's Blake Lively. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5100.96s)]
*  It's everyone else in the movie. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5102.0s)]
*  It's the book writer, the author. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5103.04s)]
*  And Baldoni's not involved in any of it, which is very strange that the director and the [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5105.2s)]
*  other co-lead is not involved in the film. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5108.48s)]
*  So, the film gets released and then they're basically like, okay, who's going to do the [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5110.96s)]
*  final edit? [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5114.16s)]
*  Baldoni has his version, but then Blake Lively's gained so much power over the production. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5115.44s)]
*  She's like, I want to do an edit. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5119.76s)]
*  And then she slowly creeps in. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5120.8s)]
*  She's like, I just want to sit with you while you edit it. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5122.32s)]
*  And then she goes, actually, I want to work on it alone with my own editor. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5124.5599999999995s)]
*  And the producer's like, don't do it. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5128.32s)]
*  Don't do it. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5129.68s)]
*  Baldoni capitulates. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5130.0s)]
*  He's like, okay, fine. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5130.96s)]
*  You can do your version. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5131.68s)]
*  I'll do my version. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5132.4s)]
*  Let's test both of them. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5133.04s)]
*  And then whichever one gets a higher. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5134.32s)]
*  I think that was Sony's solution. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5135.36s)]
*  Baldoni's does better. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5137.12s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5138.799999999999s)]
*  They go with Blake's. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5139.5199999999995s)]
*  Precisely. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5140.639999999999s)]
*  And Blake will use some like Taylor leverage with a song or something like that. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5141.2s)]
*  She's now saying like, oh, we're going to have Taylor in. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5144.799999999999s)]
*  We're going to have Taylor's song on the thing, but she only wants to be in my edit. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5147.12s)]
*  And it's like a whole back and forth. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5150.24s)]
*  Apparently, she's adding stuff in from Baldoni's edit, but claiming that it's still her edit. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5152.16s)]
*  It's like a fucking- [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5156.08s)]
*  They don't let Baldoni's side see the edit at all. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5156.799999999999s)]
*  It's a shit show. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5159.2s)]
*  So now they do a bunch of press with Adam. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5160.719999999999s)]
*  This comes out. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5162.88s)]
*  The movie's released. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5163.6s)]
*  Crushes. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5164.88s)]
*  Movie Crushes. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5165.68s)]
*  They made it for $25 million. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5166.72s)]
*  They made it for $350 million. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5167.76s)]
*  But people were annoyed before we found out any of this at just like how she was marketing the film. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5169.4400000000005s)]
*  Where they're doing like funny ads. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5175.360000000001s)]
*  They're doing funny ads where like Ryan Reynolds is jealous of her love interest in the movie. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5177.280000000001s)]
*  And like talking about his ass and how nice it is. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5181.84s)]
*  So it's like if you're doing- [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5184.08s)]
*  They're treating it like a rom-com. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5185.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5186.64s)]
*  And it's not a rom-com at all. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5186.96s)]
*  And it's like this is a domestic violence movie and Blake Lively is promoting a haircut line [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5188.08s)]
*  and making a big point to wear like florals and talk about the fashion. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5191.92s)]
*  And Ryan, I mean, Justin Baldoni, it seems, when he talks about the movie, [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5194.96s)]
*  seems to be about abuse like why do men do this? [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5198.64s)]
*  This is what the point of the movie is, etc. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5201.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5203.28s)]
*  I mean, do you think now he has a better understanding of why men be women? [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5203.6s)]
*  Like do you think going through this process, he's just like, I get it actually. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5208.4800000000005s)]
*  I fucking understand. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5215.12s)]
*  I didn't understand it before. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5216.0s)]
*  But now after knowing the Dragon Lady, I see what's up with those hoes. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5217.12s)]
*  We're doing a sequel. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5219.76s)]
*  It's called It Starts With Us. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5220.8s)]
*  It starts with you. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5224.56s)]
*  So this is one of the press things that happen that sets people off. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5226.64s)]
*  And they're like, dude, this is a book about domestic violence. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5230.16s)]
*  Is this how you respond? [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5232.16s)]
*  Let's jump into this and Blake, I'm going to start with you. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5232.88s)]
*  Most of us, if we're lucky enough to run into a celebrity in public, [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5234.64s)]
*  we only have a few moments to maybe speak with you guys. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5237.68s)]
*  But for people who see this movie, who relate to the topics of this movie [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5240.16s)]
*  on a deeply personal level, they're really going to want to talk to you. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5243.68s)]
*  This movie is going to affect people and they're going to want to tell you about their lives. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5246.96s)]
*  So if someone understands the themes of this movie, comes across you in public, [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5250.48s)]
*  and they want to really talk to you, what's the best way for them to talk to you about this? [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5255.04s)]
*  How would you recommend they go about it? [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5259.679999999999s)]
*  Like asking for like my address or my phone number or like my location share. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5260.799999999999s)]
*  Or I could just location share you and then we could. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5265.679999999999s)]
*  Social Security number. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5270.959999999999s)]
*  I'm a Virgo. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5272.639999999999s)]
*  So I'm like, are we talking logistics? [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5273.36s)]
*  Are we talking emotionally? [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5275.12s)]
*  So people point to that and be like, I mean, he asked you a pretty genuine question. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5276.48s)]
*  How should people talk about domestic violence? [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5279.52s)]
*  And then she makes a joke about it ostensibly is how people perceive this. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5281.120000000001s)]
*  Damn. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5284.320000000001s)]
*  They're calling this the J-Lo era? [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5284.88s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5286.64s)]
*  I remember again, my wife was into this. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5287.92s)]
*  She liked the book. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5291.040000000001s)]
*  She was talking about this shit too. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5291.76s)]
*  She's like, it's weird. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5293.120000000001s)]
*  How's it being promoted? [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5294.320000000001s)]
*  She didn't like the movie. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5295.200000000001s)]
*  She walked out being like, we don't need to see it again. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5296.080000000001s)]
*  And my wife will rewatch anything she likes at all. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5298.400000000001s)]
*  She saw Wicked twice. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5300.8s)]
*  Wicked came out. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5301.84s)]
*  I want to watch it a third time. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5302.56s)]
*  This she was like, we're good. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5303.84s)]
*  You don't need to watch it. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5304.96s)]
*  Another short excerpt that adds to the fire. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5305.6s)]
*  So the best is in theaters now. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5307.52s)]
*  So grab your friends, wear your florals, and head out to see it. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5309.280000000001s)]
*  And people are like, why are you talking about grabbing your friends [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5312.88s)]
*  and wearing florals, da da da? [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5314.72s)]
*  This seems inappropriate. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5316.080000000001s)]
*  Now to Blake's defense, she's like, this is supposed to be a movie about triumph, [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5317.280000000001s)]
*  about overcoming domestic violence. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5319.76s)]
*  I don't want us to be painting women as victims again. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5321.4400000000005s)]
*  I also think once you create a narrative, she's got what, 20 years in the business? [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5323.76s)]
*  It's so easy to do that with us. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5328.160000000001s)]
*  We talked two hours a fucking week on a podcast. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5329.120000000001s)]
*  If you want to paint us in one way, you can grab a 30-second clip and make us look bad. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5330.96s)]
*  So I think you can do that with her. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5334.88s)]
*  I don't think they're looking through every interview that she's done [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5336.32s)]
*  to show how seriously she takes film. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5338.639999999999s)]
*  And I just remember before any Baldoni stuff came out, people were like, [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5340.719999999999s)]
*  what does she do? [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5345.28s)]
*  Why is she promoting a hair care line? [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5346.0s)]
*  What's going on? [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5347.84s)]
*  That narrative existed before. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5348.639999999999s)]
*  I just feel like once the internet decides that they don't like somebody, [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5351.12s)]
*  they just search for proof and then execute. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5353.5199999999995s)]
*  Now, she could have, this could be justified. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5355.44s)]
*  She could have been a huge bitch in this production, [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5358.16s)]
*  try to take it with them and use Reynolds power and money [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5360.08s)]
*  and thinking that like Baldoni doesn't have that same support, [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5362.96s)]
*  which it seems like he does from Wayfair or whatever. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5365.68s)]
*  Maybe they thought that they could just take the movie, [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5369.4400000000005s)]
*  get the rights, make 300 million on this one, [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5371.200000000001s)]
*  do the prequel or the sequel, whatever it is, [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5373.360000000001s)]
*  make another 600 million on that one. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5375.4400000000005s)]
*  Now they got the next billion-dollar Twilight franchise. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5376.96s)]
*  Yeah, they probably thought they could do it. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5379.6s)]
*  And maybe she didn't like the guy. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5381.4400000000005s)]
*  So they're like, you know what? [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5382.72s)]
*  Fuck this guy. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5383.84s)]
*  He's kind of a dick. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5384.56s)]
*  I don't care if we destroy his character, [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5386.240000000001s)]
*  if we can get this billion-dollar franchise. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5388.08s)]
*  That's possible. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5389.68s)]
*  And to contribute to it, right around this time, [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5390.4800000000005s)]
*  a different journalist released another interview [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5392.4800000000005s)]
*  where Blake Lively is shown to be a quote, mean girl. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5395.2s)]
*  And this is the one that went super viral. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5398.0s)]
*  Again, this is associated with a different film. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5400.0s)]
*  This is Cafe Society. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5402.48s)]
*  And this woman releases this sort of unannounced, unprovoked. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5404.16s)]
*  She just puts it out there, the Blake Lively interview [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5408.48s)]
*  that made me want to quit interviewing forever. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5410.96s)]
*  That's on your little bump. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5412.4s)]
*  Congrats on your little bump. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5414.72s)]
*  What about my bump? [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5416.96s)]
*  Oh, she's trying to say it. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5419.04s)]
*  You've got two nice ones. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5420.5599999999995s)]
*  And these, they are kind of bumps, aren't they? [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5422.4s)]
*  No, not bumps. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5425.52s)]
*  Who's the girl with her? [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5426.88s)]
*  I don't know her name. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5428.24s)]
*  Dawn Girl. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5428.8s)]
*  I forget her name. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5429.36s)]
*  She's gone though. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5430.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5430.32s)]
*  But I've been that person. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5430.72s)]
*  Yeah, where you just try to be like, oh, this is awkward. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5432.64s)]
*  Like, yeah, somebody says something mean, [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5434.32s)]
*  and you're like, I just need to cover the dead air. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5436.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5438.16s)]
*  Like, that's what that was. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5438.4s)]
*  Yeah, no, 100%. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5440.08s)]
*  And so they kind of salvage it. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5441.4400000000005s)]
*  Then in this film specifically, this is not, obviously, [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5442.72s)]
*  it ends with a she asks about the wardrobe, [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5445.36s)]
*  which is apparently super important to the movie. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5447.04s)]
*  Did you guys love wearing those kind of clothes that you wore? [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5448.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5451.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5452.160000000001s)]
*  And you know, working in digital. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5452.64s)]
*  Everyone wants to talk about the clothes, [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5453.68s)]
*  but I wonder if they would ask the men about the clothes. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5455.12s)]
*  Oh, God. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5457.280000000001s)]
*  I love Jesse's suits and how he... [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5457.84s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5461.6s)]
*  His wardrobe was beautiful. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5462.8s)]
*  Oh, I know. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5464.0s)]
*  Cory's wardrobe. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5464.400000000001s)]
*  Cory's not looking at the girl in the ass. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5464.8s)]
*  Or his those high-waisted pants. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5466.56s)]
*  He's so brown. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5467.84s)]
*  I wish men wore high-waisted pants like that still. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5468.8s)]
*  I know. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5471.12s)]
*  Or the father with his tank top. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5471.84s)]
*  She seems like they had beef before this shit. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5474.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5476.88s)]
*  Something seems off. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5478.16s)]
*  They go on to talk for like two or three minutes. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5479.2s)]
*  Like did Blake have beef with the interviewer? [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5481.679999999999s)]
*  Interviewer, yeah. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5483.599999999999s)]
*  Apparently this is... [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5484.32s)]
*  Not disclosed. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5485.12s)]
*  It's possible. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5485.839999999999s)]
*  I'm saying like did the interviewer review one of her movies five years ago [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5486.32s)]
*  and said she's horrible and she looks like shit? [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5489.5199999999995s)]
*  She's been on the list. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5491.12s)]
*  Now it's like... [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5492.4s)]
*  I think a lot of times you assume that celebrities [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5493.36s)]
*  don't look at what people say about them. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5495.679999999999s)]
*  Oh. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5497.5199999999995s)]
*  They look at all of that shit. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5497.919999999999s)]
*  These messages will prove that they're looking at everything. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5499.04s)]
*  Everything. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5501.28s)]
*  They're posting random girls' TikToks like, [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5501.679999999999s)]
*  did you see what this girl said? [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5503.759999999999s)]
*  Yep. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5504.719999999999s)]
*  She's saying this about this. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5505.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5506.08s)]
*  Like some girl with like a thousand likes on a TikTok. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5506.48s)]
*  Do you remember the first celeb that responded to you on Twitter [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5508.799999999999s)]
*  when Twitter first came out? [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5511.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5513.04s)]
*  Who was it? [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5513.599999999999s)]
*  Pusha T. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5514.08s)]
*  Pusha T. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5514.719999999999s)]
*  Do you remember? [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5515.28s)]
*  I wasn't on Twitter early. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5516.0s)]
*  Like I got that like... [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5517.679999999999s)]
*  Michael K. Williams from The Wire. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5518.639999999999s)]
*  Fuck, what's his name? [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5523.2s)]
*  Omar. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5525.04s)]
*  Omar. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5525.5199999999995s)]
*  Omar. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5525.919999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5526.32s)]
*  In that moment, because I just tweeted something, [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5527.04s)]
*  I was like oh we need the prequel to The Wire, The Omar Years. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5529.04s)]
*  And then he responded like that's a great idea. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5531.599999999999s)]
*  And then that moment I was like, [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5533.839999999999s)]
*  holy shit I'm having a conversation with like a thing, [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5534.8s)]
*  but this is insane. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5537.04s)]
*  But there's another part of this going, [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5538.08s)]
*  holy shit they read everything. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5539.6s)]
*  They read everything about themselves. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5541.84s)]
*  So yeah, if we know that they read everything, [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5544.24s)]
*  she's looked at, oh god they're probably melting right now. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5547.84s)]
*  And then The New York Times drops the article saying that [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5551.28s)]
*  Baldoni orchestrated a smear campaign to quote bury Blake Lively. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5553.68s)]
*  The New York Times article is bad. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5558.4800000000005s)]
*  It doesn't look good for Baldoni at all. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5560.4800000000005s)]
*  And there's pretty crazy lines in here. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5562.8s)]
*  Baldoni wants to make sure that we can bury Blake Lively. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5565.200000000001s)]
*  Apparently Baldoni's PR says you know that we can bury anyone. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5567.360000000001s)]
*  And then there's other messages that are in there where like, [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5571.04s)]
*  they show an article that shows him in The Daily Mail [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5573.92s)]
*  that's slandering Blake Lively's character. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5576.160000000001s)]
*  And the PR people are talking to each other, Baldoni's people, [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5578.240000000001s)]
*  and they're saying like hey you did a great job with this one. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5581.280000000001s)]
*  And then they're responding saying, [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5584.0s)]
*  that's why you hired me, I'm the best in the biz. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5585.6s)]
*  And this is all put into The New York Times article [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5588.400000000001s)]
*  and everyone's like oh they hired a complete PR machine [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5590.240000000001s)]
*  to destroy Blake Lively's career. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5593.44s)]
*  This looks crazy. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5595.12s)]
*  And if he's not guilty, why is he hiring a whole PR team [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5596.32s)]
*  to try to protect his character? [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5598.5599999999995s)]
*  Now he's come out with all these receipts saying [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5601.679999999999s)]
*  that these texts were completely taken out of context. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5604.0s)]
*  That like, for example, with that one situation [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5606.48s)]
*  where she's saying wow you did a great job with this. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5609.599999999999s)]
*  They're all responding that there is a natural narrative [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5611.679999999999s)]
*  against Blake Lively that's brewing, [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5614.32s)]
*  and that they're just monitoring it. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5615.919999999999s)]
*  And so they're just seeing what the narrative is [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5617.839999999999s)]
*  so that he can put out a press release [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5619.599999999999s)]
*  to assess what the sentiment online is. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5621.04s)]
*  And so that's what they're claiming that they're doing. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5624.4s)]
*  So when they see this article that's slandering Blake Lively, [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5626.8s)]
*  she goes sarcastically hey you did a good job with this one. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5629.44s)]
*  I don't know how we're getting so lucky with this, [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5632.48s)]
*  but you killed it with this one. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5634.0s)]
*  And she goes yeah that's why you hired me. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5634.96s)]
*  And puts emojis in there that show that's sarcastic. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5636.64s)]
*  So Blake Lively is like Drake. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5639.2s)]
*  You could say. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5642.4s)]
*  White woman? [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5643.2s)]
*  No, like there's a successful PR campaign [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5645.2s)]
*  that is waged against him. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5648.64s)]
*  And she's basically like it's gotta be bots. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5652.56s)]
*  It's gotta be orchestrated. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5655.360000000001s)]
*  It can't be, there's no way that people [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5657.04s)]
*  really feel this way about me. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5658.320000000001s)]
*  This has gotta be orchestrated by some higher power. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5659.68s)]
*  Yeah, PR campaigns are probably just organic. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5663.280000000001s)]
*  Maybe that's how the people feel. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5665.84s)]
*  Maybe people given this information are reacting [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5667.76s)]
*  according to how we all would act, right? [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5670.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5673.04s)]
*  And so again, if you read the New York Times article, [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5673.92s)]
*  you'll be like oh this Baldoine guy's fucking crazy. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5675.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5677.6s)]
*  There's notes in there where his PR people are like [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5679.12s)]
*  this is gonna be completely untraceable. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5682.08s)]
*  The Times allege that Miss Nathan, Baldoine's PR person, [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5684.32s)]
*  floated proposals to hire contractors to dominate [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5687.92s)]
*  social media through quote full social account takedowns [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5690.08s)]
*  by starting threads of theories and generally working [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5692.639999999999s)]
*  to change the narrative. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5694.799999999999s)]
*  All of this is untraceable. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5696.0s)]
*  What women do we believe? [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5697.28s)]
*  Which version of Blake do we believe? [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5698.799999999999s)]
*  Cause I believe Blake, that's why I'm on Justin's side. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5701.759999999999s)]
*  I believe that woman when she says yo come in it's fine, [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5705.04s)]
*  I'm just pumping it's totally cool. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5709.76s)]
*  I believed her when she said that. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5711.04s)]
*  I don't believe her after the fact when she's trying [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5712.96s)]
*  to get the rights of the movie. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5714.72s)]
*  I believe when she said I got dragons. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5717.5199999999995s)]
*  I believe when she's threatening Justin Baldoine [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5721.76s)]
*  and using the Me Too movement against him. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5724.16s)]
*  I believe that. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5725.92s)]
*  Now this is all from Baldoine that's being released [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5726.8s)]
*  so you're believing just his side. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5728.56s)]
*  No, I'm believing the text exchange. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5730.32s)]
*  It's her. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5731.44s)]
*  I believe what she says. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5732.0s)]
*  It's her words. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5732.96s)]
*  That's true. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5733.6s)]
*  She has not released counter text messages either. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5733.92s)]
*  So you're saying we gotta stop believing all women. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5736.08s)]
*  I mean right when we were believing them. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5739.28s)]
*  Oh boy you are? [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5743.68s)]
*  I was pretending. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5745.2s)]
*  Believe some, believe some. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5746.56s)]
*  I think that's a fair position. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5748.56s)]
*  Believe the last thing a woman says. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5750.16s)]
*  I think that's what the movement really needs to become. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5751.76s)]
*  Okay believe the last thing a woman says. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5754.4800000000005s)]
*  So now Baldoine countersues the New York Times [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5755.92s)]
*  or rather just sues New York Times for 250 million. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5758.0s)]
*  Blake Lively now officially sues after that. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5761.68s)]
*  Justin Baldoine for sexual harassment. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5764.08s)]
*  Civilly or criminally? [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5767.28s)]
*  I believe criminally and it's going to be taken [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5768.4800000000005s)]
*  to the New York Federal Court. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5769.92s)]
*  Oh they don't want that. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5771.52s)]
*  No, I'll tell you. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5772.88s)]
*  They gotta drop this. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5773.92s)]
*  I mean they gotta drop this, just lick their wounds, [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5775.04s)]
*  put out a new Deadpool. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5777.92s)]
*  Baldoine countersues Blake Lively and Reynolds [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5778.8s)]
*  for 400 million for defamation and libel [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5781.12s)]
*  and assassination of character and all that shit. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5784.16s)]
*  Trying to destroy his reputation. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5785.84s)]
*  And then they release. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5787.6s)]
*  Imagine Ryan Reynolds loses all of his mint mobile money [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5789.36s)]
*  because Justin Baldoine couldn't lift up his wife. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5793.68s)]
*  Imagine that. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5799.84s)]
*  Imagine they gotta sell the house, [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5800.8s)]
*  they gotta sell the apartment in Tribeca [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5802.8s)]
*  and when you're explaining to the four kids it's like [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5804.56s)]
*  well yeah your mom put on a few pounds [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5806.320000000001s)]
*  after the last pregnancy and this guy has a back injury, [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5808.400000000001s)]
*  he couldn't lift her up and your mom went fucking batshit crazy. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5811.52s)]
*  So that's what this really comes down to right? [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5816.0s)]
*  Now instead of private school in Tribeca [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5819.76s)]
*  or public school in fucking midtown easy town. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5821.36s)]
*  Oh dude. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5823.92s)]
*  So now people are saying like oh this is, [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5825.679999999999s)]
*  they're calling it DARVO. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5828.48s)]
*  This is what sexual abusers will use. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5829.759999999999s)]
*  They say deny, attack, reverse, victim, offender. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5831.92s)]
*  Oh boy. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5834.639999999999s)]
*  So this is what Baldoine is doing allegedly. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5835.04s)]
*  Is that he's the aggressor but now he's flipping it [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5836.88s)]
*  and reversing it using this tactic called DARVO. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5839.5199999999995s)]
*  It's her fault. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5840.88s)]
*  Is that now he's the victim and that she's the aggressor. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5842.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5845.04s)]
*  And no one knows what to believe. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5845.5199999999995s)]
*  She says in her criminal complaint, [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5847.2s)]
*  which again there's a whole bunch of fucking bureaucs [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5849.44s)]
*  but she says in the criminal complaint that during one of the scenes [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5851.44s)]
*  where they're slow dancing, there's no audio, [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5854.64s)]
*  he's like caressing her, he's like touching her lips, [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5857.04s)]
*  he's trying to kiss her, she feels uncomfortable, [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5859.52s)]
*  she doesn't want it to happen. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5861.36s)]
*  Then they drop the clip. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5862.32s)]
*  And then they drop the clip with audio, [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5863.6s)]
*  which no one knew at that time at least that there was audio. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5865.28s)]
*  We can watch some of it. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5868.24s)]
*  Again this is another like cultural mirage [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5869.12s)]
*  or depending on what you believe, this is what you see. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5872.64s)]
*  I don't think there's any mirage here my man. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5875.04s)]
*  You keep giving these hoes too much credit. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5876.72s)]
*  Geez. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5878.32s)]
*  I'm just saying. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5878.96s)]
*  I'm not with this. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5879.6s)]
*  It's a sexist podcast. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5880.240000000001s)]
*  He got his baldoni bun on son. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5881.280000000001s)]
*  He knows the time of it. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5884.240000000001s)]
*  She got to be six feet tall bro. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5885.84s)]
*  There's no way. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5887.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know bro. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5888.400000000001s)]
*  I got to see that in the script man. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5889.92s)]
*  I got to, I don't like all that improv. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5891.6s)]
*  Like if I'm Ryan Reynolds, I don't think I'm into that. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5895.120000000001s)]
*  So she's suggesting, hey we should be talking. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5898.320000000001s)]
*  We should be talking right now. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5900.160000000001s)]
*  And he's like, oh I think it's more romantic if we just look at each other. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5902.56s)]
*  Almost kissing is also good. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5907.4400000000005s)]
*  And she agrees. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5909.12s)]
*  And she says, but we're still talking. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5910.4s)]
*  I mean it's a movie where people fall in love. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5911.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5913.68s)]
*  If you're Ryan Reynolds, do you not think this is going to happen? [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5914.0s)]
*  But at this point, I'm pretty sure they hate each other. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5917.76s)]
*  Yes. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5920.24s)]
*  Oh, that's what they alleged, the allegations are they hate each other? [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5922.32s)]
*  At this point in the film, I don't know the exact date that this scene happens. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5925.44s)]
*  I'm going to lower the audios. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5928.5599999999995s)]
*  She's a good actor. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5929.92s)]
*  I mean I believe it. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5931.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5932.0s)]
*  All right, so where are we? [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5932.64s)]
*  They come out with this and say this is proof that no sexual misconduct occurred. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5933.76s)]
*  That everything's being talked about, multiple people are there. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5937.76s)]
*  There is no intimacy coordinator, which they say Lively turned down. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5940.160000000001s)]
*  Lively said, I didn't turn it down, I just didn't need it for this scene because in the script, [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5943.92s)]
*  there's no intimacy. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5947.04s)]
*  It's just us dancing. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5948.0s)]
*  Lively's team says this is absolute proof that this guy was being sexually inappropriate on set. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5949.6s)]
*  That he was abusing his power as the director and the producer to have a sexual moment with the lead. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5954.88s)]
*  That he's also the co-lead with. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5961.52s)]
*  Okay. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5962.88s)]
*  And then this basically where it stands, people are like, hey, what does it mean? [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5963.86s)]
*  He puts out the voice recording at this point where people are like, see, this is more proof. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5968.26s)]
*  And then there's a trial date that's set. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5972.42s)]
*  All right, so now we can have fun with this? [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5974.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5978.26s)]
*  So we feel up to date. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5978.74s)]
*  That was a lot. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5979.3s)]
*  That was a lot. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5979.9400000000005s)]
*  I think I felt. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5980.5s)]
*  I can't believe they actually did all that research. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5982.1s)]
*  I'm going to be honest. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5983.78s)]
*  I'm very impressed. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5984.42s)]
*  That was amazing. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5985.46s)]
*  I'm very impressed. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5986.34s)]
*  That was amazing. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5986.82s)]
*  Let's cut 80% of that. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5987.54s)]
*  Yeah, we're going to cut it. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5988.66s)]
*  Why didn't you tell me when we were going to do it? [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5989.9400000000005s)]
*  We're going to trim a little bit. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5991.38s)]
*  Just make sure we don't. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5991.54s)]
*  You did the right thing. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5992.42s)]
*  You did the right thing. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5993.22s)]
*  You did the right thing. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5994.1s)]
*  You were great. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5995.22s)]
*  You were fantastic. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5995.94s)]
*  Can I just say that? [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5996.74s)]
*  No, you need another one of these. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5997.46s)]
*  You need to keep moving. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=5999.54s)]
*  Okay, wow, that was a lot. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6001.14s)]
*  And you know what? [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6002.58s)]
*  You did it in a way that was so diplomatic. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6003.14s)]
*  I'm like, you know, like you kind of made arguments from both sides and everything. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6005.54s)]
*  It was like, really, it was. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6011.78s)]
*  You shouldn't have been more Candace winning and just pick a side and tell the story. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6012.66s)]
*  Candace is going to be. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6016.0199999999995s)]
*  Who's really a man? [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6016.82s)]
*  This is why Candace wins. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6019.94s)]
*  Her retention throughout that story is going to the roof. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6022.1s)]
*  And ours is like, oh, but it's so gray. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6025.14s)]
*  Like, no, we don't want gray. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6027.46s)]
*  I need the strong, bold colors. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6029.06s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6032.0199999999995s)]
*  Now I actually, oh, man. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6032.9s)]
*  I know. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6034.98s)]
*  Tell us, Akash. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6036.58s)]
*  Go. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6038.0199999999995s)]
*  And the second a white woman in Hollywood is talking about sexual harassment, I'm skeptical. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6038.66s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6044.9s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6045.78s)]
*  Keep going. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6046.74s)]
*  Keep going. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6047.3s)]
*  What? [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6047.94s)]
*  Just because they subscribe to the New Yorker, I got to pretend I believe these hoes? [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6048.18s)]
*  I don't. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6052.42s)]
*  I don't trust them. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6052.98s)]
*  Tell us, tell us, tell us. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6054.0199999999995s)]
*  Well, none of this seems like it's a fucking movie where they fall in love and you expect [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6055.22s)]
*  us to have a platonic dancing scene. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6059.06s)]
*  Yes. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6061.06s)]
*  Are we doing a movie or not? [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6061.38s)]
*  You're an actress. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6063.3s)]
*  You would be uncomfortable with your wife doing it. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6064.34s)]
*  She's not an actress. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6065.94s)]
*  You don't. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6067.14s)]
*  She's not signing up for that. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6067.62s)]
*  You'd be like, what the fuck are you hugging this guy for? [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6068.82s)]
*  If your wife is an actress, the day you meet, you met her on a fucking movie, Ryan Reynolds. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6070.82s)]
*  What do you think she was doing? [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6075.22s)]
*  That's why to me, if there's a love scene. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6076.66s)]
*  I feel uncomfortable with the daddy daughter dancing my wedding. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6078.66s)]
*  I'm dead. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6081.38s)]
*  I said back it up. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6087.78s)]
*  Back it up. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6089.54s)]
*  Doctor. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6090.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6090.820000000001s)]
*  Nah, it's gotta be a chicken dance or something. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6091.54s)]
*  Yeah, we can do it all day. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6093.3s)]
*  It can't be a cute song. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6094.5s)]
*  Just in general, I think if you've grown up around actual abuse and you see people [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6096.9800000000005s)]
*  calling certain shit abuse, you're like, what are you fucking talking about? [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6100.34s)]
*  If you know actual sexual assault victims and then they start saying, oh, this is sexual [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6103.54s)]
*  assault, it's very obvious because he mentions his wife a minute in, first of all, like whatever. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6107.7s)]
*  It's so obvious what's happening. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6113.54s)]
*  No, it's not. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6115.0599999999995s)]
*  This is not sexual assault and painting this as sexual assault is insane to me. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6116.099999999999s)]
*  So they're like all abuse matters and you're like, just yours. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6119.94s)]
*  Correct. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6123.46s)]
*  I was uncomfortable, ain't abuse. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6126.5s)]
*  You're uncomfortable, bitch. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6128.26s)]
*  You would know they fuck. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6132.0199999999995s)]
*  I heard two fucking, I heard 20 minutes of an audio book. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6134.099999999999s)]
*  They fucked in those 20 minutes. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6137.46s)]
*  What did you think was going to happen? [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6139.14s)]
*  Were you not going to be uncomfortable with that? [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6140.82s)]
*  Maybe you should have had an inter-music coordinator the whole fucking time. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6142.42s)]
*  It's insane to me that we let these people go on with this fucking narrative and we're like, [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6145.46s)]
*  oh my God, see, he's sniffing her. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6149.46s)]
*  Of course, bitch, you're going to be cheek to cheek. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6151.94s)]
*  It's a dance where you fall in love. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6153.94s)]
*  But what do you think this is supposed to be? [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6156.18s)]
*  I'm not dancing like that. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6158.42s)]
*  I'm not doing this movie. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6159.7s)]
*  I'm not handsome enough to be a lead in anything. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6160.66s)]
*  You're right. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6163.46s)]
*  1000%. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6164.34s)]
*  People also point out, why would he, this guy that has a Hollywood career, sexually [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6168.5s)]
*  harass a woman who comes from a legacy family that's not young in the scene, [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6173.06s)]
*  she's not a fringe character, she's the co-lead and a producer. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6177.38s)]
*  According to him, she's fat. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6180.42s)]
*  It can't be both. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6184.42s)]
*  You got to go to your trainer like, how much, bro? [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6186.82s)]
*  It's not sexual harassment. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6189.860000000001s)]
*  It could be harassment. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6190.900000000001s)]
*  That is another thing that, have we spoken about that? [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6191.860000000001s)]
*  It could be harassment, but adding sexual, you don't know my intentions. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6194.900000000001s)]
*  If you just were like, hey, I felt harassed by you talking about my weight, that's fine. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6201.22s)]
*  But you're assuming I want to fuck you, which is arrogant. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6205.14s)]
*  I think one of the texts he put out, he's like, I'm not even attracted to you. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6209.22s)]
*  Like, he's told it straight out. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6212.18s)]
*  Yeah, that is, what is it called? [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6213.860000000001s)]
*  That is a little bit of, what is it? [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6217.38s)]
*  Presumptuous. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6219.54s)]
*  That is presumptuous of you to assume sexual harassment. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6220.18s)]
*  Now, does sexual harassment mean how you feel? [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6223.54s)]

*  At a certain level of good looking, [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6271.14s)]
*  you're not allowed to talk about your insecure. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6272.5s)]

*  Do you know what I mean? [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6277.38s)]
*  If you're, the guy's fucking handsome and you got a big nose, [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6278.18s)]

*  Because that big nose, though. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6289.219999999999s)]

*  So you need that second pair just in case. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6293.7s)]
*  That's sexual harassment. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6294.98s)]
*  Noses are very sexual. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6295.86s)]
*  Noses are. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6296.9s)]

*  Make his nose look big. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6304.099999999999s)]
*  Give him another big nose. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6304.98s)]
*  That is true. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6306.74s)]
*  Why do you hate Jews? [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6307.299999999999s)]
*  Why? [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6308.419999999999s)]

*  He was ashamed. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6310.0199999999995s)]
*  At how small his nose was. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6311.14s)]
*  You're saying Jews have big noses. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6312.18s)]
*  I just want to point that out. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6314.02s)]
*  That was such a pussy win, man. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6315.46s)]

*  Why not? [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6431.860000000001s)]
*  I don't have a cut. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6432.26s)]
*  I don't feel comfortable. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6432.9800000000005s)]
*  You're making me uncomfortable. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6433.780000000001s)]
*  Am I making you uncomfortable right now? [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6434.660000000001s)]
*  All right, fair enough. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6435.860000000001s)]
*  The lead is 23 in the book. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6436.26s)]
*  Yeah, and she's 35. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6437.860000000001s)]
*  I mean, what are we doing, dude? [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6439.3s)]
*  And then on top of that, she's dressing older, it seems like. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6441.06s)]
*  So the character is 40. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6443.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6446.740000000001s)]
*  Why do you think that this is such a huge story? [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6447.46s)]
*  Why do you think that people care so much about this? [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6450.820000000001s)]
*  I think it really captured. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6452.740000000001s)]
*  A lot of men felt very angry by the Me Too movement. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6454.1s)]
*  I actually truly wasn't. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6457.14s)]
*  All jokes aside, I'm not that guy, but they love this story [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6458.42s)]
*  because it's the woman seemingly- [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6460.820000000001s)]
*  It's proof. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6463.14s)]
*  Being wrong. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6463.9400000000005s)]
*  Here's an example of- [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6464.26s)]
*  It's proof that they're all- [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6465.22s)]
*  Now you have to believe any of it. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6466.740000000001s)]
*  So they just fucking glom onto it and they run with it. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6468.42s)]
*  And I think that's the reason [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6470.900000000001s)]
*  the right wing is really eating this story up. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6472.900000000001s)]
*  Candice and Ben Shapiro doing this story is wild. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6475.54s)]
*  It also proves- [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6477.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but they're- [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6478.5s)]
*  I mean, Ben is just going to do the story [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6479.22s)]
*  about whatever the most popular thing is. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6481.3s)]
*  Like, he did a story on Wicked. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6482.820000000001s)]
*  He's doing it because he sees Candice's numbers [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6484.58s)]
*  and he's like, oh shit. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6486.5s)]
*  Oh, we got to eat that. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6487.62s)]
*  Yeah, 50,000 people on live, dog. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6488.42s)]
*  Talking about this, Candice. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6490.339999999999s)]
*  On YouTube alone. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6491.78s)]
*  Candice, I believe. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6492.5s)]
*  I don't need to hear Ben Shapiro talk about, [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6494.099999999999s)]
*  what is this called? [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6496.179999999999s)]
*  This is us? [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6496.74s)]
*  You don't want to hear him say what again. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6497.219999999999s)]
*  It also proves that the Hollywood elites are bad people. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6500.74s)]
*  Oh, that's true as well. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6504.099999999999s)]
*  That's what I'm trying to say. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6505.62s)]
*  What are the little tent poles? [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6506.42s)]
*  What are the things this is touching on? [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6508.66s)]
*  I definitely think it's this feeling [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6509.7s)]
*  that the Me Too movement was kind of used as a weapon. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6512.18s)]
*  So that definitely is going to rub some people the wrong way. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6515.86s)]
*  Maybe there is some Hollywood here. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6518.0199999999995s)]
*  We didn't even touch on any of the Taylor stuff. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6520.34s)]
*  It's also just people with power taking advantage of people [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6523.7s)]
*  who are essentially powerless. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6526.34s)]
*  I don't know if I look at Justin Belanger as powerless, [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6527.94s)]
*  but what's interesting is here's this guy [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6529.7s)]
*  who exemplifies the fake male feminists [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6532.26s)]
*  that all these right-wing dudes have hated. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6536.099999999999s)]
*  The liberal cock or whatever like that. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6539.7s)]
*  Now all of a sudden, [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6541.94s)]
*  because he's being taken advantage by this Me Too system, [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6542.9s)]
*  he's their... [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6545.78s)]
*  He's our guy. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6546.98s)]
*  I don't even want to say their hero, [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6548.26s)]
*  but he's the person that they want to defend. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6549.38s)]
*  It's kind of an interesting thing. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6551.38s)]
*  You have to defend the exact guy you hate. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6552.26s)]
*  Because you hate someone else more. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6554.98s)]
*  You see these people that are like, [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6556.98s)]
*  oh, fake woke and they want everyone to be happy [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6558.18s)]
*  and they want equity [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6560.42s)]
*  and they're donating to brown people in different countries. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6561.22s)]
*  And then the second someone focuses their money, [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6564.34s)]
*  they're coming for it. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6566.34s)]
*  They're slandering him. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6567.06s)]
*  They're taking his name. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6567.7s)]
*  They're running through the dirt. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6568.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6569.62s)]
*  You know what's really telling? [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6570.82s)]
*  The fact that Taylor Swift distanced herself from her. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6571.94s)]
*  This is a friend of 10 years and Miss Taylor... [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6575.54s)]
*  God parent, one of the kids. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6578.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6579.78s)]
*  Taylor's like, oh, believe women everything. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6580.18s)]
*  I remember she came to Kesha's defense [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6583.14s)]
*  and I gave her like 250,000 when that guy, [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6585.14s)]
*  like the producer, smacked the butt or something like that. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6588.26s)]
*  So this, your best friend... [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6590.1s)]
*  You don't even know if that's what happened. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6592.74s)]
*  I thought it was like a little shit. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6595.3s)]
*  The producer could have brutally... [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6595.78s)]
*  I thought that was a little shit. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6597.94s)]
*  He turned it into like, yo, good singing Kesha. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6598.9s)]
*  Nice job, Turner. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6603.459999999999s)]
*  I'm not saying it was legit. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6604.66s)]
*  You're just like, ass slap. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6607.219999999999s)]
*  I'm missing a little ass slap. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6609.299999999999s)]
*  At least. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6611.86s)]
*  I'm just saying. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6612.259999999999s)]
*  Normally... [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6613.54s)]
*  That sounds crazy. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6613.7s)]
*  Like normally Taylor would come to someone's, [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6614.9s)]
*  another woman's defense who's claiming sexual assault. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6618.0199999999995s)]
*  But the fact that she's stepping aside... [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6620.0199999999995s)]
*  Is telling. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6621.62s)]
*  And everyone was very conspiracy theory [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6622.58s)]
*  and they're like, oh, Taylor's gonna be the Super Bowl [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6624.5s)]
*  and Blake Lab's gonna be right next to her. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6625.86s)]
*  And she's gonna show that that's her girl [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6627.46s)]
*  and that they're riding together. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6628.98s)]
*  And then she wasn't there. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6630.179999999999s)]
*  So if you're Blake and Ryan, how do you get out of this? [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6631.94s)]
*  If you're Ryan, you're a billion dollar business, right? [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6635.54s)]
*  I don't know what Blake's career is right now. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6637.94s)]
*  But if you're Ryan, you are a billion dollar business, right? [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6639.78s)]
*  Obviously you're getting phone calls from Marvel, Sony, [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6642.339999999999s)]
*  all these different production companies you're involved in. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6644.9s)]
*  You got the football team out there. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6646.9s)]
*  Everybody that you're making money with, [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6648.58s)]
*  and you are the celebrity CEO, right? [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6650.179999999999s)]
*  He's decided, I'm gonna be the CEO of Minter Aviation. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6653.46s)]
*  Mine is touch, dude. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6655.9400000000005s)]
*  Everything he touches, blows up. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6656.82s)]
*  But it's not just like touching and move on. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6658.74s)]
*  You are the ambassador. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6660.900000000001s)]
*  So as your stock goes down, [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6662.74s)]
*  so does the stock of these companies you represent. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6664.5s)]
*  It's the gift of the curse. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6666.9800000000005s)]
*  But a man is not a career alone. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6668.02s)]
*  A man is a career and a family. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6669.86s)]
*  And now he's committed to his wife. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6671.7s)]
*  He can't just let his wife drown. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6673.62s)]
*  Now he gotta separate himself. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6675.14s)]
*  He gotta separate himself. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6677.54s)]
*  He's like, I'm taking some time away from him. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6678.5s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6680.1s)]
*  You don't have to do that. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6681.3s)]
*  But he's in a tough spot, [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6682.34s)]
*  because if he rides with Blake, [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6683.22s)]
*  it's possible he could tank his career. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6684.42s)]
*  But if he distances himself, [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6686.1s)]
*  then it's possible he could lose his family. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6687.46s)]
*  So what do you do? [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6689.9400000000005s)]
*  Do you, hmm. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6691.22s)]
*  What do you do if you're there? [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6693.7s)]
*  We have an all-hands-on-deck meeting at the house. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6694.900000000001s)]
*  Blake, shut up. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6698.5s)]
*  There's another project out there. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6701.06s)]
*  You can have your acting career somewhere else. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6702.9800000000005s)]
*  We're letting this go for now. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6704.9800000000005s)]
*  There's a billion dollars left. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6706.66s)]
*  But I think Ry is the one who wants the project. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6707.38s)]
*  You know what I think you could do? [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6709.46s)]
*  I bet you. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6710.58s)]
*  Oh, that's interesting. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6712.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6712.9800000000005s)]
*  Oh, I think he wants it, of course. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6713.22s)]
*  But he ain't getting it. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6714.26s)]
*  I bet you they could call Baldoni. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6714.9800000000005s)]
*  My assumption is Baldoni really wants to be seen as the good guy [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6718.740000000001s)]
*  who cares about women [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6722.18s)]
*  and wants to change the image of masculinity or whatever it is. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6723.9400000000005s)]
*  I'll gosh that exists. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6727.38s)]
*  There are guys that care about women in the world. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6730.18s)]
*  Just. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6731.860000000001s)]
*  You ain't want them. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6732.26s)]
*  I love them. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6734.34s)]
*  I love them. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6734.900000000001s)]
*  We know. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6736.58s)]
*  I bet you they could pull Baldoni aside and say, [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6737.06s)]
*  listen, we want to publicly apologize. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6749.22s)]
*  Is there any way you can help us say face here? [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6751.620000000001s)]
*  We'll drop the lawsuit. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6753.700000000001s)]
*  We want to say that there's misinterpretations. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6755.06s)]
*  You get to be the good guy, [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6757.14s)]
*  but is there a way that we could not be so bad? [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6758.34s)]
*  And you get to be the hero here. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6761.22s)]
*  You get to be the person that forgives and doesn't understand. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6762.580000000001s)]
*  There was misinterpretation and you understand why she felt certain ways. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6765.54s)]
*  But we apologize and we completely vindicate you. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6768.74s)]
*  And then we come together. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6771.7s)]
*  We even make the next movie. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6772.66s)]
*  But I bet he cares so much about his image that he would drop everything. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6773.94s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6777.86s)]
*  100% disagree. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6778.66s)]
*  Definitely not. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6779.94s)]
*  He got that billionaire backing him. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6780.58s)]
*  He's like, let's go to war. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6782.58s)]
*  My case is so strong. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6783.86s)]
*  If you're not giving me $100 million that apology, [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6786.18s)]
*  because what are you offering me the good guy role that I already seemingly have? [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6789.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6792.34s)]
*  You're gonna, hey, we're gonna make you seem good. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6793.64s)]
*  It's like me telling you, hey, man, if we had a beef, imagine I came to you like, [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6796.2s)]
*  hey, man, I'll help you sell some comedy tickets. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6799.08s)]
*  You just be like, I'm already selling fucking arena. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6801.24s)]
*  I need you. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6803.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6804.4400000000005s)]
*  Fuck you offering me. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6804.76s)]
*  Yeah, but I care less about public perception than Justin Bell, though. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6805.96s)]
*  Yeah, but I'm saying like the public perception is already on his side. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6809.0s)]
*  That's true. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6812.04s)]
*  So you're offering him something you already have. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6812.360000000001s)]
*  In a way that like some comic comes to you like, I'll help you sell out MSG. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6813.88s)]
*  You'd be like, done. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6816.6s)]
*  That is true. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6817.08s)]
*  But while you're, he's not radioactive. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6817.4800000000005s)]
*  The people think he's a good guy, but it's not selling in court yet. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6821.4s)]
*  So I don't know if he's getting work. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6824.759999999999s)]
*  And there's that saying in Hollywood, right? [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6827.0s)]
*  You could either work or you could sue. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6828.759999999999s)]
*  And I wonder if he's like, I want to get back to working. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6830.839999999999s)]
*  I want to get back to making movies. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6833.24s)]
*  But you know, I can't make a movie because no studio is going to fund a movie while this court [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6834.28s)]
*  case is held up. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6837.48s)]
*  So I literally cannot work. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6839.48s)]
*  I cannot make money. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6841.08s)]
*  I can't even use all this positive press that I got because this court case and they're [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6842.04s)]
*  going to string this shit on as long as they possibly can. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6846.28s)]
*  And they got big bank, right? [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6848.599999999999s)]
*  Baldoni got some big backers, but I don't know how much money he actually has. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6849.96s)]
*  I don't know how much he wants to spend on court fees. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6853.4s)]
*  So I wonder if they caught him like, yeah, we're going to squash this all. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6855.56s)]
*  You get to be the hero, but we need you to just make her and me not look horrible. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6858.28s)]
*  It was some misinterpretation. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6864.52s)]
*  Let's move forward. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6865.8s)]
*  Let's make another movie. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6866.44s)]
*  This is our bad. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6867.8s)]
*  Can I tell you, the suit is also levied not only against Baldoni, I'm pretty sure it's [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6868.44s)]
*  levied against the production company and the other billionaire producers. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6872.28s)]
*  The Blake Lively lawsuit. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6875.64s)]
*  Yeah, that lawsuit. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6876.84s)]
*  So here's what I was going to say. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6877.4800000000005s)]
*  And they're friends with the other people producing movies and they're going to go, [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6879.08s)]
*  do you really want to make a movie with this guy? [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6881.8s)]
*  He made this girl feel uncomfortable. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6883.4s)]
*  I'm this what I'm saying. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6884.92s)]
*  This is a web. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6886.12s)]
*  This is not an individual situation. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6887.16s)]
*  Like all these producers are going to look at him and right now he's the hero of the [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6890.44s)]
*  internet and you know, Candace has got his back and all these girls on TikTok have got [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6893.719999999999s)]
*  his back for this month. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6897.719999999999s)]
*  They're going to have a new story that they care about next month, but that lawsuit is [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6898.599999999999s)]
*  going to still be gone. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6901.08s)]
*  I wonder if there's a conversation behind closed doors where they just go, [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6902.12s)]
*  you get to be the hero. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6905.4s)]
*  We will apologize. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6906.28s)]
*  We'll say we misinterpreted things and it was fucked up and there's things that we [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6907.16s)]
*  wish we could have changed, but now we see it from your side and there's some sort of [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6910.36s)]
*  reconciliation and we move on and everybody gets to work. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6914.5199999999995s)]
*  What's tricky is that they already tried to force him to put out an apology. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6918.2s)]
*  So they wrote an apology for him when they had all the producers there. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6921.48s)]
*  Who was they? [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6923.48s)]
*  Blake and... [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6924.12s)]
*  When Reynolds was yelling at him, they gave him an apology and they said, [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6924.68s)]
*  you got to put this out. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6927.88s)]
*  We wrote it and it says there's been problems on the set. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6928.68s)]
*  I take accountability. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6931.639999999999s)]
*  That's what it means to be man enough, quoting his podcast name. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6932.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6935.48s)]
*  And it's my fault and there's some misunderstandings, but everything's good. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6935.799999999999s)]
*  So they tried to get him to do an apology and he said no. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6939.16s)]
*  I don't think he got to apologize. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6941.24s)]
*  I think that he's just got to go, I see where they went wrong [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6943.08s)]
*  and I really appreciate their apology. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6947.639999999999s)]
*  I don't think that they're bad people. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6949.719999999999s)]
*  They misinterpreted some things. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6951.48s)]
*  I think now they understand where things are coming from, [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6952.599999999999s)]
*  but I think it's best that we all kind of move on and then we made a great movie that [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6955.48s)]
*  people love. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6958.679999999999s)]
*  Let's make more. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6959.24s)]
*  Let's continue to work because he doesn't want to be four years not working because [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6959.96s)]
*  people will forget about this movie. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6962.92s)]
*  Remember, memories are short. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6964.44s)]
*  Four years from now, when he wants to make a new thing, [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6965.719999999999s)]
*  people are going to go, thank God Justin Boudoni's back. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6967.16s)]
*  Here's why. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6969.4s)]
*  Here's where I put it. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6969.48s)]
*  But he still has the rights. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6969.96s)]
*  Say it. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6970.839999999999s)]
*  He still has the rights to either their sequel or their prequel. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6971.16s)]
*  You can have the rights to whatever you want if a producer's not going to put 25 million [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6973.0s)]
*  up for you to make the movie. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6976.679999999999s)]
*  Well, the production company's got his back. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6977.5599999999995s)]
*  If the agency isn't going to put actors in that movie, there's no way. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6979.08s)]
*  And the actors might be friends. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6982.5199999999995s)]
*  Here's why. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6983.799999999999s)]
*  I'm telling you, it's like, yes, it makes sense on the surface what you guys are saying, [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6984.599999999999s)]
*  but did you see how quickly Blake got the feminist chick that hosts the podcast with him? [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6988.36s)]
*  They know each other. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6994.2s)]
*  They do a podcast every week with their friends. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6994.92s)]
*  She knows who he is intimately. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6996.92s)]
*  And at the idea of a better opportunity, she immediately went with the... [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=6998.679999999999s)]
*  This is a girl who built her whole identity online around being a feminist. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7003.0s)]
*  Immediately throws this guy down the river for the people she doesn't even fucking know [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7006.84s)]
*  because they're more powerful and offer more opportunities. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7010.5199999999995s)]
*  Here's what I would say. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7012.04s)]
*  I'm just saying, if that's some podcast host going to do it, [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7013.8s)]
*  you don't think some fledgling actors in Hollywood would also do it in a heartbeat. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7016.44s)]
*  So here's what I'll say. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7019.8s)]
*  That's why the whole cast, real quick, [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7020.28s)]
*  that's why the whole cast was supporting Ryan and Blake. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7021.799999999999s)]
*  It wasn't... [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7025.32s)]
*  I don't think it's because they 100% believe they were right. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7026.44s)]
*  They believe that their future salvation was in Ryan and Blake's hands [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7029.0s)]
*  and in the studios that support them and not this independent. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7032.92s)]
*  But that was before the tech came out. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7035.5599999999995s)]
*  True. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7037.0s)]
*  If you're settling, you better attach a big number to that settlement. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7037.4s)]
*  Or like if you're whatever, apologizing, I need some money. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7040.28s)]
*  Also the saying, you can sue or you can work. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7042.92s)]
*  I do believe that. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7044.759999999999s)]
*  The second, they sued him. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7045.879999999999s)]
*  They put him in a position where it's like, all right, well, [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7047.96s)]
*  my only way out is to counter sue. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7051.0s)]
*  But since I'm suing, I have to ask for such an enormous amount of money. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7052.36s)]
*  I never have to work again because I'm probably not going to work after this. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7057.08s)]
*  And then there's also, there's one great scene in The Office [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7060.76s)]
*  where the main character, Michael Scott, is trying to negotiate with the company [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7064.6s)]
*  that he works for, Mike, whatever, Dunham Mifflin. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7070.76s)]
*  And they're like, you don't have time. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7073.24s)]
*  I know what's going to happen. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7075.08s)]
*  You can't sustain your business. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7075.96s)]
*  You can't whatever. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7077.08s)]
*  And then he says, essentially, listen, I don't... [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7077.96s)]
*  I just have to wait you out. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7081.56s)]
*  I just have to wait you out. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7082.76s)]
*  I don't need to win anything. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7084.36s)]
*  I don't need to make business. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7085.4s)]
*  I just got to wait you. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7086.2s)]
*  If I'm Blake, if I'm Justin Baldoni, I say to Blake and Ryan, [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7086.92s)]
*  you don't think I can win this lawsuit. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7090.44s)]
*  I don't think you can lose any more than you're already losing. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7092.44s)]
*  Your public perception is being fucking tanked. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7095.72s)]
*  And I think that drives you way more crazy and hurts your net worth [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7098.04s)]
*  way more than it hurts mine. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7101.48s)]
*  I just got to wait you out. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7102.68s)]
*  So if you're going to give me 100 million, cool. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7104.52s)]
*  Wayfair got to wait you out, not Justin. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7106.44s)]
*  And at what point does Wayfair go, all right, bro, like I had your back. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7108.6s)]
*  But now we're five years into this lawsuit. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7112.68s)]
*  I've done 50 million in lawyer fees. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7114.52s)]
*  We still haven't gotten anywhere. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7116.280000000001s)]
*  No, but if they sued the billionaire also, that motherfucker got empty. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7117.72s)]
*  Like endless pockets. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7122.4400000000005s)]
*  And Justin and Blake don't have endless pockets. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7124.6s)]
*  Who's your backer? [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7126.84s)]
*  Because if it's your backer versus my backer, if your backer is you, [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7127.96s)]
*  I promise my backer can... [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7130.84s)]
*  A big bank can take a little bit. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7132.4400000000005s)]
*  This is so many lawsuits. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7134.360000000001s)]
*  And if he wins, that is the ultimate victory. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7135.88s)]
*  That is Goliath and whatever the guy is. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7139.16s)]
*  I got my money. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7141.96s)]
*  I got public perception. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7142.84s)]
*  I'm on a roll, guys. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7144.68s)]
*  I didn't see it. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7146.04s)]
*  I get what you're saying. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7147.56s)]
*  I 100% get what you're saying. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7149.64s)]
*  We always root for the underdog. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7150.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I get what you're saying. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7152.2s)]
*  I think the people root for it. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7153.96s)]
*  I do think that you underestimate people's attention spans with things. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7155.08s)]
*  And I think the people are eventually just going to stop caring about this. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7160.52s)]
*  Like they stop caring about any trending topic. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7162.92s)]
*  There's going to be a new thing. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7164.6s)]
*  And then when the people stop caring, who's in the advantageous position? [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7165.64s)]
*  I think Baldoni. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7169.8s)]
*  I think six months from now, let's say nothing changes and it's just a stalemate waiting for court. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7171.4800000000005s)]
*  I think people go and they go, oh yeah, it wasn't Blake Lively a bitch. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7175.72s)]
*  Who got more to lose? [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7178.4400000000005s)]
*  I think that's what the average person thinks. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7179.8s)]
*  That's what I'm trying to say. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7181.08s)]
*  But if I'm Ryan and Blake, I'm like, there's no way... [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7181.88s)]
*  I'm assuming there's no way they win this lawsuit. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7187.4800000000005s)]
*  So the only thing they can do is stretch it out to the point where there's a settle [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7190.6s)]
*  or people decide to go their own way. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7193.64s)]
*  Because it seems like with the information out there, they can't win. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7196.4400000000005s)]
*  A court date is set. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7198.92s)]
*  They can't push it back. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7200.4400000000005s)]
*  They don't want to go to court. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7201.08s)]
*  But that's what I'm saying. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7202.04s)]
*  So it's like it's going to get settled sometime before March of next year. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7202.76s)]
*  So you can settle, but you don't have to cut a big check. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7206.76s)]
*  You can't just say, hey, we'll apologize in a saw. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7209.240000000001s)]
*  If I'm Baldoni, I'm like, you can apologize. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7212.52s)]
*  That's great. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7214.76s)]
*  I need 100 Ms. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7215.64s)]
*  Otherwise you're out. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7217.08s)]
*  If they pay any money, it's over for them. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7217.8s)]
*  That's the thing. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7219.56s)]
*  If... [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7220.12s)]
*  But the terms of settlement don't get released or that could be part of the... [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7220.4400000000005s)]
*  That always gets released. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7222.76s)]
*  Baldoni's lawyer is making their life hell. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7223.72s)]
*  He's saying like, oh, Taylor Swift was involved in casting, [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7226.280000000001s)]
*  which is what one of the actors said. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7228.92s)]
*  So now she's the producer. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7230.280000000001s)]
*  Taylor Swift was involved with the music and she was in production. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7230.92s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7233.16s)]
*  She helped rewrite one of the scenes. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7233.64s)]
*  We got to depose her. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7235.16s)]
*  And now he's trying to leverage that, which is why Taylor's now saying like, [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7236.68s)]
*  I wasn't really involved or... [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7239.96s)]
*  He's trying to make everybody around them's life miserable [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7241.24s)]
*  so that they start putting pressure on Ryan and Blake and go, [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7244.2s)]
*  yo, get me the fuck out of this. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7246.92s)]
*  If you're Jinn Aviation, if you're Mint Mobile, [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7249.08s)]
*  if you're the fucking FX producers, welcome to Rexam or whatever it's called, [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7251.08s)]
*  Rob McElhaney who does this. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7254.12s)]
*  Are you not looking at them like, what the fuck are y'all doing? [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7255.64s)]
*  Baldoni's guys are saying, hey, fight the good fight. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7258.92s)]
*  We got your back. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7261.5599999999995s)]
*  Their guys are saying, our net worth is tanking because of you. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7262.84s)]
*  What the fuck are you doing? [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7267.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7268.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7269.08s)]
*  I just think that's a bigger deal than... [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7269.88s)]
*  I just think the only cards that they have to play [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7271.5599999999995s)]
*  are Reconciliation with Baldoni and playing into his ego. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7275.08s)]
*  And the only thing they can do right now, [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7278.44s)]
*  and a lot of money. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7281.64s)]
*  You got him dropped from his agency like he's already tainted in Hollywood. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7283.56s)]
*  What they're alleging is Ryan Reynolds had already been putting pressure on WME [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7287.8s)]
*  to drop Baldoni. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7291.240000000001s)]
*  And if you are WME, you're going to want to side with Ryan Reynolds [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7292.4400000000005s)]
*  the second that article drops. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7295.64s)]
*  All right, fine. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7296.76s)]
*  Now we got a reason. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7297.16s)]
*  Let's go. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7297.8s)]
*  You're out. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7298.52s)]
*  I mean, this is a tough thing. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7300.6s)]
*  If you're an agency, you like that check that Ryan gives you every single month. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7302.6s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7306.04s)]
*  You're making more money for you than Baldoni. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7307.0s)]
*  Way more money than Baldoni. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7308.4400000000005s)]
*  WME for that either. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7310.5199999999995s)]
*  So that's what you do. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7311.48s)]
*  All of those people. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7312.12s)]
*  How many people are committed to Ryan Reynolds? [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7313.08s)]
*  How many people are going to fight tooth and nail to make sure [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7317.32s)]
*  he doesn't lose this lawsuit? [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7320.599999999999s)]
*  And Baldoni has to decide if he thinks it's winnable [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7322.92s)]
*  knowing this many people are trying to take him out. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7328.04s)]
*  But Baldoni is in such an advantageous position, [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7330.44s)]
*  which is why also this is such a big story because all the texts are leaked. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7332.28s)]
*  It's just feeding the fucking gossip sites for generations. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7335.32s)]
*  And WME doesn't back you. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7337.96s)]
*  They'll drop anybody at any point. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7340.28s)]
*  Any agency will drop anyone. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7342.04s)]
*  Baldoni needs to donate millions of dollars to whatever cause Candace Owens cares the most about. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7343.32s)]
*  Because what she has done to shift the online narrative about this. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7352.28s)]
*  It was already there, but she definitely... [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7358.92s)]
*  I think she organized it. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7361.799999999999s)]
*  It was there and it was kind of fractured. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7365.0s)]
*  And some people believe this. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7366.679999999999s)]
*  And I would ask people. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7367.799999999999s)]
*  I'd always ask, like, I'm his friends. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7368.52s)]
*  I'd be like, yes, how do you feel about this? [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7369.72s)]
*  Who do you think? [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7371.0s)]
*  Or whatever. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7371.4800000000005s)]
*  Once Candace started putting those things out, [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7372.52s)]
*  it was a unanimous decision immediately from every person I asked. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7374.6s)]
*  And I know they only watched three minutes of TikTok, but it was unanimous. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7379.0s)]
*  I don't think my wife has ever watched Candace before. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7383.4800000000005s)]
*  So dumb of her, Candace, by the way. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7386.6s)]
*  And then the first thing she referenced when she was talking about it, [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7390.280000000001s)]
*  she was like, I was watching the Candace break this whole thing down. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7392.92s)]
*  It was crazy. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7395.4800000000005s)]
*  It's interesting. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7396.68s)]
*  Yeah, I think, I don't know, like, what would you do if you're Ryan and Blake? [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7398.2s)]
*  I would drop, yo, drop it immediately. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7402.12s)]
*  Whatever you need. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7404.84s)]
*  And if I'm thinking of the pressure they must be going through, [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7406.04s)]
*  again, you're worth upwards of a billion dollars. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7408.92s)]
*  Even if you're not there, you're getting there. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7410.92s)]
*  This ain't worth it. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7412.84s)]
*  What are we doing? [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7413.719999999999s)]
*  It was a fucking cute movie. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7414.84s)]
*  Get out of here. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7416.44s)]
*  We're getting out while the getting is good. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7417.16s)]
*  I would have never taken it this far. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7419.08s)]
*  It depends on what they have. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7421.96s)]
*  It depends what their hand is. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7423.719999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7425.0s)]
*  Like, Baldoine just showed. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7425.4s)]
*  He's like, yo, I got two kings. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7426.28s)]
*  They're playing blackjack. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7428.28s)]
*  It's like, maybe they got an ace. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7429.32s)]
*  You don't know. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7431.0s)]
*  So you just got to wait. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7431.8s)]
*  And then if they fold and it's like, yeah, they were bluffing. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7432.679999999999s)]
*  And if they go to court, then they're like, no, we think we got. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7435.719999999999s)]
*  I'm inclined to believe if you had an ace and you have you're losing that much, [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7437.719999999999s)]
*  you play your ace. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7441.719999999999s)]
*  You show your hand. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7442.84s)]
*  Call. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7444.36s)]
*  Do you want to put it in the court of public opinion [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7445.24s)]
*  to let it then get potentially thrown out in court? [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7447.32s)]
*  Or do you just wait till the court date? [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7449.88s)]
*  We're going to sit on it because we know we're going to win in court. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7451.32s)]
*  I mean, that's fine. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7453.48s)]
*  That's a year from now. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7454.2s)]
*  What happens to Ryan Reynolds if they lose? [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7455.16s)]
*  I don't think much. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7459.32s)]
*  Reynolds be OK. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7460.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7461.24s)]
*  I think Reynolds will be OK. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7461.88s)]
*  Blake toast. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7462.76s)]
*  Yeah, Blake. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7463.8s)]
*  Reynolds can hide behind. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7464.28s)]
*  Listen, I was supporting my wife. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7465.24s)]
*  My wife was telling me she was feeling uncomfortable. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7466.44s)]
*  Blah, blah, blah. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7468.44s)]
*  I got to go do this. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7469.08s)]
*  She says she doesn't like this guy, so I'm going to make fun of him in my movies. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7470.2s)]
*  I got her back no matter what. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7473.16s)]
*  I'm a supportive husband. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7474.44s)]
*  You know, I would have liked if maybe there was a little bit more transparency [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7475.64s)]
*  about what actually happens. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7479.16s)]
*  But I got to support my wife. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7480.68s)]
*  I think that we can get behind him on that 100%. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7482.36s)]
*  And I think she got to take that on the chin. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7485.0s)]
*  To your earlier point, you need Candace to get behind me. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7486.679999999999s)]
*  Candace right now is doing a number on Ryan Reynolds. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7488.92s)]
*  She's the one saying, I think he's behind all of this. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7491.5599999999995s)]
*  He's the one driving it. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7495.4s)]
*  He was insecure. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7496.44s)]
*  He was jealous. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7497.48s)]
*  Well, to save Ryan, Blake got to take the hit. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7498.679999999999s)]
*  Yep. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7501.32s)]
*  Blake got to be like, he wasn't part of this. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7501.96s)]
*  I did this all myself. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7503.639999999999s)]
*  Maybe I misinterpreted some things. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7506.44s)]
*  Clearly, I fucked up. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7508.28s)]
*  I was in an emotional state. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7509.719999999999s)]
*  I just had a kid. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7510.679999999999s)]
*  I didn't have my fucking brain with me. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7511.64s)]
*  And Ryan was just trying to be a good supportive husband. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7513.56s)]

*  It ain't cost me $400 million. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7533.8s)]
*  But they might be able to get out of this. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7535.320000000001s)]
*  But Blake got to take the whole thing on the chin. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7537.56s)]

*  Still got to pay him. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7556.12s)]
*  They don't get less than their whole fortune. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7557.08s)]

*  This is not for us. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7573.72s)]
*  Obviously, we have no interest in this at all. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7574.52s)]
*  None. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7576.200000000001s)]
*  Obviously, it's not dominating our lives. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7576.84s)]
*  Our wives, our fiancés do not care about this at all. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7579.4800000000005s)]

*  We have more to discuss. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7594.6s)]
*  But what else do we have to discuss? [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7596.4400000000005s)]
*  You're talking about USAID being a CIA soft power [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7597.64s)]
*  in order to take over the world? [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7600.52s)]
*  When did we stop trying to take over? [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7602.76s)]
*  When did we stop being confident about taking over the world? [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7604.84s)]
*  Yeah, we got very cute about it. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7607.56s)]
*  Yeah, like, why are we embarrassed about that? [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7609.400000000001s)]
*  I think Afghanistan. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7611.400000000001s)]
*  Because we stopped being good at it. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7613.080000000001s)]
*  That might have been a good point. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7614.360000000001s)]
*  Vietnam was the one too. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7615.0s)]
*  But you're not going to take over the world [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7616.92s)]
*  by doing like trans plays in Iraq? [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7618.120000000001s)]
*  Or is that the perfect way? [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7621.96s)]
*  Is that the whole reason why we're building up [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7625.72s)]
*  the trans movement here in America? [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7627.400000000001s)]
*  Why does it destabilize? [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7631.0s)]
*  What does it do? [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7631.96s)]
*  That's what some Russian guy said. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7632.68s)]
*  You remember that clip with that Russian guy saying, [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7634.28s)]
*  like, this is how you destabilize America? [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7636.360000000001s)]
*  Is just make everything trans? [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7638.04s)]
*  Yeah, you just cause a lot of identity politics issues [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7639.24s)]
*  and stuff like that. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7641.24s)]
*  Have you ever seen that clip? [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7641.72s)]
*  You guys have seen that clip, right? [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7642.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's like a famous YouTube clip of some guy [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7644.12s)]
*  from like 25 years ago or 30 years ago being like, [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7646.2s)]
*  this is how you would cause instability in a place [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7648.360000000001s)]
*  like the US. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7650.360000000001s)]
*  You make it all internal, have them fighting about things [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7650.92s)]
*  that don't matter, like identity politics, [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7653.24s)]
*  and that would cause enough stability. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7655.32s)]
*  And then you fund the minority power, [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7656.5199999999995s)]
*  and then you create the need for American imperialism [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7658.2s)]
*  to be present in the country, [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7661.4s)]
*  because now there's this culture war that's stoked. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7662.28s)]
*  Or maybe they're just trying to help artists [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7665.24s)]
*  in a disenfranchised country. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7666.599999999999s)]
*  I feel like that might be a tool. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7668.28s)]
*  Who's to say? [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7669.4s)]
*  We'll figure it out on Patreon. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7670.36s)]
*  Yeah, we'll probably figure it out. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7671.24s)]
*  Patreon.com slash Flavor It. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HRuJ2c0uo&t=7671.96s)]
