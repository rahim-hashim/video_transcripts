*  What's up, everybody? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=0.0s)]
*  What? [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1.24s)]
*  What? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2.04s)]
*  What? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2.92s)]
*  Welcome to the show. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3.72s)]
*  Today we are joined by good friends, Netflix superstars. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5.88s)]
*  Yeah, Steve Gerby. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=9.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=11.08s)]
*  Steve Gerby and also Shane Giles, of course. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=11.88s)]
*  But Steve Gerby, I think the world has known, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=14.0s)]
*  has just hit a sub-80. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=15.84s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=17.48s)]
*  On a golf course right now. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=18.28s)]
*  Wow. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=20.2s)]
*  And I'm not saying that, like, the acting superstar [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=21.0s)]
*  has gone to his head. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=23.92s)]
*  But the sub-80, I think, might have changed something. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=24.72s)]
*  I mean, he asked Alex to not be on the couch [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=27.36s)]
*  because of the color of his skin. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=29.8s)]
*  That is true. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=31.2s)]
*  I did walk up to him on set just to say hi [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  and try to give him a hug. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  And he was like, not right now, Schultz. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=34.84s)]
*  And then he just walked away. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=36.24s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=37.24s)]
*  Not even close. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=38.16s)]
*  Because he didn't like the way I was talking to you. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=39.04s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=41.24s)]
*  He didn't like that I was being nice to you. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=42.04s)]
*  That was actually really funny. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=44.16s)]
*  You're a little suck up. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=45.44s)]
*  I'm a suck up. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=46.56s)]
*  He's talking. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=48.36s)]
*  Andrew's coming down. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=48.92s)]
*  Like, you're basically donating his time. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  So I'm just like, you know, talking to him [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=51.32s)]
*  and, like, keeping the energy up. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=53.2s)]
*  And he's like, you want to fucking be on Flay Grim. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=54.24s)]
*  I'm like, shit. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=56.68s)]
*  I'm like, just talking to him. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=58.48s)]
*  He didn't even say that. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=60.919999999999995s)]
*  It just walks up. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=62.4s)]
*  I didn't say you want to be on Flay Grim. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=63.4s)]
*  For whatever it was called. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=65.39999999999999s)]
*  I'm like, what does it say? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=66.88s)]
*  So he just walks up. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=67.88s)]
*  He's kind of hulking. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=68.67999999999999s)]
*  He goes, stop it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=69.56s)]
*  Just walks away. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=71.88s)]
*  You should have seen him with Thomas Hayden [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=73.44s)]
*  Church on this season. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=75.36s)]
*  Just, like, agreeable. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=77.44s)]
*  You know, I would say that's the way that I would describe it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=79.08s)]
*  And so, you know, you just kind of use social grease [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=81.8s)]
*  and what have you. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=84.16s)]
*  You know, you say, you know, you just kind of go along with it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=84.72s)]
*  And he just doesn't like it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=86.84s)]
*  I don't know what you're talking about. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=87.96s)]
*  So how are you doing, Andy? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=89.6s)]
*  I did this with Zlatan Ibrahimovic. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=93.44s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=96.44s)]
*  We met him in Abu Dhabi. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=97.16s)]
*  He's a soccer player, all time legend, one of the greats. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=98.72s)]
*  And I just saw him. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=101.6s)]
*  And it was one of the few times I [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=102.96s)]
*  spazzed out seeing a famous person. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=104.19999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=105.91999999999999s)]
*  Like, normally, I just avoid it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  And then it just goes away. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=107.52s)]
*  But I just couldn't help it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=108.83999999999999s)]
*  I was like, I have to get a picture with Zlatan. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=110.03999999999999s)]
*  So I dapped him up. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=111.83999999999999s)]
*  And I was like, dude, I love you. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=112.63999999999999s)]
*  I think I said I love him to Zlatan. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  And he was like, OK. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=116.24s)]
*  And then I took a selfie. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=117.56s)]
*  And then I never saw him again. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=118.36s)]
*  He just walked away. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=119.36s)]
*  It was awful. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=120.0s)]
*  It was terrible. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  Hey, you got a selfie. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=121.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  I was starstruck. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=123.08s)]
*  Caitlin Clark was at my show in Indiana. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=124.64s)]
*  And I had, for some reason, I was like, oh, shit. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=127.96s)]
*  Every once in a while, somebody gets me that I didn't think [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=132.64s)]
*  was going to make it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=134.72s)]
*  There's a clip of you saying hi to Steph Curry [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=135.32s)]
*  and introducing yourself and him going, I know who you are. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=138.44s)]
*  Yeah, that was awesome. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=140.51999999999998s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=141.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=141.92s)]
*  I mean, that's awesome. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=142.16s)]
*  Which was funny, too, because it was me and Sam Jay. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=142.76s)]
*  You were at the Knicks game. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=145.28s)]
*  And the whole time, I'm sitting there, I'm like, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  I hate the Warriors, the Warriors. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=149.12s)]
*  Draymond Green's a sucker, him. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=151.2s)]
*  But our seat was right next to the bench. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=153.2s)]
*  And Draymond was sitting next to us. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=154.64s)]
*  And he was funny. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=157.16s)]
*  And he was the man. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=157.96s)]
*  And I was like, damn, I was wrong about Draymond. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=158.72s)]
*  And then I'm Steph Curry's edge. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  And then he looks over at Sam Jay because he knew Sam. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=163.24s)]
*  And he was like, what's up? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=165.24s)]
*  Immediately, she and I were both like, dude, Steph Curry's [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=166.48s)]
*  awesome. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=168.28s)]
*  He's so awesome. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=169.8s)]
*  Even just as a fan, I rooted for him one time in the Olympics. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=172.0s)]
*  And I was like, oh, I get why Golden State's [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=174.68s)]
*  fans are the worst. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=176.8s)]
*  He's incredible. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  It's the most fun you can ever have. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=178.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=179.64000000000001s)]
*  That was back when I liked the Knicks. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=180.88000000000002s)]
*  That was last season. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=183.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=184.52s)]
*  Why don't you like them now? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=185.0s)]
*  Last year, when they eliminated Philly. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=186.32000000000002s)]
*  You guys were in the playoffs last year? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=190.8s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=191.36s)]
*  Remember it was one of those series you guys won [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=192.8s)]
*  and acted like you won the Super Bowl? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=194.60000000000002s)]
*  You won one series? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=197.0s)]
*  Every series. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=197.88000000000002s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  I was trying to cheer for you guys. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=200.44s)]
*  You're such cocksuckers. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=201.8s)]
*  Somebody else said that, too. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=202.68s)]
*  It is tough, dude. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=203.8s)]
*  I want to. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=204.8s)]
*  We just get so overexcited about it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=205.44s)]

*  What were you going to say, though, Kerry? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=548.52s)]
*  No, I was just going to say it was very... like season one especially was so cool because he... [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=550.52s)]
*  I don't know how much people know, but that... [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=554.52s)]
*  He paid to have that entire shot made to shoot the entire thing. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=556.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=560.52s)]
*  And that was when his star was sort of rising and he should have not done that. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=562.52s)]
*  I just knew you were a star. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=566.52s)]
*  No. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=570.52s)]
*  I knew from day one. He's like a Tom Cruise. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=572.52s)]
*  You're like the next Tom Cruise. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=574.52s)]
*  Stop. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=576.52s)]
*  I'm being serious, though. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=578.52s)]
*  Anyway, it's just a special thing you did. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=580.52s)]
*  Just take the compliment, Shane. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=582.52s)]
*  No, it's also... it's McKeever that's... [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=584.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=586.52s)]
*  It's all McKeever. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=588.52s)]
*  And Gerby, baby. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=590.52s)]
*  Maybe it's all three of you guys. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=592.52s)]
*  True, but the work he does is... [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=594.52s)]
*  McKeever is like... [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=596.52s)]
*  I think you guys are all... [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=598.52s)]
*  McKeever is absolutely amazing. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=600.52s)]
*  I just had the season and then I just forget about it. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=602.52s)]
*  I just go... like all I did was act. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=604.52s)]
*  And then I'll call... [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=606.52s)]
*  You're selling yourself short. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=608.52s)]
*  I'll call McKeever like two months later. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=610.52s)]
*  You were very involved in scenes. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=612.52s)]
*  I called McKeever like two or three months later and I was like, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=614.52s)]
*  what's up, dude? What have you been up to? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=616.52s)]
*  I've been editing. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=618.52s)]
*  I haven't left. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=620.52s)]
*  I was like, oh shit, you're still working on that? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=622.52s)]
*  I forgot about that. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=624.52s)]
*  Who is the craziest person in the season that you got to cameo? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=626.52s)]
*  And how did you ask them? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=628.52s)]
*  It was Vince Vaughn, for sure. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=630.52s)]
*  And what was the ask? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=632.52s)]
*  I met him a couple of times and he and I... [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=634.52s)]
*  I was in a movie that he was in that hasn't come out yet. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=636.52s)]
*  But we got to know each other and he's the coolest fucking guy ever. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=638.52s)]
*  He seems awesome. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=642.52s)]
*  He is Vince Vaughn, which is... [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=644.52s)]
*  He's like that all the time. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=646.52s)]
*  He's the guy from Swingers basically. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=648.52s)]
*  Do you know the new movie? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=650.52s)]
*  No, I haven't seen it yet. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=652.52s)]
*  We went to see the internship together. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=654.52s)]
*  He's the man. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=656.52s)]
*  He's kind of the coolest guy ever. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=658.52s)]
*  You reach out personally? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=660.52s)]
*  I just texted him and I was like, would you be in the show we're making? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=662.52s)]
*  And he was like, yeah, of course. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=664.52s)]
*  He was familiar with season one? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=666.52s)]
*  I don't know if he had even seen it yet. I'm not sure. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=668.52s)]
*  But he just instantly was like, yeah, just say when. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=670.52s)]
*  And then we were trying to find a way to get him in the show. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=672.52s)]
*  Because we got Vince Vaughn. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=676.52s)]
*  And then we kind of shoehorn him in there. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=678.52s)]
*  So you'll see. He's in two scenes. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=682.52s)]
*  So you're writing for Vince Vaughn, right? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=684.52s)]
*  And you've seen every Vince Vaughn movie, right? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=686.52s)]
*  Oh, man, that's a great topic. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=688.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=690.52s)]
*  How do you stop yourself from just writing... [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=692.52s)]
*  We didn't. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=694.52s)]
*  He wrote... [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=696.52s)]
*  He had a pass at the script. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=698.52s)]
*  Do you remember that? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=700.52s)]
*  Every sentence ended with baby. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=702.52s)]
*  Oh. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=704.52s)]
*  I mean, the times, baby. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=706.52s)]
*  Look at these times, baby. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=708.52s)]
*  Come on, baby. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=710.52s)]
*  So you get Vince in. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=712.52s)]
*  And then he's in these scenes. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=714.52s)]
*  And you've obviously worked the script to respect him as an actor. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=716.52s)]
*  And not make him... [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=720.52s)]
*  He got the lines right away. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=722.52s)]
*  I think we gave him to him that day. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=724.52s)]
*  And he just knew him. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=726.52s)]
*  It was pretty impressive. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=728.52s)]
*  And then he added Vince stuff. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=730.52s)]
*  Which was awesome to watch. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=732.52s)]
*  Were you intimidated when you're... [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=734.52s)]
*  A little, yeah. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=736.52s)]
*  Especially because our scene is just me and him sitting at the bar. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=738.52s)]
*  And it's like, oh, shit. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=740.52s)]
*  And he would improv and say just... [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=742.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=744.52s)]
*  We'd finish the scene and be like, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=746.52s)]
*  What are your thoughts on Japanese toys on a scale of two to four? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=748.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=750.52s)]
*  Three? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=752.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=754.52s)]
*  He's not at all intimidated doing comedy with you. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=756.52s)]
*  No. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=758.52s)]
*  It's interesting, right? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=760.52s)]
*  I mean, just as a comedic actor, he's like Hall of Fame. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=762.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=764.52s)]
*  Of course, of course, of course. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=766.52s)]
*  You're around a comedian, you might pull your punches a little bit more. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=768.52s)]
*  But he's just so confident in his shit. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=770.52s)]
*  He doesn't care. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=772.52s)]
*  Yeah, he was like a real actor. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=774.52s)]
*  Yeah, he is. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=776.52s)]
*  He was like serious. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=778.52s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=780.52s)]
*  Yeah, he's a real fucking actor. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=782.52s)]
*  He's like a thespian. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=784.52s)]
*  When you riffed, would he like... [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=786.52s)]
*  Well, yeah, Gherby is obviously. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=788.52s)]
*  Gherby is just wearing a robe in his trailer. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=790.52s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=792.52s)]
*  One time. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=794.52s)]

*  Has there been anything cool that you've been able to do? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=862.52s)]
*  Just a little bit of financial freedom, which is an unbelievable feeling. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=864.52s)]
*  Massive, right? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=866.52s)]

*  I joined the country club. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=872.52s)]
*  I joined the Jewish country club. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=874.52s)]
*  You joined the Jewish country club? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=876.52s)]
*  Technically, not anymore. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=878.52s)]
*  Yeah, it was Palestinian. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=880.52s)]
*  It was not Jewish? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=882.52s)]
*  No, they got bought by a conglomerate. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=884.52s)]
*  Because they apparently ran it into the ground financially. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=886.52s)]
*  Because they apparently ran it into the ground financially. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=888.52s)]
*  Because they apparently ran it into the ground financially. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=890.52s)]
*  They were skimming off the top of it. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=892.52s)]
*  No, I don't know. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=894.52s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=896.52s)]
*  Because there was a very expensive shed, apparently. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=898.52s)]
*  Who knows? But anyway, that's what I did with it. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=900.52s)]
*  So you got into the country club. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=902.52s)]
*  And then now you've been hanging out, you're playing a lot of golf, and it hasn't affected Shane at all. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=904.52s)]
*  And then now you've been hanging out, you're playing a lot of golf, and it hasn't affected Shane at all. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=906.52s)]
*  Shane is not bummed at all that you guys don't have time. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=908.52s)]
*  He doesn't. Well, obviously he doesn't like me. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=910.52s)]
*  Why do you think that is? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=912.52s)]
*  Because you guys have such great chemistry. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=914.52s)]
*  You're so nice to him. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=916.52s)]
*  You're always defending him. Why don't you love this guy? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=918.52s)]
*  I love you! [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=920.52s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=922.52s)]
*  You are exhausting, though. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=924.52s)]
*  It's like I love you, but then you go away. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=926.52s)]
*  It's like I love you, but then you go away. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=928.52s)]
*  Hey, buddy, I can relate. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=930.52s)]
*  Hey, buddy, I can relate. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=932.52s)]
*  Wait, why is he so exhausting? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=934.52s)]
*  Wait, why is he so exhausting? What does he do? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=936.52s)]
*  I mean, you saw what it is. I can't do anything. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=938.52s)]
*  The amount of time that I thought I was like, should I tuck in? I had a whole outfit. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=942.52s)]
*  I was writing a tissue for Mark on my head. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=948.52s)]
*  I couldn't do it. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=950.52s)]
*  Because you're worried what he's going to say the second he sees it. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=952.52s)]
*  Of course. I'm walking around. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=954.52s)]
*  You said like that clip that's going out. Sorry, I'm ignoring you. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=956.52s)]

*  That's awesome. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=962.52s)]
*  Where it's like, you know, he had guys film him. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=964.52s)]
*  I've been walking around my house, be like, you have guys film you. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=966.52s)]
*  What? I don't have guys film me? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=970.52s)]
*  You do. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=972.52s)]
*  If somebody's filming me, I go, please stop filming me. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=974.52s)]
*  No, you're podcast. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=976.52s)]
*  That doesn't fucking count. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=980.52s)]
*  Well, anyway, that's what he does. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=982.52s)]
*  It's just so, everything is like, how is Shane going to respond to this and whatever. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=984.52s)]
*  This is crazy. You see what I mean? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=988.52s)]
*  No. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=990.52s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=992.52s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=994.52s)]
*  See what I mean? He doesn't like it. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=996.52s)]
*  He doesn't like me judging everything he does. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=998.52s)]
*  What the fuck is wrong with this guy? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1000.52s)]
*  Psychological warfare. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1002.52s)]
*  We're doing a late night tomorrow. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1004.52s)]
*  And I called him and I was like, well, you got your tuxedo, right? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1006.52s)]
*  We're going to wear tuxedos. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1010.52s)]
*  And then he called me like. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1012.52s)]
*  Well, because originally he texted you. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1014.52s)]
*  He did text and he was like. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1016.52s)]
*  I wanted him to wear a tuxedo. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1018.52s)]
*  I'm not wearing a fucking tuxedo. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1020.52s)]
*  So I ordered one. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1022.52s)]
*  And then before I took it to the tailor. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1024.52s)]
*  Because the praying man's body, I had like the shoulders telling him to take it. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1026.52s)]
*  And I was like, are we really doing this? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1030.52s)]
*  And then he. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1032.52s)]
*  I had a moment of weakness. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1034.52s)]
*  I was like, no, we're not. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1036.52s)]
*  I felt bad. I was going to make him wear a tuxedo. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1038.52s)]
*  That was beautiful. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1040.52s)]
*  But I know Steve, he wants to wear a tuxedo. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1042.52s)]
*  I mean, not a tux, but like a suit shirt. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1044.52s)]
*  You know what would be great is if you show up tomorrow with a fucking tuxedo. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1046.52s)]
*  That's good writing. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1050.52s)]
*  That's good writing. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1052.52s)]

*  That's good stuff. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1056.52s)]
*  That's good writing. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1058.52s)]
*  Shane. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1060.52s)]
*  But then he did have another funny. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1062.52s)]
*  You don't think he's already thought of that? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1064.52s)]
*  I had another idea. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1066.52s)]
*  His other idea is very funny because. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1068.52s)]
*  You can go ahead. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1070.52s)]
*  He apparently in an auction. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1072.52s)]
*  Purchased OJ Simpson's ties. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1074.52s)]
*  So he's going to be like. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1076.52s)]
*  He's going to be like, all right, just wear a suit and then ask me to wear this. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1078.52s)]
*  Find out live. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1082.52s)]
*  I'm already like, I got a ton of anxiety about just the general thing. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1084.52s)]
*  I thought that would have been kind of. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1088.52s)]
*  That would have been good. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1090.52s)]
*  It would have been so viral. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1092.52s)]
*  Classic moment. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1094.52s)]
*  He comes out in a tux, your dress like this. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1096.52s)]
*  And then you don't even let anybody. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1098.52s)]
*  You just let the internet figure it out on its own. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1100.52s)]
*  So. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1102.52s)]
*  It's going to be a disaster. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1104.52s)]
*  So what do you guys want? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1106.52s)]

*  I didn't pack. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1116.52s)]
*  There was a storm in Texas and I have no power. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1118.52s)]
*  And I have to be gone. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1120.52s)]
*  I've been on the road for like a week. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1122.52s)]
*  It's terrible. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1124.52s)]
*  And I was going to do laundry before I left for this trip. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1126.52s)]
*  But everything. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1128.52s)]

*  was sitting in the shower just covered in muck. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1446.52s)]
*  And then I had to shower [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1448.52s)]
*  in the same shower that I just cleaned. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=1450.52s)]

*  Yeah, and I was thinking it through. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2294.52s)]
*  What if they contact... [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2296.52s)]
*  Were you living in like a living room? [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2298.52s)]
*  I was in a dining room. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2300.52s)]
*  Because I was running... [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2302.52s)]
*  Jacked up in a dining room. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2304.52s)]
*  So I just had curtains hung up. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2306.52s)]
*  And then you went home, right? [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2308.52s)]
*  Didn't you move home? [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2310.52s)]
*  Well, after internship, of course I went home. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2312.52s)]
*  It was a blow up mattress. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2314.52s)]
*  I thought it was for comedy that you wrote. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2316.52s)]
*  No, it was internship. I tried to do comedy. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2318.52s)]
*  You tried... [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2320.52s)]
*  Stand-up? You weren't good at stand-up. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2322.52s)]
*  He is really good. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2324.52s)]
*  But 18 years ago, none of us were good. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2326.52s)]
*  He's really good. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2328.52s)]
*  I believe that. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2330.52s)]
*  I met McKeever. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2332.52s)]
*  So basically, like the story... [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2334.52s)]
*  McKeever and I came up at the same time. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2336.52s)]
*  He is... [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2338.52s)]
*  He truly is fantastic. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2340.52s)]
*  And he just... [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2342.52s)]
*  Which is cool. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2344.52s)]
*  And then I got seen [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2346.52s)]
*  and they said, you got to come to New York. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2348.52s)]
*  So I moved to New York. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2350.52s)]
*  Failed. When I came back, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2352.52s)]
*  I was like very sad. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2354.52s)]
*  And John McKeever would [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2356.52s)]
*  still continue to put me in everything. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2358.52s)]
*  But that was when he was like, have you heard of Shane Gillis? [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2360.52s)]
*  And I was like, no. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2362.52s)]
*  And he was like, he's the funniest guy I've ever seen. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2364.52s)]
*  You guys have to do something together. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2366.52s)]
*  So you come into the scene. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2368.52s)]
*  You're a few years younger than him. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2370.52s)]
*  You come into the scene while you're in New York. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2372.52s)]
*  He had... [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2374.52s)]
*  He had like about to stop doing it. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2376.52s)]
*  And what about McKeever? [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2378.52s)]
*  McKeever stopped [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2380.52s)]
*  kind of right when I got there. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2382.52s)]
*  Which that was crazy. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2384.52s)]
*  He is just that good. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2386.52s)]
*  He won't do stand-up for like two years. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2388.52s)]
*  He'll come to a spot and he'll just murder. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2390.52s)]
*  Is he like a tortured artist? [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2392.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2394.52s)]
*  I think he just likes... [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2396.52s)]
*  I shouldn't talk about him. He's not here. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2398.52s)]
*  But I think he's very good at [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2400.52s)]
*  writing, directing. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2402.52s)]
*  He just... he wants to focus there. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2404.52s)]
*  That's great. I've never gotten to meet him so I'm just asking. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2406.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2408.52s)]
*  That's very normal. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2410.52s)]
*  He's a regular fucking guy. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2412.52s)]
*  And really great on set. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2414.52s)]
*  And the sketches, I've seen him and he's terrible. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2416.52s)]
*  And he's a really good actor. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2418.52s)]
*  He's probably the best of us. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2420.52s)]
*  He's fantastic. But I want to learn some [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2422.52s)]
*  lore for all you guys. So you're coming into the scene. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2424.52s)]
*  Are you aware of these guys at the time? [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2426.52s)]
*  I didn't know Gerben. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2428.52s)]
*  But I had heard about him. They all told me he was great. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2430.52s)]
*  I was obsessed with [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2432.52s)]

*  before we met. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2456.52s)]
*  And then we actually met. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2458.52s)]
*  And then we deleted the DM. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2460.52s)]
*  Smart. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2462.52s)]
*  He's eventually going to send me something. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2464.52s)]
*  I don't want to see me being a loser. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2466.52s)]

*  I miss New York. And I was like... [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2658.52s)]
*  There was one week when I knew I was getting SNL. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2660.52s)]
*  And no one else knew. And I was just walking around [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2662.52s)]
*  the city like... [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2664.52s)]
*  What a beautiful fucking city. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2666.52s)]
*  A fucking dream. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2668.52s)]
*  This is incredible. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2670.52s)]
*  And then the next week I got fired and I was walking around like... [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2672.52s)]
*  Fucking hate this city. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2674.52s)]
*  Fucking everyone here sucks. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2676.52s)]
*  How soon after when we were at JFL together? [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2678.52s)]
*  That was it. That was when I got SNL. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2680.52s)]
*  Okay. Now, when we were at the [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2682.52s)]
*  Chinese restaurant, did you already know? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2684.52s)]
*  No. It was from that night. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2686.52s)]
*  I remember. You had a set and you... [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2688.52s)]
*  And you're very... [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2690.52s)]
*  Usually you just say you bomb all the time. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2692.52s)]
*  Which is hard to believe. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2694.52s)]
*  But I think this one... [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2696.52s)]
*  That's funny. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2698.52s)]
*  Which is... I think this one you were like... [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2700.52s)]
*  No, I think I did pretty good. Like you felt good about it. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2702.52s)]
*  Yeah, I did good there. And I ran the light. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2704.52s)]
*  And I looked over to Jeff Singer and I was like... [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2706.52s)]
*  Am I good to run it? And he was like... [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2708.52s)]
*  Oh, he said keep going. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2710.52s)]
*  That's huge. Yeah, that was cool. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2712.52s)]
*  Okay, so you find out the next day? [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2714.52s)]
*  No, no. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2716.52s)]
*  They were just there. They had seen it. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2718.52s)]
*  It was from that set that they hired me. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2720.52s)]
*  But... [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2722.52s)]
*  No, I didn't find out. I don't think for a little while. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2724.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2726.52s)]
*  Yeah, but that was 2019 and... [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2728.52s)]
*  Yeah. I forget what I'm saying. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2730.52s)]
*  I'm trying to get the lore. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2732.52s)]
*  And how all you guys are still connected. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2734.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2736.52s)]
*  So we had made tires as like a... [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2738.52s)]
*  You know, short. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2740.52s)]
*  Yeah. When was this? Sorry. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2742.52s)]
*  Oh yeah, we made tires like a long time ago. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2744.52s)]
*  Yeah, like 2016, 17, somewhere around there. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2746.52s)]
*  And the first time we just shot TestFood, [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2748.52s)]
*  I think that was our first time like really hanging out. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2750.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2752.52s)]
*  And he was phenomenal. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2754.52s)]
*  And then... [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2756.52s)]
*  I wonder how nice I was to you. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2758.52s)]
*  You were pantsing me. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2760.52s)]
*  I had a little... [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2762.52s)]
*  Day one of meeting him. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2764.52s)]
*  He's been missed. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2766.52s)]
*  He's been missed. Forever. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2768.52s)]
*  I paid him. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2770.52s)]
*  I paid him to be in the show. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2772.52s)]
*  And he was torturing me. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2774.52s)]
*  And then... [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2776.52s)]
*  Yeah, it was like overdrafting Chipotle charges at that time. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2778.52s)]
*  And just being a mess. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2780.52s)]
*  But he was so funny. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2782.52s)]
*  I had zero dollars. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2784.52s)]
*  I was fucked. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2786.52s)]
*  And so like the first time we shot TestFood, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2788.52s)]
*  because we would only have it for a Sunday. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2790.52s)]
*  So we would try and shoot like 8 or 10 pages in a Sunday. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2792.52s)]
*  We'd like get in there as quick as we could. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2794.52s)]
*  And then we almost got it. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2796.52s)]
*  And then we shot it another time. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2798.52s)]
*  And then the third time is what ended up being online for a while. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2800.52s)]
*  Which was really fun. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2804.52s)]
*  And then after that was Gillian Keeves, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2806.52s)]
*  which you helped out a lot. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2808.52s)]
*  I don't know if I did anything for him. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2810.52s)]
*  Oh, you did. We probably wouldn't have made it. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2812.52s)]
*  Well, I appreciate that. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2814.52s)]
*  Yeah, it was nice. Thank you. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2816.52s)]
*  Because John wasn't totally listening to me. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2818.52s)]
*  And I was like, he's going to listen to Schultz. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2820.52s)]
*  You've shown the model. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2822.52s)]
*  I think you guys needed to get on board for that. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2824.52s)]
*  I feel like they were a little hesitant or something. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2826.52s)]
*  Everyone was pretty hesitant. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2828.52s)]
*  I remember I saw a sketch. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2830.52s)]
*  I knew it was going to work. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2832.52s)]
*  Fuck. I remember I saw a sketch. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2834.52s)]
*  I forget even which one, but I remember I hit you up immediately after. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2836.52s)]
*  And I was like, this is the funniest shit that I've ever seen. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2838.52s)]
*  It was just unbelievable. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2840.52s)]
*  And it was so different. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2842.52s)]
*  I think there was like a lot of sketch on ISIS Toyo. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2844.52s)]
*  But I don't think that was the one. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2846.52s)]
*  I think it was something else. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2848.52s)]
*  Anyway, and I hit you up, I was like, this is the funniest fucking shit. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2850.52s)]
*  You're like, yeah, I think we're trying to, you're like, I want to make a season. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2852.52s)]
*  I want to like put this thing together. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2854.52s)]
*  I'm trying to convince these guys. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2856.52s)]
*  This was during COVID actually. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2858.52s)]
*  Because we were in Miami. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2860.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2862.52s)]
*  And then you released your special too at that time. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2864.52s)]
*  Has that been wild to see what's happened with his career? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2866.52s)]
*  Of course. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2868.52s)]
*  Do you go to the arena shows? [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2870.52s)]
*  Is it like put things in perspective? [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2872.52s)]
*  It doesn't. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2874.52s)]
*  We know how good he is. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2876.52s)]
*  So it's not like a shock to, but it is a shock to me. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2878.52s)]
*  It's not like a shock to, but it is still weird. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2880.52s)]
*  But it's also like, I mean, I get a bite. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2882.52s)]
*  But he's my favorite comic. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2884.52s)]
*  Don't be good. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2886.52s)]
*  I mean, he's so funny. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2888.52s)]
*  And so it's not like super like, you're not surprised by the success. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2890.52s)]
*  It's the same that anyone is doing. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2892.52s)]
*  But it's wild to see. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2894.52s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2896.52s)]
*  But I remember the first time I saw you, because McKeever had sent me your Ted Talk. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2898.52s)]
*  Because that was a crazy thing. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2900.52s)]
*  I remember that. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2902.52s)]
*  I remember that. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2904.52s)]
*  I remember that. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2906.52s)]
*  I remember the first time I saw you, because McKeever had sent me your Ted Talk. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2908.52s)]
*  Because that was during... [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2910.52s)]
*  But no, that's a really good talk. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2912.52s)]
*  Especially like, just like he said, [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2914.52s)]
*  this was the time, 2015, 2016, [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2916.52s)]
*  where it was like, yeah, you're going to have to find a different way. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2918.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2920.52s)]
*  God damn, the whites. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2922.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2924.52s)]
*  We'll find a way. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2926.52s)]
*  The industry was like, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2928.52s)]
*  you can't be white. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2930.52s)]
*  We're like, well, now the industry's dead. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2932.52s)]
*  Just like that. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2934.52s)]
*  Just like that. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2936.52s)]
*  Let that be a lesson for you. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2938.52s)]
*  We're going to decide who the next president is. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2940.52s)]
*  I mean, you got to see Shane [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2944.52s)]
*  throw a first pitch at a baseball game. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2946.52s)]
*  You must have been so excited for him. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2948.52s)]
*  Of course I was excited. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2950.52s)]
*  Massive little fuck, dude. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2952.52s)]
*  You wanted me to fall down. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2954.52s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2956.52s)]
*  You wanted him to fail. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2958.52s)]
*  What was the first thing you said when he came back up after... [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2960.52s)]
*  I don't recall. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2962.52s)]
*  After throwing a perfect strike, what was the first thing you said? [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2964.52s)]
*  From the mound? You threw a perfect strike? [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2966.52s)]
*  I don't get, like, excited. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2968.52s)]
*  What did he say? [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2970.52s)]
*  I was like, it was not perfect. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2972.52s)]
*  I'm just kidding. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2974.52s)]
*  It's just joking. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2976.52s)]
*  At certain angles it looks pretty good. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2978.52s)]
*  At other angles it looks terrible. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2980.52s)]
*  It's like an awful pitch. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2982.52s)]
*  I usually don't get, like, [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2984.52s)]
*  excited or proud [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2986.52s)]
*  of a lot of the things I do. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2988.52s)]
*  But that time, like, I was like, [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2990.52s)]
*  that was such a relief. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2992.52s)]
*  That was the most nerve-wracking thing I've ever done. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2994.52s)]
*  I was standing on the mound like, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2996.52s)]
*  oh, don't fuck this up. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=2998.52s)]
*  And I was like, proud of myself. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3000.52s)]
*  I have a video of it, it's very funny. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3002.52s)]
*  I get done throwing it and I'm like, [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3004.52s)]
*  let's watch it. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3006.52s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3008.52s)]
*  Gervs. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3010.52s)]
*  Gervs, nasty ass. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3012.52s)]
*  This is on MLB.com. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3014.52s)]
*  See, I'm telling you, it was a great fucking drill. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3016.52s)]
*  It's still up there, bro. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3018.52s)]
*  It does have very good form. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3020.52s)]
*  Pack Stadium. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3022.52s)]
*  Well, I didn't know we were going to watch the video. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3024.52s)]
*  It wasn't a good pitch. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3026.52s)]
*  I'm not standing by this. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3028.52s)]
*  I didn't know you were that nervous. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3032.52s)]
*  I remember this exact moment. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3034.52s)]
*  Oh, dude, I can't imagine how nervous you were. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3036.52s)]
*  If you go back to that, I... [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3038.52s)]
*  Because every bad first pitch lives online forever. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3040.52s)]
*  I reached for a high five to the fanatic [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3042.52s)]
*  and he was high-fiving my nephew. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3044.52s)]
*  On the walkout, I was like, [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3046.52s)]
*  I'm going to go to the fan. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3048.52s)]
*  That's not a great way to start. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3050.52s)]
*  What was the documentary where they included... [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3052.52s)]
*  Was it on 9-11 or something where they included [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3054.52s)]
*  George Bush's opening pitch? [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3056.52s)]
*  Oh, that's just so nice. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3058.52s)]
*  That's one of America's greatest moments. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3060.52s)]
*  That was up there. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3062.52s)]
*  Fucking heater. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3064.52s)]
*  In New York, a strike just going... [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3066.52s)]
*  It's all time. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3068.52s)]
*  What was it part of? [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3070.52s)]
*  Osama threw out a first pitch? [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3072.52s)]
*  And a second one. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3074.52s)]
*  And a ball. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3076.52s)]
*  A couple balls in the Somerset. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3078.52s)]
*  Paint to the corner of the Pentagon corner. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3082.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3086.52s)]
*  Are we not getting that video up? [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3088.52s)]
*  We got some technical difficulties. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3090.52s)]
*  It's okay. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3092.52s)]
*  Yeah, we need a producer tag right here, though. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3094.52s)]
*  Miles made himself producer tags. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3096.52s)]
*  Miles, please. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3098.52s)]
*  I wasn't ready. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3100.52s)]
*  You didn't know you were working? [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3102.52s)]
*  I'm going to use the bathroom. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3104.52s)]
*  Go, go, go. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3106.52s)]
*  Alright, guys, let's take a break for a second. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3108.52s)]
*  We got to talk about this Knicks tragedy. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3110.52s)]
*  Yeah, it was a tragedy, man. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3112.52s)]
*  It was tough. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3114.52s)]
*  I mean, going into the half, it was tied. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3116.52s)]
*  I think we were tied to half. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3118.52s)]
*  I was like, were we down one or something like that? [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3120.52s)]
*  It was close. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3122.52s)]
*  Down four. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3124.52s)]
*  But it was close. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3126.52s)]
*  It was competitive. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3128.52s)]
*  And then they came out in the third and it was just unbelievable. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3130.52s)]
*  I remember it was 15 and then y'all got it down to like seven or eight or something, maybe nine. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3132.52s)]
*  And I was like, oh, okay. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3136.52s)]
*  A little momentum. Just quick. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3138.52s)]
*  Yeah, you just can't play. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3140.52s)]
*  It just felt like we didn't have enough strategy offensively or defensively. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3142.52s)]
*  They ran this double pick and roll whenever Brunson was in the game. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3146.52s)]
*  And within seconds, Brunson is guarding the biggest guy on their team. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3150.52s)]
*  We had no kind of plan for it. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3154.52s)]
*  And apparently, if Kat and Brunson are in the game, [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3156.52s)]
*  Kat can't show what you see a lot of times in pick and roll where the big kind of steps out and then fades back so that the guy can't slide under it. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3160.52s)]
*  But apparently they don't know if he's fast enough to do that or whatever. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3168.52s)]
*  But they just did an amazing job of exposing our two most prolific players. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3172.52s)]
*  There's no question that Brunson and Kat are prolific. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3176.52s)]
*  But their lack of defensive ability against this team who's guarding you 94 feet, it was unbelievable. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3180.52s)]
*  It was unbelievable. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3186.52s)]
*  There was times during the game where they were locking down on D and the whole place going, D, fans are chanting. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3188.52s)]
*  And it was mesmerizing. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3192.52s)]
*  We were playing scared. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3194.52s)]
*  We were playing scared. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3196.52s)]
*  We weren't helping out. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3198.52s)]
*  They would double team Jaylen. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3200.52s)]
*  The leakouts this series, I haven't watched them much this year, but I was amazed at how many leakouts there were. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3202.52s)]
*  And then just cuts to the basket that were wide open layups. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3206.52s)]
*  Great finds. A lot of times by Halliburton or whatever. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3210.52s)]
*  It was lost on D. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3212.52s)]
*  This is supposed to be a D guy. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3214.52s)]
*  Listen, he did a great job with the team. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3216.52s)]
*  I do believe in the team. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3218.52s)]
*  Mitchell Robinson played phenomenal. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3220.52s)]
*  His ability to crash offensive boards, cause chaos was great. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3222.52s)]
*  But we got out-strategized here. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3226.52s)]
*  If we're going to go back with this same team, it's got to be... [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3230.52s)]
*  We just have to acknowledge what's going on. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3234.52s)]
*  Jaylen is unstoppable offensively. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3236.52s)]
*  He's one of the most amazing offensive players we've ever seen. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3238.52s)]
*  But when he's on the floor, if there aren't four amazing defenders with him, it can be exposed. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3240.52s)]
*  And it was. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3248.52s)]
*  And when he was off the floor, you saw us hold leads. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3250.52s)]
*  You saw us, at times, make comebacks. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3252.52s)]
*  It's cause we could actually lock up and defend. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3256.52s)]
*  But unfortunately, when we had those defensive teams in there, they didn't have the firepower. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3258.52s)]
*  If that first game goes the other way. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3262.52s)]
*  I was going to say, if that Halliburton thing doesn't bounce in, crazy bounce. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3264.52s)]
*  I want to say that it would have been different, but you've got to give credit to the Pacers. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3268.52s)]
*  They're a better team. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3272.52s)]
*  They figured it out. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3274.52s)]
*  We didn't make adjustments. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3276.52s)]
*  This is the first time I've ever watched the next Lose game, and I thought the rest were on our side. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3278.52s)]
*  I'm there in the arena, and I'm watching the game get called, going, are we getting some calls here? [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3282.52s)]
*  Did it feel that way when you're watching at home? [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3288.52s)]
*  You've got to give credit to the Pacers, man. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3290.52s)]
*  I was like, there were times where I wanted to call and I was like, no, they got that right. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3292.52s)]
*  Do you think Pacers take it in the final? [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3298.52s)]
*  I don't. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3300.52s)]
*  It's going to be interesting. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3302.52s)]
*  I haven't watched much this year, cause Luca, that trade broke me. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3304.52s)]
*  But Oklahoma City, when I watch them in the playoffs, the defense is just like, unfucking, this is locked down. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3308.52s)]
*  Nobody's beating that team. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3312.52s)]

*  I mean, it would be nice as a consolation prize to lose to the winners. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3316.52s)]
*  I would love it, yeah. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3320.52s)]

*  What is this? [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3354.52s)]
*  It's a skylight. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3356.52s)]
*  Is that like made or is this part of it? [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3358.52s)]
*  No, the sky's up there. That's what the sky looks like. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3360.52s)]
*  If you open that, you would just go to the sky. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3362.52s)]

*  Yeah, you like that. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3368.52s)]
*  Where are the lights? [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3370.52s)]
*  No, there's a perfect amount of light today. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3372.52s)]
*  Were you outside ever? [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3374.52s)]
*  I was outside. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3376.52s)]
*  As a matter of fact, I think it's starting to get a little late. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3378.52s)]
*  I'll tell you why. That was pretty awesome. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3380.52s)]

*  Yeah, depending on the guest. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3418.52s)]
*  Miles made this fucking podcast. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3420.52s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3424.52s)]
*  How has no one else done this yet? [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3426.52s)]
*  I don't know, but it's fantastic. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3428.52s)]
*  It's so obvious. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3430.52s)]

*  The cannon. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3438.52s)]
*  Damn, son. Where did you find this? [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3440.52s)]
*  You ready for that one? [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3442.52s)]
*  If you say my name, I'll put it in the next producer tag. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3444.52s)]
*  You say Miles, and I'll just... [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3446.52s)]
*  Miles. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3448.52s)]
*  That's a banger. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3452.52s)]
*  Unfortunately, that's a banger. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3454.52s)]
*  It's going to be awesome. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3456.52s)]
*  Miles. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3458.52s)]
*  Okay, we're back. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3460.52s)]
*  Are you... [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3464.52s)]
*  How do you keep writing new jokes? [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3466.52s)]
*  I haven't. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3468.52s)]
*  That's a lie. Stop it. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3470.52s)]
*  I've seen you tour, and it's like... [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3472.52s)]
*  Relentless. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3474.52s)]
*  Have you taken any time off outside of Tyres in the last four years? [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3476.52s)]
*  No. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3480.52s)]

*  I need to. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3486.52s)]
*  I need to. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3488.52s)]
*  I'd like to, yeah. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3490.52s)]
*  I probably will at the end of this tour. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3492.52s)]
*  You're going to film something, I assume. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3494.52s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to do the rest of this arena tour. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3496.52s)]
*  What a fucking... [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3500.52s)]
*  That's a nice thing. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3502.52s)]
*  Are you sensitized to the arenas yet? [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3504.52s)]
*  Every time? [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3506.52s)]
*  Yeah, like last night, it was like, God damn. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3508.52s)]
*  Derrick Posen says a thing to them. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3510.52s)]
*  It takes two basketball teams to fill up that arena. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3512.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty cool. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3514.52s)]
*  I was like, I sold that. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3516.52s)]
*  Also, great arena. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3518.52s)]
*  Shout out to the Indiana fans. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3520.52s)]
*  I just want to say, they are phenomenal. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3522.52s)]
*  I'm walking in, I'm thinking it's going to be beef, they're going to be annoyed. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3526.52s)]
*  We came in with gear and everything. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3530.52s)]
*  There's even a little part of me, like, I might be an asshole. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3532.52s)]
*  What the hell? [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3534.52s)]
*  But at the same time, they were so sweet, but also like, you're going to lose. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3536.52s)]
*  And they were like, almost... [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3540.52s)]
*  They're awesome. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3542.52s)]
*  It was unbelievable. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3544.52s)]
*  Indianapolis is slept on as a city. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3546.52s)]
*  I love Indianapolis. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3548.52s)]
*  Isn't it Nap Town? [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3550.52s)]
*  It's all small town people that go to a place, so it's kind of got a city, but everyone's got no ego. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3552.52s)]
*  I've been there once or twice. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3556.52s)]
*  Indianapolis is awesome. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3558.52s)]
*  Anyway, so you're in Iowa, you do this arena, and then you take a flight here. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3560.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3564.52s)]
*  You would have liked this. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3566.52s)]
*  Before I went on stage, Soder was with me on the road. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3568.52s)]
*  And while they were announcing me to go on stage, I looked at him and I was like, I just wanted to do a Wednesday night at Helium. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3570.52s)]
*  What the fuck is this? [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3576.52s)]
*  That was like my dream. I was like, I hope I get one night at Helium. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3578.52s)]
*  I don't know, this is out of control. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3580.52s)]
*  I don't know what the fuck's going on, dude. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3582.52s)]
*  Also, Money for Nothing? [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3584.52s)]
*  Unreal. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3586.52s)]
*  You played it for us, and I was like, it's kind of slaps. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3588.52s)]
*  But hearing it in the arena, from someone's phone, I was like, yeah, this is the one. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3590.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's awesome. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3594.52s)]
*  My girlfriend picked that. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3596.52s)]
*  Really? [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3598.52s)]
*  Yeah, and I didn't want to like it. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3600.52s)]
*  Because it was her suggestion? [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3602.52s)]
*  Yeah, she suggested it, and I was like, turn this shit the fuck off. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3604.52s)]
*  What are you talking about? And then it hit, and I was like... [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3606.52s)]
*  Alright, let's take a break for a second. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3608.52s)]
*  Today's sponsor is Kraken. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3610.52s)]
*  It is your go-to plug for everything investing. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3612.52s)]
*  I want to also clarify right here that Kraken made it out thriving. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3614.52s)]
*  Not just alive, thriving. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3616.52s)]
*  Every other crypto company, they fell apart. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3618.52s)]
*  Kraken, no. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3620.52s)]
*  Not only were they thriving, they were also thriving. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3622.52s)]
*  They're like, let's just take over the entire investment space. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3624.52s)]
*  That's what they're doing. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3626.52s)]
*  It's simple, it's secure, and it's fast. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3628.52s)]
*  And when the Bitcoin price is moving, use a platform that you can actually rely on. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3630.52s)]
*  Kraken has been around longer than 99% of the coins you've heard of, and they're still crushing it. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3632.52s)]
*  Trusted by over 13 million users from investing beginners to finance experts, moving serious money. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3634.52s)]
*  And they don't just give you the basics. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3636.52s)]
*  Kraken lets you buy it. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3638.52s)]

*  There's a mom who pulled up and pulled a kid out. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3932.52s)]
*  That's the worst. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3934.52s)]
*  It's a great mom, but that's gotta be the most embarrassing thing on both levels. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3936.52s)]
*  You're getting pulled out of line. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3940.52s)]
*  Everybody's seeing you, and then you gotta deal with your mom. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3942.52s)]

*  We choose to fuck a thousand women. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3974.52s)]
*  Why does Bonnie Blue fuck a thousand guys? [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3976.52s)]
*  Not because it's easy. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3978.52s)]
*  Not because it is hard. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=3980.52s)]

*  Bryce, legend. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4016.52s)]
*  Can we see the other angle? [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4018.52s)]
*  It's crazy how big Bryce is. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4020.52s)]
*  Bryce is the man. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4022.52s)]
*  He doesn't look that big, but the neck's a shame. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4024.52s)]
*  Actually, right there, and Steve refused to admit this, [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4026.52s)]
*  but he, same thing the Texas pitcher was saying, [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4028.52s)]
*  that I was throwing a shout out to Ace, [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4030.52s)]
*  he was like, [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4032.52s)]
*  you got a little break on that. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4034.52s)]
*  Stop. Stop it. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4036.52s)]
*  Not kidding. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4038.52s)]
*  He's going too far. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4040.52s)]
*  I don't refuse to admit that. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4042.52s)]
*  Let's get a better angle on that. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4044.52s)]
*  That was a crazy angle. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4046.52s)]
*  Get out of here. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4048.52s)]
*  Bryce Harper's first words are, [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4050.52s)]
*  you got a little break on that. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4052.52s)]
*  It's possible [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4054.52s)]
*  that the pitch was just dying. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4056.52s)]
*  For sure. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4058.52s)]
*  The guy knows baseball. It's Bryce Harper. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4060.52s)]
*  But that's believable. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4062.52s)]
*  I could buy that. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4064.52s)]
*  Did you clock it? Do you know what you came in? [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4066.52s)]
*  It's 50. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4068.52s)]
*  We got it. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4070.52s)]
*  It's pretty far away. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4072.52s)]
*  I'd like to see one of you [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4074.52s)]
*  butt fuckers try to hit me. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4076.52s)]
*  It's so scary. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4080.52s)]
*  Oh man, Steve's going nuts. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4082.52s)]
*  That's not bad, dude. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4084.52s)]

*  There's the miss high five. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4088.52s)]
*  I'd be very hyped if I called that. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4090.52s)]
*  I thought I was dead. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4092.52s)]
*  I thought I was... [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4094.52s)]

*  fucks you up. You have no idea why. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4098.52s)]
*  It's shocking how far away the catcher is. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4100.52s)]
*  And when they get in the stance, [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4102.52s)]
*  they're small. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4104.52s)]
*  I'm fucking Bryce Harper. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4106.52s)]
*  Are you already imagining the internet reaction [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4108.52s)]
*  if it doesn't go well? [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4110.52s)]
*  I knew I was going to look like a dumbass throwing. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4112.52s)]

*  That's crazy. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4850.52s)]
*  That's a little too much. It's crazy. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4852.52s)]
*  Like putting that in the metal detector. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4854.52s)]
*  And the guy [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4856.52s)]
*  who's running the little TSA machine, he's [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4858.52s)]

*  Compliments of the WAPs. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4874.52s)]
*  Some of those leagues need it. Some of them. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4878.52s)]
*  Australia, I don't know. I don't think it helps. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4880.52s)]
*  What do you mean? Like, uh... [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4882.52s)]
*  It doesn't seem to be helping the racism issue. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4884.52s)]
*  If I was a guy who was going to throw a banana [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4886.52s)]

*  America, like the obsession, is that [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4906.52s)]
*  like college football? [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4908.52s)]
*  Or like college sports in general? Is that the closest [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4910.52s)]
*  we have to European football? [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4912.52s)]
*  Where you didn't go to a college and you still care about it all day? [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4914.52s)]
*  Not even that, just like... [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4916.52s)]
*  What'd you say? [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4918.52s)]
*  Nothing wrong with that. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4920.52s)]
*  Notre Dame. Notre Dame all day. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4922.52s)]
*  You never just wanted to go? [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4924.52s)]
*  Yeah. Did you apply? [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4926.52s)]
*  No, I was going to play football and I couldn't [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4928.52s)]
*  get in there. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4930.52s)]
*  Army. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4932.52s)]
*  But because they played Notre Dame. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4934.52s)]
*  I would play [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4936.52s)]
*  in the stadium. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4938.52s)]
*  Actually, I think my senior year would have been [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4940.52s)]
*  Notre Dame, Army, in Yankee [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4942.52s)]
*  Stadium. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4944.52s)]
*  That would have been... [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4946.52s)]
*  Would have got killed by Notre Dame. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4948.52s)]
*  Would have been an honor. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4950.52s)]
*  But no, it turns out I sucked. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4952.52s)]
*  Why [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4954.52s)]

*  Is it just being Catholic? [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4958.52s)]
*  You were a tackle, right? [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4960.52s)]

*  My grandpa and [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4964.52s)]
*  cousin played for him. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4966.52s)]
*  My whole family. But either way, everybody... [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4968.52s)]
*  I went to a Catholic school [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4970.52s)]
*  in Pennsylvania, so everybody that was Catholic, [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4972.52s)]
*  no name. If you were Protestant, you liked Penn State. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4974.52s)]
*  Oh! [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4976.52s)]
*  So it really is Italy. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4978.52s)]
*  Scotland or any of these places. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4980.52s)]
*  Yeah. I think in Scotland, [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4982.52s)]
*  it's like Rangers and Celtic is divided by [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4984.52s)]
*  the Protestant. Yeah. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4986.52s)]

*  100%. Kirby, what are you thinking, my boy? [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4990.52s)]
*  Nothing. You're into more refined sports, [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4992.52s)]
*  like this golf and... [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=4994.52s)]

*  attention to us. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5040.52s)]
*  There was a hammered guy next to us at the bar. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5042.52s)]

*  2 p.m. Yeah. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5046.52s)]
*  We're at the bar, and then Steve [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5048.52s)]
*  leaves. No, because you were telling me to golf [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5050.52s)]

*  and said, get the fuck out of here, you piece of shit. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5072.52s)]
*  And the guy [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5074.52s)]
*  who wasn't doing anything wrong, he was just [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5076.52s)]

*  That's such a perfect [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5086.52s)]

*  And they had to trade him. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5458.52s)]
*  MLS fans gay. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5462.52s)]

*  Then the games would be worth going to. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5470.52s)]

*  Like part of the... [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5484.52s)]
*  It wasn't like a fan. It was like the... [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5486.52s)]
*  A section. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5488.52s)]
*  They're trying to get in the other team's head I think. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5490.52s)]
*  They see most of the law coming down to like... [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5492.52s)]
*  Oh this one got it. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5494.52s)]
*  This one got it. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5496.52s)]
*  So what is that? Like each team has to represent some like identity out there? [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5500.52s)]
*  Is that the idea? [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5504.52s)]
*  In England? [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5506.52s)]
*  Well I guess in England, yeah. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5508.52s)]
*  But isn't that kind of what happens? [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5510.52s)]
*  Like we were talking about with religion. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5512.52s)]
*  The Protestants have a team, the Catholics have a team, the Jews have a team... [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5514.52s)]
*  The trans have Arsenal. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5516.52s)]
*  You're a Tottenham guy. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5518.52s)]
*  Oh where? [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5520.52s)]
*  You like Tottenham. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5522.52s)]
*  What do they do? What do they have? [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5524.52s)]
*  Jews. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5526.52s)]
*  Chelsea and the Russians for a while. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5530.52s)]
*  That's pretty sick. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5532.52s)]
*  Yeah it's kind of tight. But then they force them to sell it. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5534.52s)]
*  That's right. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5536.52s)]
*  It's kind of wild. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5538.52s)]
*  They just say you have to sell this because you have relationships with... [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5540.52s)]
*  You're a Russian oligarch, yeah. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5542.52s)]
*  Wow. They didn't know he was a Russian oligarch when he paid $2 billion to fucking see it and dumped another billion into it? [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5544.52s)]
*  That seems like convenient timing, right? [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5548.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5550.52s)]
*  They force him to make billions of dollars and he's like flying. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5552.52s)]
*  And nothing happened to Man City who's owned by... [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5554.52s)]
*  I don't know who. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5556.52s)]
*  Eddie had, right? [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5558.52s)]
*  And then what does it go? Qatar does. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5560.52s)]
*  Is Paris... [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5562.52s)]
*  PSG? [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5564.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's PSG, right? [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5566.52s)]
*  But I think the difference is like sponsorships versus like the owner of the team being like [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5568.52s)]
*  a guy. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5570.52s)]
*  Just paying to be on the jersey. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5572.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5574.52s)]
*  How do you feel about that? I see that now in like the NBA jerseys. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5576.52s)]
*  They're starting to do like a little bit of sponsorship. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5578.52s)]
*  Bro, I don't like it. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5580.52s)]
*  I thought I would hate it a lot more. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5582.52s)]
*  There's some that I like. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5584.52s)]
*  I like OKC's... [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5586.52s)]
*  It's love's truck stop. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5588.52s)]
*  It's the brands we like. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5590.52s)]
*  Burger King did it, a genius one. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5592.52s)]
*  What did they do? [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5594.52s)]
*  So Burger King found a loophole in the FIFA games. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5596.52s)]
*  And so they sponsored like the worst team in the third division in the English Premier League. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5598.52s)]
*  Like the worst... [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5602.52s)]
*  Literally like they were 0-20. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5604.52s)]
*  Oh shit, and then you can trade for the other players? [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5606.52s)]
*  And then in FIFA, you can put Ronaldo in that jersey in Ultima Team. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5608.52s)]
*  And so now they are just reposting like Ronaldo wearing the Burger King jersey. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5612.52s)]
*  And for like $20,000, they got Messi, Ronaldo, Mbappe, everyone wearing the Burger King jersey. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5616.52s)]
*  Kind of genius. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5622.52s)]
*  But it's a video game? Yeah, in FIFA. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5624.52s)]
*  Are you really punching a hole in the story? [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5626.52s)]
*  No, I'm just trying to understand. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5628.52s)]
*  We all knew that part of it and we're just going to let him have it. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5630.52s)]
*  He's a genius. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5632.52s)]
*  Don't do that. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5634.52s)]
*  I was still like, what's going on? [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5636.52s)]
*  You wasted $20,000. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5638.52s)]
*  You could do this for free. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5640.52s)]
*  You could do this on AI right now. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5642.52s)]
*  Oh, Photoshop Burger King on the market. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5644.52s)]
*  What the fuck are we talking about? [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5646.52s)]
*  I'm sorry, you guys don't own business. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5648.52s)]
*  I'm sorry, you guys don't understand marketing and brands. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5650.52s)]
*  We've been on a whole journey. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5652.52s)]
*  And it's a video game? [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5654.52s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5656.52s)]
*  It was stupid. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5658.52s)]
*  The story sucked. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5660.52s)]
*  You just got to fucking let him have it. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5662.52s)]
*  You don't call it out. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5664.52s)]
*  I don't know what it was. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5666.52s)]
*  I know, I bet you they don't know what they're talking about. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5668.52s)]
*  I bet you it is smart. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5670.52s)]
*  I'm going to find that video and jerk it off. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5672.52s)]
*  That was condescending because he didn't mean that. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5674.52s)]
*  I'm going to find a jerk-off video and meet it. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5676.52s)]
*  Because they can't just do AI stuff. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5678.52s)]
*  So there's got to be some copyright loophole. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5680.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5682.52s)]
*  Gerv, you're a little bit of a bully too. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5684.52s)]
*  He's been bullying me the whole episode. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5686.52s)]
*  I think you're a little bit of a bully. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5688.52s)]
*  I see right through him. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5690.52s)]
*  I'm starting to think that Shane might just be surviving over here when he has to fight back. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5692.52s)]
*  I think he's busy getting punched down on by you a little bit. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5694.52s)]
*  The Gerbindoch is going to drop soon, dude. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5696.52s)]
*  I'm telling you. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5698.52s)]
*  We're going to be surviving Gerbindoch. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5700.52s)]
*  He's like, oh, let's dance. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5702.52s)]
*  He's like, shut the fuck up. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5704.52s)]
*  Who ate a tuna sandwich? [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5706.52s)]
*  He's like, shut the fuck up. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5708.52s)]
*  Who ate a tuna sandwich? [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5710.52s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5714.52s)]
*  We got on a plane. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5716.52s)]
*  This is what I do for this guy. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5718.52s)]
*  We were on a private jet to the Masters. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5720.52s)]
*  I don't give a fuck about golf. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5722.52s)]
*  You guys went to the Masters? [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5724.52s)]
*  It was dog shit. It sucked. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5726.52s)]
*  But we're flying back and he's definitely [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5730.52s)]
*  so afraid of flying. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5732.52s)]
*  We get on the plane and he's like, [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5734.52s)]
*  I'm just going to get off. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5736.52s)]
*  I'm going to drive. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5738.52s)]
*  I'm going to drive from Georgia. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5740.52s)]
*  He started hyperventilating. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5742.52s)]
*  He was like, just fucking chill, whatever. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5744.52s)]
*  And then I was like, would it help if I just [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5746.52s)]
*  started blasting some Drake right now? [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5748.52s)]

*  No, that's not true. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5766.52s)]
*  I did read that in the research. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5768.52s)]
*  That you will listen to the Pirates of the Caribbean soundtrack. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5770.52s)]
*  There's research? [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5772.52s)]
*  We're serious journalists. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=5774.52s)]

*  Might be a thing that a superstar like you does [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6132.52s)]
*  at the end of season three of Tires. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6134.52s)]

*  of the drawings [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6160.52s)]
*  for what the architect [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6162.52s)]
*  made to turn the place into a shop. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6164.52s)]

*  Besides forgetting the gift he got you. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6178.52s)]
*  I got him a TV show on Netflix. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6180.52s)]
*  And I took him to the Masters. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6184.52s)]
*  I feel like that's pretty nice. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6186.52s)]

*  I don't even want to go now. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6200.52s)]
*  Why not? [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6202.52s)]
*  Would you go without me? [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6204.52s)]
*  No, you gotta go with him. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6206.52s)]
*  You would ditch Shane while you guys are in New York together [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6208.52s)]
*  to go to the Friends Museum? [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6210.52s)]
*  Of course. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6212.52s)]
*  No, Gurbz, you take him, you guys get a picture together on the couch. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6214.52s)]
*  Reenact a scene. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6220.52s)]
*  That could be fun. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6222.52s)]
*  He doesn't watch Friends. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6224.52s)]

*  None of them are jacking off on Zoom. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6242.52s)]
*  I actually kind of match up to Swimmer. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6244.52s)]
*  You think you're more of a David Swimmer? [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6246.52s)]

*  You think it just keeps on getting crazier? [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6294.52s)]
*  What do you think was the biggest adjustment in his attitude from season 1 to 2? [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6296.52s)]
*  He could tell you. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6298.52s)]
*  It's out of control. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6300.52s)]
*  I mean, the robe, the fucking... [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6302.52s)]
*  One robe experience. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6304.52s)]
*  He would get in the morning with hair and makeup and he would sing. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6306.52s)]
*  What would you sing? [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6308.52s)]
*  Just whatever we were singing. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6310.52s)]
*  You know, they have songs on. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6312.52s)]
*  All these people have to be nice to him. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6314.52s)]
*  He's the fucking lead. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6316.52s)]
*  He's like, oh, come on, girls, let's sing a little song. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6318.52s)]
*  He's like, come on, girls, let's sing a little song. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6320.52s)]

*  So we had a good time. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6326.52s)]
*  And I wore a robe once. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6328.52s)]
*  I literally left the thing with the safety pin in it. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6330.52s)]
*  I was like, I'll never wear that if Shane sees me in that. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6332.52s)]
*  I'm fucking done for. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6334.52s)]
*  And then there was an underwear situation. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6336.52s)]
*  Something happened in one of these costumes. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6338.52s)]
*  I had to put it on. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6340.52s)]
*  He saw me. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6342.52s)]

*  He's like, oh, come on, girls, let's sing a little song. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6346.52s)]
*  I had to put it on. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6348.52s)]
*  He saw me. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6350.52s)]
*  The days where you and Shane are not in scenes together, like you don't see him. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6352.52s)]
*  What are those days like? [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6354.52s)]
*  I find out about it. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6356.52s)]
*  And it's crazy. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6358.52s)]
*  He's totally different when I'm not there. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6360.52s)]
*  He becomes Tom Cruise. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6362.52s)]
*  Comfortable. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6364.52s)]
*  You're acting, you're singing. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6366.52s)]
*  He's a fucking theater kid. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6368.52s)]
*  He's fucking singing. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6370.52s)]
*  Off camera. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWaYG2K49s&t=6372.52s)]
