**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [April 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg)
*  What's up, Flager family, and welcome to the show. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=0.0s)]
*  Guys, it's looking like the end of times out there. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2.88s)]
*  We've had an earthquake in New York City. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5.36s)]
*  We've had a solar eclipse. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7.36s)]
*  There is trouble in conservative paradise. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=9.28s)]
*  There might be a debate between Ben Shapiro and Candice Owens. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=11.68s)]
*  And rap beef is no more. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=15.92s)]
*  What is happening to this world that we are living in? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  It's too soft. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=21.76s)]
*  Too soft. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=23.28s)]
*  Shall we start with the rap beef? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=23.92s)]
*  We can. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=25.52s)]
*  So clearly, there's a lovely, delicious rap beef brewing. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=26.96s)]
*  Kendrick Lamar sent some shots out. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=32.72s)]
*  A decade, right? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=35.2s)]
*  Yeah, probably a decade in the making. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=35.92s)]
*  End times prophecy of rap beefs. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, this is it, dude. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=39.2s)]
*  End times prophecy of rap beefs. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=39.92s)]
*  We get to finally see who is number one. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=41.68s)]
*  Kendrick throws some shots out. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  It looks like he's just throwing some jabs trying to elicit a reaction. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=45.68s)]
*  J. Cole gives him the reaction, and then what happens? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=49.68s)]
*  Then he apologized, bro. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=53.04s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  Give us the context of this apology. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=55.68s)]
*  Well, first I gotta start, I've never been more wrong. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=57.28s)]
*  I predicted big things at Dreamville, and big things happened. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=61.76s)]
*  Drake's coming out of Dreamville! [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=65.92s)]
*  No, bro. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=67.28s)]
*  It's his WrestleMania. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=68.24s)]
*  Thank you for honoring us. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=69.52s)]
*  Thank you for honoring us. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=70.64s)]
*  Black people's WrestleMania. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=71.68s)]
*  They were so excited. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  Technically, it was supposed to happen. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=74.08s)]
*  Something changed. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=76.8s)]
*  Because I did get a word that he was supposed to go to Dreamville. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=78.32s)]
*  And probably Drake, I mean, Cole releasing this little diss track. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  Maybe he might have changed his plans on that. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=84.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=87.11999999999999s)]
*  It was a last minute change that Drake did. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=88.24s)]
*  He meaning Drake. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  So Drake was gonna go to Dreamville, and then he's like, no, I'm not. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he predicted Drake was gonna go to Dreamville, drop a diss. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=93.44s)]
*  And now Dreamville, for everybody who's watching, is unaware, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=95.83999999999999s)]
*  is a concert that J. Cole throws in his hometown. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=98.55999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  Okay, so Northeastern North Carolina? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=102.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=104.16s)]
*  Greensboro or something like that? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=105.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=106.63999999999999s)]
*  Is that it? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=106.96s)]
*  We should know that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=107.44s)]
*  So he throws a huge concert. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  I think there's like 50,000 people there, something crazy. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=109.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=111.44s)]
*  And then he goes on stage, and the video we see is he's apologizing for the... [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=111.76s)]
*  I've never been so disappointed. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=119.36s)]
*  Okay, talk through it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=121.2s)]
*  So it's like hip hop has always been a competitive thing. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=122.56s)]
*  Like it's always, I'm the best, I'm the top dog. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=125.68s)]
*  And finally, we were getting some of that energy again in hip hop. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  Like we haven't had it for a really long time. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=132.4s)]
*  And for a decade, there had been this debate who's number one between these three. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=134.16s)]
*  Kendrick, Drake, Cole. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=136.8s)]
*  Now there was somebody who said this, and I don't want to... [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=138.0s)]
*  I wish I remembered exactly who, but it was maybe it was academics, but it was like, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=140.08s)]
*  you can't pull out of the safest rap beef ever. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  None of them are going to kill one another. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  It's one thing when people start getting shot, your security is getting murdered. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  You're like, okay, let's calm this thing down. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=152.96s)]
*  This was only going to be bars. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=154.96s)]
*  Alex, continue. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=157.84s)]
*  So Cole drops a surprise album on Friday, like a couple days before Dreamville concert. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=159.44s)]
*  And one of the songs on there, it's a seven minute drill where he's taking shots at Kendrick. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=167.28s)]
*  He was responding to That's It by Kendrick's, Distract towards him. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=172.16s)]
*  It was mediocre at best. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=179.52s)]
*  He didn't seem like he wanted to beef. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=181.52s)]
*  Like it was just like very lackluster. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=184.4s)]
*  And then two days later, he apologized for making this distract and like, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=186.72s)]
*  hey, I regret doing this. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=190.48s)]
*  It wasn't, it didn't feel good. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=192.8s)]
*  He's losing sleep over it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=195.6s)]
*  How do you lose sleep over making a distract? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=197.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=200.0s)]
*  So how do you lose sleep over making a distract? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=200.32s)]
*  So I've thought about, okay, I've thought about this. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=202.24s)]
*  I've thought about this. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=204.0s)]
*  So this, I'm going to give, um, this is, I'm going to give, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  I'm going to give, I don't even want to call it pushback. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=209.84s)]
*  I'm going to give another perspective on this, right? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=212.16s)]
*  J Cole has existed around the top three rappers for what? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=215.2s)]
*  The last eight years. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=220.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=222.64s)]
*  Maybe 10 years. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=223.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=223.84s)]
*  I'm not exactly. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=224.16s)]
*  But like has been respected by everybody, loved by everybody, making tons of money, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=224.8s)]
*  never really beefing with anybody. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=231.12s)]
*  Seriously. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=233.36s)]
*  He's lived like a pretty spiritually high journey in the rap game, which is hard. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=234.08s)]
*  Think about what Drake got to go through on a daily basis. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=239.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=242.08s)]
*  Everybody come at his fucking head. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=242.56s)]
*  Every single person, the young bucks are coming at him. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=244.72000000000003s)]
*  The old dudes are coming at him. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=247.20000000000002s)]
*  Their distracts come from every different direction. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  You got to put a fire out here. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=250.72000000000003s)]
*  You got to put a fire out here. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=251.76000000000002s)]
*  You got to put a fire. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  That's a stressful fucking life. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=253.36s)]
*  J Cole gets to be a hippie, smoke weed. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=256.32s)]
*  If he, I don't even know if he smokes weed, go help out the community, wear whatever the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=260.40000000000003s)]
*  fuck he wants. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=264.0s)]
*  He gets to really exist. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=264.88s)]
*  He's Snapple. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=266.72s)]
*  Remember Snapple did that thing like we're number three. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=268.08000000000004s)]
*  When you're number three, you could mess around with flavors. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=270.40000000000003s)]
*  You could make a banana flavored or a raspberry flavored. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=273.2s)]
*  Remember he's like Coca-Cola and Pepsi. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=276.16s)]
*  They can't do anything because they're number one and two. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=277.68s)]
*  But number three, that's when you get to experiment and have fun. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  And he has been able to experiment and have fun. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=283.36s)]
*  And he is unanimously respected, maybe not considered the number one, but to his fans, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=285.76s)]
*  he's the number one, which is what's really important. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=292.24s)]
*  Who gives a fuck what the people aren't your fans think? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=294.56s)]
*  If your fans think you're number one, you're number one. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=296.48s)]
*  But now he's friends with everybody. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=299.2s)]
*  Now he engages in this beef. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=300.8s)]
*  He loses the peace. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=303.28000000000003s)]
*  He loses the sanctity. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=304.72s)]
*  Maybe he loses what he really wants. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=306.16s)]
*  Maybe he doesn't care about being unanimous number one in the way Drake does. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=307.92s)]
*  That's probably Drake's dream is I need to be the greatest rapper ever. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=312.08s)]
*  Maybe what he likes is his position in the game. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=315.44s)]
*  He likes being Snapple. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=317.76s)]
*  And the second he start to feel the pressure of being Coke, he was like, fuck this, I'm out. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=319.12s)]
*  I would agree with you if he hasn't for the past three years been saying he's the best. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=324.24s)]
*  He's number one. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=328.47999999999996s)]
*  He's been saying it more and more and actually starting to believe it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=330.24s)]
*  And he's actually been rapping his ass off. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=334.79999999999995s)]
*  No, he's so nice. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=336.47999999999996s)]
*  And nobody's. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=337.59999999999997s)]
*  So it's like, I don't know. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=337.91999999999996s)]
*  You can't just keep going for the spot. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=340.32s)]
*  Snapple is better than Coke. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=342.56s)]
*  Like it is. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=344.8s)]
*  No. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=345.44s)]
*  It's better than Diet Coke. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=346.4s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=349.52s)]
*  Let me get there. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=351.6s)]
*  Let me get there. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=352.32s)]
*  A DC without lemon is nothing. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=353.12s)]
*  A DC without lemon is sludge. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=357.68s)]
*  A DC without lemon is poison. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=359.2s)]
*  If I don't have a lemon that I can put in a DC, it's not even a DC. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=360.64s)]
*  A DC shouldn't even be sold without lemon. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=363.68s)]
*  It's a straw, a napkin, and a lemon should come with every single DC. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=365.76s)]
*  Coke in a glass bottle anywhere outside of America, fire. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=369.04s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=372.88s)]
*  First of all, now you're taking me internationally. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=373.76000000000005s)]
*  But that's what it's supposed to be. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=375.76000000000005s)]
*  The fact that you need to create a caveat that's international just shows me that you [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=376.32s)]
*  don't believe in Coke in America. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=379.84000000000003s)]
*  I just that's the real Coke. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=381.36s)]
*  It's just the sugar. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=382.48s)]
*  That's it. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=383.20000000000005s)]
*  Which country are you loyal to? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=383.68s)]
*  Hey, listen here, Ben Shapiro. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=386.08000000000004s)]
*  Which country does your true loyalty lie? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=388.48s)]
*  Oh, a Mexican Coke is way better than a right hander. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=390.24s)]
*  At least I'm stepping out of my Overton window. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=392.88s)]
*  At least I'm stepping out of my Overton window. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=394.64000000000004s)]
*  Where you at? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=396.56s)]
*  Okay, take that right wing Twitter and have some fun for a week. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=397.59999999999997s)]
*  Warm Snapple is like a quarter water. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=401.91999999999996s)]
*  Like it's not good at all. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=404.08s)]
*  Oh yeah, okay, now you're bringing temperature into this. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=405.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean you brought lemon. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=407.44s)]
*  If you come into a Snapple it sucks. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=409.35999999999996s)]
*  It tastes like what? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=410.96s)]
*  He brought lemon into it. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=412.0s)]
*  How do you bring that? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=413.2s)]
*  You're adding to the flavor. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=414.4s)]
*  We're assuming refrigeration on all beverages. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=415.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=418.47999999999996s)]
*  What I'm trying to say is, which I thought was our baseline. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=418.96s)]
*  I like how they started us rap beef and we're like, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=422.47999999999996s)]
*  let me tell you what the best drink of the month is. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=424.4s)]
*  What's the most refreshing? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=425.91999999999996s)]
*  Okay, so I guess what I'm trying to say is, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=428.47999999999996s)]
*  maybe J. Cole preferred his position of being beloved by everybody, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=431.12s)]
*  respected by everybody and then not bearing the weight of a beef. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=436.79999999999995s)]
*  The weight of a beef is heavy. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=440.08s)]
*  I think maybe he wanted, I agree with Al, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=442.15999999999997s)]
*  he did say he wanted to be number one. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=444.08s)]
*  Maybe when he got there. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=445.28s)]
*  Without actually doing it. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=446.15999999999997s)]
*  But I think when he, do you know what I'm saying? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=446.96s)]
*  Like in rap, sorry to cut you, but like you get to say your number. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=448.47999999999996s)]
*  Everybody says their number. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=451.76s)]
*  Everybody says their number. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=452.47999999999996s)]
*  I got the most bitches, I make the most money, I got it. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=453.12s)]
*  But he was doing it to Al's point. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=455.03999999999996s)]
*  He was the best. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=456.56s)]
*  But I think when he started to get there, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=457.2s)]
*  not everybody seeing you as number one, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=458.88s)]
*  and then they start shooting at you at number one, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=460.16s)]
*  heavy is the head, the word is the crown. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=462.24s)]
*  You're like, hey man, take that. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=463.68s)]
*  But also, you got to talk shit about someone. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=465.44s)]
*  It's possible, but you don't make the diss track then. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=469.76s)]
*  But like, yeah, that's what I'm saying. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=472.4s)]
*  Like I think in order to quote unquote be number one, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=473.52s)]
*  he has to talk shit about someone that he respects and admires. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=476.08s)]
*  And that sucks. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=479.68s)]
*  I think he probably went to bed being like, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=480.48s)]
*  why the fuck did I do this? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=482.4s)]
*  Why am I engaging in this petty nonsense? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=484.15999999999997s)]
*  For what? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=487.35999999999996s)]
*  So that the casuals who don't think I'm number one [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=487.84s)]
*  can now think I'm number one? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=490.32s)]
*  I mean, he says that. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=492.32s)]
*  He goes, I want to protect my peace. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=492.88s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, that's far. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=494.08s)]
*  His peace wasn't disturbed after first person shooter [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=496.24s)]
*  when he makes a fucking banger where he's saying, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=498.79999999999995s)]
*  hey, I'm Muhammad Ali out of these three guys. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=501.03999999999996s)]
*  But now when he drops a weak diss track, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=504.0s)]
*  now all of a sudden my peace is this guy. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=506.79999999999995s)]
*  I'm not into this. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=508.47999999999996s)]
*  I'm not into what he did. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=509.91999999999996s)]
*  Muhammad Ali's not the greatest boxer ever. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=511.03999999999996s)]
*  I just. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=512.72s)]
*  He's like the Snapple Boxer. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=514.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he's the Snapple Boxer. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=516.0s)]
*  It's the one we all like the most. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=517.44s)]
*  It's the one we enjoy the most. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=518.88s)]
*  It has the best quotes. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=520.0s)]
*  Floyd Mayweather is the greatest boxer ever. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=520.64s)]
*  I don't think he wrote that thinking I'm not the greatest. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=522.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=525.28s)]
*  It's what he wrote down. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=525.36s)]
*  I don't think that was his intention when he wrote it. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=526.64s)]
*  No. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=528.0s)]
*  And again, I don't know if that's intention. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=528.5600000000001s)]
*  But even the way I interpret it, he's the most beloved. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=530.08s)]
*  There's not one person that doesn't love Muhammad Ali. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=533.12s)]
*  But true boxing enthusiasts will say that he wasn't the greatest boxer. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=536.08s)]
*  But as a rap fan listening to a rap song, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=539.76s)]
*  he's saying he's the greatest. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=541.6s)]
*  Sure. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=543.0400000000001s)]
*  He doesn't shit on anyone. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=543.52s)]
*  But that's the one thing. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=544.88s)]
*  The only thing he did that was kind of I remember thinking in the moment, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=545.76s)]
*  I was like, oh, this feels a little he says the big three, me and Kendrick, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=548.48s)]
*  or whatever. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=551.36s)]
*  And then when he says the Spider-Man meme is me looking at Drake, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=551.76s)]
*  I do remember being like, oh, you kind of left Kendrick out of that. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=554.5600000000001s)]
*  But I don't think I think he was trying to do the J Cole thing [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=558.64s)]
*  to be fair to him where he's like, hey, we're all great. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=562.08s)]
*  I'm the best because we're doing the rap thing. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=564.72s)]
*  I'm making sure everybody feels good about themselves. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=566.5600000000001s)]
*  And that's just not, dude, this is we're just old. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=569.12s)]
*  I think we're like, I'm almost 40. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=571.52s)]
*  I'm looking at this. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=573.92s)]
*  I want the rappers to be what I grew up with. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=575.12s)]
*  I think kids are just not like that as much anymore. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=577.36s)]
*  They're like, terrified and well adjusted. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=579.6s)]
*  Not some kids. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=581.6s)]
*  Not even close. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=582.3199999999999s)]
*  It's just not in rap. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=584.72s)]
*  It's in streaming. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=585.6s)]
*  If you want real beef, you got to go to streaming. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=587.84s)]
*  That's what a real beef is. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=590.24s)]
*  Rap, you're not going to find no real beef. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=591.76s)]
*  Okay, well, I'm 40 again. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=593.12s)]

*  Okay, come on. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=600.56s)]
*  Turbo, special team. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=601.36s)]
*  Come on, brother. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=603.44s)]
*  We need some real beef from you, J. Cole. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=604.5600000000001s)]
*  You need some real beef. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=608.16s)]
*  No, he was. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=610.48s)]
*  He's definitely that. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=612.5600000000001s)]
*  I respect it. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=613.6s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=615.92s)]
*  I understand where he's coming from. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=616.48s)]
*  And I, selfishly, you just want carnage, right? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=619.36s)]
*  He wants to see black men fight. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=624.0s)]
*  That's what I want. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=625.28s)]
*  You want to see black men fight. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=626.32s)]
*  Spar. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=628.08s)]
*  That's true. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=629.14s)]
*  Black men loves, they love boxing. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=630.82s)]
*  Yeah, come on. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=632.4200000000001s)]
*  Nice little slap box. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=633.38s)]
*  You know, that's just fun with your friends. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=634.74s)]
*  Why can't we see black men love each other? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=635.7800000000001s)]
*  Why can't they just love each other? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=636.58s)]
*  There's a lot of that too. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=638.0200000000001s)]
*  Go to Atlanta. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=638.98s)]
*  What if they just dick punches and shit like that? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=639.7s)]
*  Yeah, go to Atlanta. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=641.7s)]
*  Shit. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=642.58s)]
*  You don't want to see that shit. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=643.5400000000001s)]
*  Come on. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=645.0600000000001s)]
*  You want to see real blood. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=645.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=647.0600000000001s)]
*  You want to see blood. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=647.38s)]
*  No, I think we want to see someone come out of this and be like, oh, that's the guy. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=648.26s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=652.1800000000001s)]
*  I think that's what we want. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=652.58s)]
*  We want a champion. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=653.7s)]
*  What we got out of this is now knowing who's not the guy. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=654.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=657.7s)]
*  Does that ever happen though? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=657.86s)]
*  Cole can never be the guy. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=658.9000000000001s)]
*  Does that ever happen in a rap beef where like, oh, so Nas is the guy? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=659.46s)]
*  No, but he clearly won the battle. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=663.94s)]
*  There's no question who won. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=666.6600000000001s)]
*  Drake and Meek, Drake clearly won the battle. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=667.7s)]
*  Meek can never be that guy after that. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=670.5s)]
*  It's one of those things where it's just like, hey, this person is better than you [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=673.3000000000001s)]
*  when you guys battle each other. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=677.46s)]
*  Even Push clearly beat Drake, even if Drake is great. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=679.38s)]
*  Nobody even remembers. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=682.74s)]
*  So then it doesn't prove who the guy is. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=683.7s)]
*  People remember that. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=685.0600000000001s)]
*  People remember. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=685.86s)]
*  You know, didn't forget. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=686.1800000000001s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=686.98s)]
*  Make that. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=687.38s)]
*  But like everyone knows the ether beat. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=687.78s)]
*  Like everyone knows like, yo, Nas body Jay-Z, but then it's like, Jay-Z is still the guy. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=689.3000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=693.0600000000001s)]
*  But so it doesn't prove anything. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=693.62s)]
*  Here's the gap. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=694.82s)]
*  The gap between Jay-Z and Nas way bigger. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=696.1s)]
*  And I don't mean in terms of rap skill, but just accolades and sales and everything and [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=699.78s)]
*  duration way bigger than the gap between Cole, Kendrick, Drake. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=703.54s)]
*  But the point is at the time it wasn't. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=707.46s)]
*  And then Nas won and Jay-Z got here. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=710.34s)]
*  So despite losing, he still got here. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=714.74s)]
*  So Mark's point, it doesn't really decide. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=717.14s)]
*  All it does is decide for that moment with Push and Drake. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=719.86s)]
*  It decided for that moment. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=722.66s)]
*  And then Drake just went here and now we don't really know what Push is doing. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=723.7s)]
*  So it doesn't really decide anything. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=727.3s)]
*  It helps us. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=729.22s)]
*  We enjoy it. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=729.94s)]
*  We like to chew on it. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=731.22s)]
*  It's nice and fatty. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=732.26s)]
*  But the reality is it doesn't really dictate career. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=733.46s)]
*  I do think at this level, they've been in the game so long. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=736.98s)]
*  I do think, yeah, I guess, I mean, how old is Jay Cole? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=739.62s)]
*  He's in mid 30. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=742.58s)]
*  He could keep going. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=743.38s)]
*  He could. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=744.18s)]
*  But I think when it's this close, we're talking tiebreakers. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=744.9s)]
*  Maybe a beef is like a tiebreaker. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=748.3399999999999s)]
*  And I think this was the tiebreaker because we don't see. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=751.38s)]
*  We see them here and we've seen them here for 10 years now. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=754.18s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=756.42s)]
*  I never. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=757.06s)]
*  And this is with all due respect to Jay Cole. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=757.9399999999999s)]
*  I've never seen him in that. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=760.18s)]
*  I don't see Kendrick there. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=762.9799999999999s)]
*  It's Drake and that's it. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=765.14s)]
*  And there's a big drop off after Drake. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=767.06s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=769.38s)]
*  And then and Jay Cole, I think, is so beloved and respected and thought of as [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=769.8599999999999s)]
*  like a nice guy. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=773.54s)]
*  And then every time he does a feature, you're like, is this guy the best rapper [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=774.66s)]
*  on the fucking planet? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=777.4599999999999s)]
*  You're like, this is incredible. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=778.26s)]
*  He's just so skilled at the thing and so loved that you're like, yeah, I think he's up there. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=779.86s)]
*  But he's not really. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=783.9399999999999s)]
*  I mean, if you're only going by sales, then I can see what you say. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=784.74s)]
*  No, not sales. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=787.9399999999999s)]
*  But in terms of like musical ability and how they craft albums, they all make amazing. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=788.42s)]
*  No, they're all masterful at their craft. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=794.02s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=796.0999999999999s)]
*  They're all masterful. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=796.5s)]
*  I'm talking about like cultural impact, like even Kendrick. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=797.3s)]
*  Kendrick might come out, drop and then it's a big explosion for a little bit. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=800.34s)]
*  It's like a streaming show. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=803.86s)]
*  It's like he comes out. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=804.98s)]
*  There's a season of it. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=805.86s)]
*  Everybody's consuming it. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=806.8199999999999s)]
*  And then after that, we take a break from Kendrick. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=808.02s)]
*  Whereas like Drake is just omnipresent. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=810.5s)]
*  You walk into fucking H&M, it's going to be Drake. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=814.58s)]
*  You walk into the club, it's going to be Drake. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=817.14s)]
*  You're at the fucking airport. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=819.46s)]
*  It's just everywhere. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=821.14s)]
*  This isn't an escape. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=822.1s)]
*  This isn't a perfect analogy because the show I'm going to compare the artist to [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=823.3s)]
*  put out more content. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=826.58s)]
*  But it's like Drake is friends. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=827.54s)]
*  Kendrick is curb. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=829.06s)]
*  Larry David comes out with a season whenever he kind of feels like coming out with a season. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=831.4599999999999s)]
*  Now he's put out like 12 seasons over 30 years or whatever. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=834.18s)]
*  But friends, bangers consistently, but you kind of know what you're getting. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=836.5s)]
*  And it kind of is what it is. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=840.9s)]
*  It's good. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=842.3399999999999s)]
*  I love that show. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=842.98s)]
*  It's great. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=843.9399999999999s)]
*  Curb is its own thing. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=844.8199999999999s)]
*  Comparing the two is tough, but you're like those are all time great shows. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=846.26s)]
*  So there's maybe like more density to a Kendrick album. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=850.3399999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=854.5799999999999s)]
*  And that's reflective over the fact that like it takes him several years to put together [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=855.14s)]
*  while Drake, it might take him several months to put together. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=860.02s)]
*  He's putting out, Kendrick's putting out a piece. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=862.34s)]
*  This is a piece. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=865.06s)]
*  It's art. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=866.02s)]
*  It is what it is. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=866.58s)]
*  However we feel about it, that is he put everything into this for years. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=867.6999999999999s)]
*  And that's the project. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=871.22s)]
*  Drake will give you consistent bangers and they're not going to hit this level of artistry. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=872.42s)]
*  But them motherfuckers are going to consistently hit you. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=875.86s)]
*  You just translated into the white, bro. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=877.6999999999999s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=879.14s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=879.7s)]
*  I'll be honest. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=881.9399999999999s)]
*  I was like, do y'all listen to Kendrick? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=882.42s)]
*  Do you put it on? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=885.62s)]
*  I don't put it on. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=886.9s)]
*  I don't put on Drake. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=887.6999999999999s)]
*  But definitely not as much Drake, but I do. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=888.9799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I don't. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=890.8199999999999s)]
*  I put on J. Cole features out of all these three the most. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=891.86s)]
*  Like I was listening to London after seven minutes. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=895.06s)]
*  That was cool. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=896.9799999999999s)]
*  Let me listen to London. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=897.62s)]
*  And I was like, this shit is so crazy. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=898.5799999999999s)]
*  That London song is so incredible. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=899.62s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=901.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=902.42s)]
*  But now we're talking about Cole. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=903.14s)]
*  I guess what I'm saying is we all just like Carnage. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=904.26s)]
*  We want to see him. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=906.5s)]
*  You want to see it. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=907.2199999999999s)]
*  You want to see fucking YouTubers box. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=908.18s)]
*  We can't see a fucking rap. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=910.5s)]
*  But also this is a friendly. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=911.7s)]
*  But now we're getting what we actually want. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=913.94s)]
*  I don't think anybody wanted to see J. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=915.86s)]
*  Cole and Drake go against Kendrick together. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=917.94s)]
*  That's a two on one. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=920.58s)]
*  If anything, J. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=921.7800000000001s)]
*  Cole separates himself, maintains his relationship [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=922.98s)]
*  with both guys. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=925.3000000000001s)]
*  They get to all adapt up when they hang out. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=926.1800000000001s)]
*  Everybody still likes J. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=927.7800000000001s)]
*  Cole. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=928.82s)]
*  He gets to do features for everybody. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=929.0600000000001s)]
*  He doesn't live with the beef or looking over his shoulder. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=930.58s)]
*  Drake is used to that. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=933.46s)]
*  He's like, this is going to be my life. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=934.34s)]
*  I'm looking over my shoulder. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=935.5400000000001s)]
*  I got security. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=936.4200000000001s)]
*  I got hood dudes over here who got my back. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=937.22s)]
*  I'm partnered up with these dudes in Houston. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=939.7800000000001s)]
*  These dudes in Toronto. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=941.46s)]
*  Like I'm set up. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=942.34s)]
*  So he's used to that fucking life. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=943.7800000000001s)]
*  Whereas J. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=945.62s)]
*  Cole's like, I don't think I want that life. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=946.1s)]
*  I don't want to look over my fucking shoulder. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=947.86s)]
*  And not like he would have to in this scenario. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=950.02s)]
*  That just sucks. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=952.58s)]
*  I genuinely think if you, in order to get where you want [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=953.22s)]
*  in your career, had to shit on someone you really admired [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=955.86s)]
*  and respected, how would you feel? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=958.1s)]
*  Well, that's how I felt last week with Ben Shapiro. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=960.02s)]
*  Like if you look throughout my career, I really love, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=963.94s)]
*  respect, and admired him. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=966.5s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=967.7s)]
*  It's not like I've ever made fun of him for the last decade. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=968.6600000000001s)]
*  No, just two Jews in solidarity. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=971.06s)]
*  Yeah, we were together. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=972.9s)]
*  And I've just, you know, every chance I had, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=974.3399999999999s)]
*  like tried to talk about what a genius this guy is [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=976.9s)]
*  and how amazing is the debate [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=978.9799999999999s)]
*  and how much I love his political opinion. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=980.3399999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=983.38s)]
*  Like if you actually look, if you look at my discography, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=983.8599999999999s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=987.4599999999999s)]
*  If you look at what I've done on this platform, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=988.0999999999999s)]
*  you will see a unanimous support. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=990.66s)]
*  I have a point that I forgot. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=992.02s)]
*  The point that you're trying to make is the greatest beef [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=993.9399999999999s)]
*  between a black person and a Jewish person [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=995.8599999999999s)]
*  is not Drake versus Ken. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=997.6199999999999s)]
*  It's Candice and Ben Shapiro. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1000.42s)]
*  And we put that on the map. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1002.5799999999999s)]
*  We made that happen. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1004.5s)]
*  It's going down. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1006.0999999999999s)]
*  Okay? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1007.62s)]
*  And I'm backing out like J. Cole. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1009.14s)]
*  Guys, beef is toxic. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1014.26s)]
*  I don't want anything to do with it. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1015.86s)]
*  Okay, this is too much pressure. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1017.62s)]
*  Too much pressure. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1020.02s)]
*  You really did ignite right with Twitter though. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1022.66s)]
*  Bro, it was crazy. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1024.42s)]
*  I looked up Twitter, every single thing. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1026.58s)]
*  I mean, every different community is using me [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1029.78s)]
*  in whatever way suits them. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1032.26s)]
*  It is a forest fire. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1034.26s)]
*  I saw almost exclusively praise. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1036.82s)]
*  I don't know what you're seeing, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1039.22s)]
*  but I saw almost exclusively people being like, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1040.82s)]
*  thank you, we can finally hate Jews. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1042.8999999999999s)]
*  It was praise for shit you don't want to be praised for. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1045.78s)]
*  But we got to get to the bottom of this. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1048.98s)]
*  I got to figure out. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1050.18s)]
*  Yeah, I just think. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1050.8999999999999s)]
*  You wouldn't moderate? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1052.34s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1054.42s)]
*  Rap battle? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1054.98s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1055.7s)]
*  I would moderate the rap battle if they did it through rap. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1056.26s)]
*  There's a greater chance for violence in this beef [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1059.54s)]
*  than any of the rap beefs. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1062.1s)]
*  That's an interesting one. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1065.22s)]
*  Moderate the debate between Candice and... [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1066.26s)]
*  So what do I ask them? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1069.38s)]
*  Jews? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1071.6200000000001s)]
*  How do you feel about that? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1073.22s)]
*  What are the questions that you want them to speak on? [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1074.26s)]
*  Just like, what are your opinions on Israel? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1078.66s)]
*  Don't they both know? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1080.9s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like they've already said that. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1082.1s)]
*  They both said their opinions, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1083.38s)]
*  so now they're going to debate the efficacy of their opinions? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1084.34s)]
*  Yeah, that is debating. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1087.1399999999999s)]
*  So both of them are claiming that the other person is not being [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1089.06s)]
*  a genuine or honest or truthful in their opinions about Israel and Palestine? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1091.6999999999998s)]
*  No, I think it's whose views are superior is the point of a debate. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1096.5s)]
*  You take two high level people on two issues, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1099.22s)]
*  on one device of issue, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1101.3s)]
*  two high level people on both sides of that issue have at it, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1103.1399999999999s)]
*  and then the person who wins that side is like, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1106.34s)]
*  fuck you and your opinions, y'all are wrong or right. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1108.98s)]
*  She's just describing a debate. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1111.22s)]
*  Yeah, she's describing a debate. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1112.58s)]
*  That's why you did a good job. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1115.3s)]
*  What do you say, what do we want? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1117.4599999999998s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1118.26s)]
*  That's a debate. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1118.82s)]
*  That's the nature of a debate. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1119.3799999999999s)]
*  Listen, that was really good what you did. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1120.4199999999998s)]
*  It was pointless, but it was really good. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1122.26s)]
*  What was the claim? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1124.02s)]
*  Listen, a rap beef is when two rappers will have bars against one another, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1124.82s)]
*  and then the audience will decide which one is more high level than just that. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1128.82s)]
*  That's what we want. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1132.1799999999998s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1132.82s)]
*  What I meant was, what I meant was, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1133.3799999999999s)]
*  what do we want them to actually talk about? [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1135.3799999999999s)]

*  I know that she said one of the funniest things ever, which is when she was saying [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1509.46s)]
*  that Bridget McCraw, which is the president of France's wife, was a man. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1514.3400000000001s)]
*  She said, I will bet my career on this. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1517.7s)]
*  Think of the things you would bet your career on. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1523.14s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1524.9s)]
*  Think about how many of them there are. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1525.6200000000001s)]
*  The reason why I'm laughing at that is y'all ever had to throw garbage into a trash can [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1527.54s)]
*  from far and you're like, if I make this, I get everything I want in my life. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1533.06s)]
*  For something like that. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1536.5800000000002s)]
*  You in your mind bet your career on it and even then your hand is shitting. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1537.38s)]
*  You're like, let me get a little closer. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1541.8600000000001s)]
*  Let me just dunk this thing. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1542.98s)]
*  She bet her career on a story that is 99% probably not true. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1544.4199999999998s)]
*  Maybe the president of France's wife is a pedophile. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1549.9399999999998s)]
*  That, if she's like, I bet my career on that. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1552.98s)]
*  It's more likely. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1554.6599999999999s)]
*  Pretty likely. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1555.54s)]
*  Met the kid when he's 15 or something like that, ends up marrying him. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1556.98s)]
*  That's a little bit goofy. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1559.4599999999998s)]
*  I know in France that's considered ancient. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1560.5s)]
*  Fucking a 15-year-old is very, it's unbelievable patience. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1564.02s)]
*  100%. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1567.9399999999998s)]
*  But still. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1569.06s)]
*  Conversion scale. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1569.6999999999998s)]
*  French 15 is American 38. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1570.4199999999998s)]
*  It's metric. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1571.9399999999998s)]
*  They're operating on Celsius and it is what it is. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1572.98s)]
*  Their numbers are Celsius. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1575.22s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1576.5s)]
*  But to say the president of France's wife is a man I bet my career on. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1577.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1582.5s)]
*  Is, is, is absurd. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1583.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1586.5800000000002s)]
*  Is absurd. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1587.22s)]
*  I guess she was wrong. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1587.94s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1589.22s)]
*  Now we're going to see. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1590.1000000000001s)]
*  We're going to see. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1591.7800000000002s)]
*  Well, she lost her job. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1593.3000000000002s)]
*  She didn't lose her career. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1594.26s)]
*  She didn't lose her career. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1595.22s)]
*  If anything, I think she's bigger. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1596.02s)]
*  I think she's going to pull her dick out. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1597.22s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1598.5800000000002s)]
*  No. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1598.98s)]
*  You're like, we're going to see. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1600.3400000000001s)]
*  I'm like, what is this pay-per-view? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1601.14s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1602.66s)]
*  Nah. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1603.3000000000002s)]
*  I mean, that's how they could stop all the Muslims from coming to France. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1603.78s)]
*  I know that's a big issue, but if they really want to stop it, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1606.9s)]
*  I mean, that is a great move right there. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1610.5800000000002s)]
*  You just market that. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1612.26s)]
*  Like, you sure you want to come to this country? [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1613.5400000000002s)]
*  We're all gay. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1614.9s)]
*  I mean, that is a strategy. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1617.22s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1618.5s)]
*  Yeah, no, I just found it funny because she's like, miss, uh, pull yourself up by your bootstraps [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1619.3000000000002s)]
*  and don't ask for handouts. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1623.94s)]
*  And then the moment she gets fired, she's asking for donations. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1625.14s)]
*  Like, I just found that so hypocritical. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1628.8200000000002s)]
*  No way. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1630.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1630.8200000000002s)]
*  Like, she's asking for donations. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1631.6200000000001s)]
*  Really? [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1634.82s)]
*  Does she have her own platform now or something? [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1636.82s)]
*  I think she's trying to, you know, keep her platform going. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1638.5s)]
*  Ah, I mean, listen, she's like, here's the thing with her. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1642.58s)]
*  She does not give a fuck. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1645.6200000000001s)]
*  We all talk about, like, saying whatever the fuck you want. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1647.8600000000001s)]
*  Candice lives that shit. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1651.22s)]
*  I don't say whatever the fuck I want. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1652.5s)]
*  She does. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1653.8600000000001s)]
*  She lives that shit. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1654.42s)]
*  So the only way that you can live that shit and make money is if you have donations. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1656.74s)]
*  I think that you get to a certain point of salaciousness that brands are going to be [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1661.46s)]
*  scared and brands. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1668.42s)]
*  And that is, it could be, and that's why I want to see them talk. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1670.1000000000001s)]
*  That could be the reason for the firing. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1673.06s)]
*  The reason for the firing, I think we've all assumed that it was the Israel-Palestine [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1674.9s)]
*  stuff because she's been going hard. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1679.3s)]
*  And Ben has been outspoken about that as well. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1681.14s)]
*  But if it's because of this journalism that he was like, yo, what the fuck are we publishing? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1683.54s)]
*  The president's wife is a, is a man. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1687.7s)]
*  The French president's wife is a man. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1690.1s)]
*  That could change the discourse. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1691.6999999999998s)]
*  Now, I don't know why Ben wouldn't have just said that in the first place. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1693.6999999999998s)]
*  The fact that he didn't makes me go, hmm. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1696.58s)]
*  You know, but I don't know. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1699.54s)]
*  But yeah, I would like to see them talk. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1700.8999999999999s)]
*  Moderate it. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1702.4199999999998s)]
*  God. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1704.02s)]
*  Yeah, I would love to see Schultz moderate it because he would just be inflammatory. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1705.62s)]

*  It looks like he was. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1751.86s)]
*  Because she says that this was a planned trip that she was supposed to be in London. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1752.8999999999999s)]
*  And the Daily Wire was aware of it. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1757.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1758.82s)]
*  Oh, sorry, it was mainly Daily Wire. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1759.3799999999999s)]
*  Daily Wire was like, oh, Candice wasn't pump faking. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1761.3s)]
*  She's like, yo, let's set it up, let's do it. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1763.2199999999998s)]
*  I just don't want to do it on your guys' platform, which I think is a very fair thing, right? [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1764.82s)]
*  You would do it on a neutral site. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1769.6999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1770.82s)]
*  But the Daily Wire was like, yeah, let's do it Monday. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1771.3s)]
*  And it's just like, you know I'm in London Monday. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1774.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1775.4599999999998s)]

*  And then I was part of your company and you knew about my schedules. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1778.42s)]
*  And maybe they didn't know about the schedules, but once she says that, you have to relinquish. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1781.62s)]
*  I think Vanell also had a tweet that was like this, one of his guys on his team was like, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1787.1399999999999s)]
*  this is what we're offering, take it or leave it. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1790.42s)]
*  I think they used the words take it or leave it, which is the back and forth is like annoying. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1792.1s)]
*  But yeah, fair enough. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1795.94s)]
*  It seems like they were trying to be like, let's put it into a specific thing we know she can make. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1797.7s)]
*  So she looks bad and we look good. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1801.86s)]
*  We don't have to debate. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1803.1399999999999s)]

*  Shout out to these guys. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1993.62s)]
*  You seem like chill dudes. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1995.1399999999999s)]
*  Their content I see every single time I open up Instagram, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=1997.3s)]
*  they have every conspiracy absolutely locked the fuck down. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2000.82s)]
*  I'm sure that they have a long form podcast. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2004.4199999999998s)]
*  I have not listened to long form yet, but they're killing it. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2006.26s)]
*  I'm on social and it's awesome. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2009.06s)]
*  It is just like 60 seconds of absolute heat. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2011.7s)]
*  Literally just absorb your whole next hour of your day. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2015.78s)]
*  I guess there are giants. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2019.94s)]
*  They're just walking around. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2022.1799999999998s)]
*  But this is the one that I saw that kind of piqued my interest. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2024.34s)]
*  I was like, oh shit. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2026.82s)]
*  And then I saw it percolating everywhere. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2027.46s)]
*  And then it got picked up by like CBS and big news companies are talking about this. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2028.74s)]
*  So basically, the Jews want to build a third temple. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2034.5s)]
*  Third temple. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2038.02s)]
*  The first one was Temple of David. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2038.66s)]
*  Destroyed by the Babylonians. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2041.14s)]
*  Fucking Babylonians. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2042.5800000000002s)]
*  The next one destroyed by the Romans, I think, or Herod or some shit. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2043.6200000000001s)]
*  70 AD. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2046.8200000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2047.7s)]
*  It's been a long time. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2048.34s)]
*  They want to rebuild the third one. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2049.46s)]
*  That will basically usher in their Messiah. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2050.9s)]
*  They don't have a Messiah yet, right? [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2054.1s)]
*  So in order to build the temple, they need a red heifer. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2056.58s)]
*  Can I ask you one question real quick? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2060.02s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2061.38s)]
*  Their Messiah. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2062.7400000000002s)]
*  Is that Jesus? [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2064.58s)]
*  Are they supposed to be Jesus? [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2065.78s)]
*  No. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2067.06s)]
*  According to me. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2067.38s)]
*  But they need someone else to come through. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2068.7400000000002s)]
*  And some Jews believe that this guy, I forget his name, I think it's the Lebavitch Jews. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2071.7000000000003s)]
*  They believe that that guy's already showed up. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2077.46s)]
*  Yeah, the rabbi. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2079.86s)]
*  Yes. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2081.2200000000003s)]
*  And he's going to come back. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2081.54s)]
*  Yep. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2082.34s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2082.9s)]
*  He is past already, but they think he's going to come back. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2083.78s)]
*  Yes. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2086.34s)]
*  That he was in like human form as the rebbe and he's going to come back as the Messiah. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2087.1400000000003s)]
*  But that's just one sect of Jews. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2091.46s)]
*  Ultra-orthodox, yeah. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2093.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2094.5s)]
*  Okay, so they believe in the death and reincarnation. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2095.22s)]
*  Dick biters. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2098.8199999999997s)]
*  That's how you know Christ is king, son. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2100.66s)]
*  Because you heard the story. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2102.74s)]
*  What you going to have Christmas next? [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2103.62s)]
*  What else y'all want? [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2105.14s)]
*  Y'all want Easter too? [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2105.8599999999997s)]
*  Fuck out of here, y'all. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2106.98s)]
*  Get your own story. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2107.9399999999996s)]
*  Modernize it. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2108.8199999999997s)]
*  Get your own story. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2109.3799999999997s)]
*  Turn them in cheek. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2110.66s)]
*  We're not doing that. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2111.3799999999997s)]
*  Turn them in cheek. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2112.18s)]
*  We're not doing that. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2112.5s)]
*  Come on. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2113.3799999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2114.18s)]
*  So basically, they need a red heifer. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2114.98s)]
*  A red heifer is literally a red cow. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2116.98s)]
*  And this is a cow that has all these super specific things. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2119.9399999999996s)]
*  And they need to sacrifice the heifer in order to basically do a ritual ceremony to then purify [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2122.66s)]
*  all the people building the temple and purify all the tools building the temple. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2127.54s)]
*  Gotcha. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2130.5s)]
*  And where are they going to build the temple? [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2130.98s)]
*  Great question, no one asked. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2132.34s)]
*  They're going to build it on the temple mount. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2133.46s)]
*  Oh no! [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2136.5s)]
*  A fight's out! [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2137.94s)]
*  I'm not going to punch you! [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2142.34s)]
*  That's basically it. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2144.8199999999997s)]
*  Put your hands up! [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2145.62s)]
*  Oh no! [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2148.02s)]
*  Because why is that tricky? [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2149.38s)]
*  Because the temple mount is... [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2150.98s)]
*  Controlled and basically has a mosque on it and controlled by the Muslims in the Middle East. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2152.58s)]
*  And it has been for a couple of years. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2156.66s)]
*  Well, not in the Middle East. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2158.02s)]
*  It's in Jerusalem. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2158.9s)]
*  In Jerusalem, yeah. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2159.7s)]
*  On the Palestinian side. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2160.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2162.18s)]
*  I believe it's Al Aqsa, right? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2162.66s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2165.38s)]
*  So Al Aqsa... [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2166.1s)]
*  They want to take more land? [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2166.66s)]
*  One little thing! [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2169.3s)]
*  One little thing! [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2170.5s)]
*  Give them 30 feet! [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2172.34s)]
*  They need to go 30 feet! [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2174.26s)]
*  They just want the Northex, dude. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2175.62s)]
*  They don't even want the whole thing. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2176.82s)]
*  I'm not going to lie, bro. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2177.46s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2178.42s)]
*  In Jerusalem, bro, we went underneath... [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2180.02s)]
*  Oh, sorry. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2182.2599999999998s)]
*  We went underneath... [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2182.98s)]
*  We went underneath the... [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2185.14s)]
*  The... [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2187.86s)]
*  What was down there, bro? [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2192.5s)]
*  Maybe hook and tunnel. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2193.14s)]
*  You got a mattress down there? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2193.7799999999997s)]
*  Super was it! [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2194.58s)]
*  And you know who was building them? [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2195.22s)]
*  They had Palestinians building them. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2196.9s)]
*  So that's where they learned. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2198.42s)]
*  That's what the Palestinians learned! [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2200.18s)]
*  Fuck up! [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2201.94s)]
*  Fuck around! [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2202.42s)]
*  Find out! [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2202.9s)]
*  It's an away game. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2203.22s)]
*  But I remember us going... [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2205.14s)]
*  And basically what they've done is... [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2206.42s)]
*  In order to get your prayers up to God, [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2208.42s)]
*  the closest place to God, I believe, is [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2210.66s)]
*  in the prayer section of the Temple Mount. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2213.94s)]
*  So that is where God comes and answers all your prayers. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2217.78s)]
*  That is my understanding. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2220.98s)]
*  And I think that's why when you're at the Kotel, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2224.26s)]
*  you know that the Wailing Wall, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2226.26s)]
*  where they put the little piece of paper, [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2227.86s)]
*  that's as close as they can get to the Temple Mount. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2229.38s)]
*  So you put your... [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2232.58s)]
*  And you're like, okay, I'm pretty close. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2233.3s)]
*  Maybe God is going to read the little paper. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2234.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's like dial-up. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2236.6600000000003s)]
*  Yes, dial-up. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2237.6200000000003s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2238.5800000000004s)]
*  But you want ethernet. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2239.0600000000004s)]
*  You want to be plugged in. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2239.94s)]
*  So there is an underground passageway [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2241.94s)]
*  that they've been excavating, right? [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2244.9s)]
*  So you basically are going underneath [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2247.0600000000004s)]
*  and you're getting really close to the Temple Mount. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2249.78s)]
*  Now, they're not like directly under the Temple Mount, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2253.2200000000003s)]
*  but you're like as close as they legally can. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2255.46s)]
*  And I remember being under there and I was like... [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2258.34s)]
*  This is egregious, guys. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2262.42s)]
*  Like you're really pushing it, right? [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2264.66s)]
*  It's like you can't go on top of the land to it, [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2267.2999999999997s)]
*  but they're going underneath. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2269.62s)]
*  It feels a little bit like you're like [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2271.06s)]
*  a little sibling being like, I'm not touching you. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2272.4199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, great. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2274.02s)]
*  You're bugging me though. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2275.8599999999997s)]
*  Yes, yes, 100%. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2276.66s)]
*  Okay, okay, back to your story. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2279.62s)]
*  So basically... [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2280.8199999999997s)]
*  Not a story, it's the facts. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2281.62s)]
*  Basically, they need a red heifer [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2283.06s)]
*  and they need to combine the ashes of the red heifer [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2284.58s)]
*  with the previous nine red heifers, okay? [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2286.58s)]
*  The last red heifer to be sacrificed in this way [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2288.8199999999997s)]
*  was 2,000 years ago. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2290.74s)]
*  So that's where things have left off. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2292.5s)]
*  That's the prophecy, okay? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2294.02s)]
*  They need eight before that, right? [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2295.1400000000003s)]
*  No, no, no, they've already had nine. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2296.5s)]
*  They need to do one more, okay? [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2298.9s)]
*  Now, this site is obviously important for everyone. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2301.3s)]
*  It's important for Christians, [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2303.1400000000003s)]
*  it's important for Muslims, obviously. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2304.26s)]
*  Why is it important for Christians? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2305.78s)]
*  I mean, I think it's just one... [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2307.38s)]
*  Sermon on the Mount, right? [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2308.98s)]
*  Basically, if they rebuild the Temple, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2310.02s)]
*  evangelical Christians specifically, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2312.6600000000003s)]
*  but I think generally all Christians, I guess, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2314.42s)]
*  believe that that's when the Messiah will return, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2316.1800000000003s)]
*  when Jesus comes back. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2319.2200000000003s)]
*  So we're kind of like... [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2320.26s)]
*  So evangelicals are in on it. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2322.5800000000004s)]
*  They want that shit to pop off. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2324.82s)]
*  I think Sermon on the Mount is where Jesus said, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2325.94s)]
*  turn the other cheek or whatever the fuck. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2327.6200000000003s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2329.5400000000004s)]
*  I shouldn't say fuck my bad, but yeah, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2329.94s)]
*  we're turning the other cheek. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2331.3s)]
*  It's all good, bro. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2331.94s)]
*  Forgive, forgive, forgive. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2332.7400000000002s)]
*  I'll turn the other cheek on that one. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2333.86s)]
*  Say it again. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2334.98s)]
*  Say it again, bro. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2335.78s)]
*  Forgive. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2336.5800000000004s)]
*  But Muslims care about it [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2339.6200000000003s)]
*  because that's where Muhammad praised be upon him, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2340.7400000000002s)]
*  went to heaven. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2343.0600000000004s)]
*  Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2343.78s)]
*  That's debatable, bro. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2346.26s)]
*  I'm not going to debate that. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2347.94s)]
*  I'm just saying it's debatable. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2348.82s)]
*  I don't fuck with Muslims, bro. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2350.6600000000003s)]
*  That's debatable. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2351.94s)]
*  I'll make fun of Jews. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2353.0600000000004s)]
*  I'll make fun of Jews. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2354.26s)]
*  I'll make fun of Jews. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2355.2200000000003s)]
*  While we're on public record, Muslims... [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2355.7000000000003s)]
*  I don't make fun of Muslims. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2356.82s)]
*  You're 100% right. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2357.78s)]
*  What some people say is that Muhammad went there in a dream [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2359.6200000000003s)]
*  that he himself never arrived at Al-Aqsa, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2363.78s)]
*  but he went there in his dream. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2366.5s)]
*  And you believe that? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2367.94s)]
*  Well, I mean, that's whatever Jews ever told me. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2368.7400000000002s)]
*  Now, the Muslims are like, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2370.6600000000003s)]
*  now he pulled up, bro. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2371.7000000000003s)]
*  He rolled up with the donkey. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2372.7400000000002s)]
*  You know, they was chilling in there. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2374.26s)]
*  The gaslighting, dude. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2375.38s)]
*  The gaslighting. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2376.6600000000003s)]
*  It was a dream. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2377.46s)]
*  It was a dream. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2378.26s)]
*  But how do we know who's right, who's wrong? [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2379.7s)]
*  It's so many years have passed. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2383.22s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2384.74s)]
*  Who's telling the truth? [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2386.2599999999998s)]
*  The side you're afraid of seems like they, right? [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2387.22s)]
*  Which side? [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2390.18s)]
*  I'm afraid of all of them. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2390.9s)]
*  Okay? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2393.7s)]
*  It's the only the Christians I'm not afraid of. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2394.18s)]
*  That's why Christians need to rule the world [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2395.94s)]
*  so that we can not live in fear. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2398.1s)]
*  We're afraid of all of them. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2400.98s)]
*  So the red heifer has to be perfect, okay? [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2402.9s)]
*  It has to be perfect in its redness. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2404.8199999999997s)]
*  Two hairs of any other color will disqualify it. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2406.5s)]
*  Even the foes have to be red. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2408.42s)]
*  It has to be three or four years old. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2409.78s)]
*  Other older animals won't be able to be sacrificed. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2411.14s)]
*  There can't be any kind of internal or external defect [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2416.02s)]
*  or blemish. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2418.7400000000002s)]
*  They can't have been yoked, done any physical labor, [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2419.2200000000003s)]
*  even had a person lean on it. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2421.2200000000003s)]
*  They can't even have had a blanket put on it. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2422.66s)]
*  So basically a couple of rabbis go to an evangelical Texas rancher [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2425.2200000000003s)]
*  and it's basically like, hey, we need your help getting these red heifers. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2429.54s)]
*  Now you need us. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2431.7000000000003s)]
*  They need five. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2432.7400000000002s)]
*  Now you need us. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2433.78s)]
*  They get five of them. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2434.66s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2435.46s)]
*  All perfect. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2436.1s)]
*  No blemishes. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2436.66s)]
*  They get sent over to Israel. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2437.46s)]
*  Now they're in Israel right now. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2439.38s)]
*  They basically built the altar on the Mount of Olives [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2441.2200000000003s)]
*  where they're going to sacrifice the heifer. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2443.86s)]
*  This is where it gets a little wild. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2446.66s)]
*  Apparently a Hamas spokesperson claims, this happened in 2022, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2448.18s)]
*  a Hamas spokesperson claims that part of the reason [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2452.18s)]
*  that October 7th happened was because of the red heifers. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2455.3s)]
*  I was like, there's no way that's true. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2457.78s)]
*  I Googled it. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2459.14s)]
*  Apparently the dude was like, yeah, the red heifer thing was. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2459.7s)]
*  I mean, how hard is it to be a Hamas spokesperson? [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2462.1s)]
*  That's a great. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2464.82s)]
*  I mean, I feel like at this time, you could just raise your hand. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2467.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I'm doing PR for Hamas. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2470.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2472.58s)]
*  They could use the help. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2473.2200000000003s)]
*  I mean, if anyone wants to pick up a PR job, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2474.02s)]
*  that's probably a good one to take on. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2476.26s)]
*  Easily. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2477.54s)]
*  I mean, they can't do it. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2478.5s)]
*  They're playing fucking Super Mario Bros. right now. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2479.46s)]
*  They are. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2484.26s)]
*  They're in the plumbing. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2485.78s)]
*  Aren't they? [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2487.46s)]
*  I guess. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2488.26s)]
*  Okay. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2488.82s)]
*  I mean, if you really want to get them out of there, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2489.7000000000003s)]
*  you just start playing. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2490.98s)]
*  Okay. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2494.98s)]
*  So. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2495.48s)]
*  But yeah. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2496.1000000000004s)]
*  So basically they see it like, okay, if you get the red heifers here, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2496.6600000000003s)]
*  that means you're trying to make a move on the Temple Mount. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2500.02s)]
*  That means you're trying to take our shit. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2501.86s)]
*  So we got to buck up and that's going to create more conflict. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2503.2200000000003s)]
*  So as ridiculous as this seems maybe to us, these are all believers. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2505.38s)]
*  They all believe. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2510.5s)]
*  So if you believe the prophecy and keep in mind, these are all Abrahamic religions. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2510.82s)]
*  So the latest one has to believe the stuff before. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2514.7400000000002s)]
*  So Muslims have to believe in Christians. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2518.26s)]
*  Christians have to believe in Jews. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2520.34s)]
*  Jews don't really have to believe in the future ones. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2522.66s)]
*  But when they need some red heifers, who the fuck they come to? [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2525.3799999999997s)]
*  The fucking Texans. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2528.5s)]
*  The boys. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2531.06s)]
*  The boys. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2532.8199999999997s)]
*  Texans, brother. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2533.7799999999997s)]
*  Turbo. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2534.58s)]
*  Turbo. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2535.54s)]
*  Hey there, brother. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2536.74s)]
*  I've got some fat bitches from San Antonio for you, brother. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2538.5s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2542.58s)]
*  So it's all heating up. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2543.06s)]
*  Apparently they're going to sacrifice the red heifer during Passover, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2544.18s)]
*  which is in like a week. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2547.14s)]
*  And then their Messiah will come. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2548.8199999999997s)]
*  No, because they don't have the Temple Mount. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2550.42s)]
*  It's going to start the end times. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2551.78s)]
*  Once they sacrifice the red heifer, then they can start getting the tools and the people to build [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2553.3s)]
*  the new Temple. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2557.38s)]
*  Then they want the end times. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2557.5400000000004s)]
*  Well, they want to get the Messiah popping. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2558.98s)]
*  And the Messiah is a messenger of death, it seems. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2560.82s)]
*  No, this is salvation for the Jewish people. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2564.02s)]
*  For the Jews, for the chosen ones. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2566.34s)]
*  For the chosen, this is the end of the prophecy. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2568.1800000000003s)]
*  They get to actually do whatever their prophecy says. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2569.86s)]
*  Seems a little selfish. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2572.5s)]
*  Stupid. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2574.6600000000003s)]
*  Seems a little selfish. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2575.3s)]
*  Hindus are involved? [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2576.26s)]
*  They're sacrificing your uncle? [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2577.86s)]
*  That's right. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2580.5s)]
*  That red heifer. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2581.46s)]
*  That red heifer could be related to you. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2583.38s)]
*  Somewhere, right? [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2585.2200000000003s)]
*  I mean, maybe in like a thousand lives ago. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2586.1s)]
*  But I'm just saying there's what, 15 million Jews? [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2588.18s)]
*  Dude, can I ask you a serious question? [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2591.2200000000003s)]
*  You're going to end the whole world for 15 million of you? [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2592.1s)]
*  There's 8 billion people. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2593.62s)]
*  Have Jews been known to be extremely considerate? [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2594.98s)]
*  I'm just saying. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2598.26s)]
*  How is the temperature for you guys? [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2599.94s)]
*  We'll keep it there. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2601.06s)]
*  Now question. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2604.18s)]
*  Because you guys believe in reincarnation, [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2607.38s)]
*  are you more accepting of bestiality? [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2609.54s)]
*  Okay, so I can move on to the next part of this. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2613.14s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2615.62s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2616.98s)]
*  But. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2619.86s)]
*  It happens. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2620.82s)]
*  I mean, y'all got that video of the guy getting fucked by the horse. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2621.38s)]
*  But he doesn't put love in the game, I think. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2624.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, he's doing it for the horse. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2625.94s)]
*  Like, he doesn't feel good from that. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2628.1s)]
*  He just thought the horse needed to get that off. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2629.86s)]
*  He didn't have confidence in his hand game. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2632.34s)]
*  Mr. Hands. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2635.38s)]
*  But he's gay. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2636.98s)]
*  He wants to get fucked in his ass by the biggest dick possible. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2637.78s)]
*  So he goes horse. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2639.78s)]
*  We don't know if he's gay. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2640.42s)]
*  Why are you assuming he's gay? [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2641.2200000000003s)]
*  That's pretty gay. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2642.02s)]

*  That's not. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2645.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, horses. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2645.6200000000003s)]
*  The horse, there's no gender. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2646.5800000000004s)]
*  It's just horse. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2648.6600000000003s)]
*  I know, I know. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2649.38s)]
*  That horse had a gender. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2649.94s)]
*  No, but it's not a gender. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2651.3s)]
*  It's horse. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2652.5s)]

*  Can you moderate here? [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2656.7400000000002s)]
*  We need to moderate. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2657.6200000000003s)]

*  That's what he needs to be. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2672.74s)]
*  OK, so. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2673.62s)]
*  All they got to do is just lean up against his horse [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2674.98s)]
*  and now you just disqualify all these horses. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2677.06s)]
*  Yeah, you don't have to put a blanket on him. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2678.34s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2680.58s)]

*  No way. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2684.26s)]
*  Literally, it's being guarded within a specific building. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2685.14s)]
*  It's being protected. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2687.62s)]

*  That's right. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2750.9s)]
*  And it was really hard for him and his wife to conceive. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2751.38s)]
*  And then they finally conceived. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2753.06s)]

*  But I mean, Noah had a backup plan. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2763.2200000000003s)]
*  That's true. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2765.62s)]
*  Noah had one plan. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2766.42s)]
*  Well, it was like, you could die here or you could get on the boat. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2768.02s)]
*  But it wasn't backup. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2770.7400000000002s)]
*  It was like, I know this thing is going to happen. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2771.62s)]
*  I have so much faith that this thing is going to happen. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2772.98s)]
*  So I have to build this boat. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2774.6600000000003s)]
*  So maybe billions of dollars of missiles is the, that's the boat. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2775.78s)]
*  Well, then you don't believe in the Red Heifers. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2779.46s)]
*  Well, no, the Red Heifers are going to bring it in. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2782.5s)]
*  But then you've got to have the ammo to back it up. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2784.1s)]
*  They would say that millions of dollars, billions of dollars or whatever, [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2787.14s)]
*  would protect the Red Heifers so we can do this. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2789.7s)]
*  Otherwise. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2792.66s)]
*  Got it. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2793.06s)]
*  It's been 2,000 years. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2793.78s)]
*  Got it. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2794.82s)]
*  Got it. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2795.3s)]
*  Otherwise, it's Hamas animals. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2795.86s)]
*  I get it. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2797.94s)]
*  I get it. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2798.5s)]
*  I get what you're saying. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2798.98s)]
*  OK. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2800.18s)]
*  So evangelicals are on board with it. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2800.5s)]
*  Jews are on board with it. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2802.26s)]
*  Evangelicals and Jews are just fucking linked in. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2803.3s)]
*  The rancher that they found to get this was like, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2806.26s)]
*  yeah, man, I feel like I'm doing my purpose right now. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2808.1s)]
*  Wow. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2810.02s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2810.5s)]
*  But it's really interesting because it's mutually assured destruction of each other. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2811.22s)]
*  So the Christians are doing it because, yo, Jesus is coming back [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2815.94s)]
*  and he's killing all these Jews and anybody else and we're going to have it. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2819.46s)]
*  And the Jews are doing it because they're like, [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2822.66s)]
*  our guys come in and he's killing all these Christians, whatever. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2824.58s)]
*  So they're both gambling on the same thing. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2827.22s)]
*  Evangelicals would say like, every knee will bend when they see the true light of Christ. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2830.1s)]
*  And what did you say? [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2833.7s)]
*  Jews are like, you guys are dead. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2834.9s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2841.6200000000003s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2843.6200000000003s)]
*  I want to do this as like a dinner theater. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2845.2200000000003s)]
*  I want to do medieval time. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2846.98s)]
*  But it's every different religion. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2848.26s)]
*  You get to pick one and they play it all out. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2849.46s)]
*  You're dead and you're going to hell. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2851.38s)]
*  You're not just dead. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2852.7400000000002s)]
*  You're going to hell. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2853.54s)]
*  Some Jews don't believe in hell. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2855.06s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2856.5s)]
*  We're going to talk to the Jews. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2856.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think they believe in it. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2857.7000000000003s)]
*  That's good. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2859.78s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2860.7400000000002s)]
*  So it's kind of that part's considerate. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2861.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2863.38s)]
*  It's hard enough to be Jewish [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2864.3399999999997s)]
*  that they don't feel like you should be tortured in the afterlife as well. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2866.5s)]
*  What the hell is just living as a Jewish person? [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2871.2999999999997s)]
*  Every second of every day, constantly analyzing everything around. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2874.3399999999997s)]
*  Discomfort. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2877.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2877.86s)]
*  So there's one part of this. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2880.1s)]
*  They have to mix the red heifer, the current sacrifice, [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2881.38s)]
*  with the other red heifers from 2000 years ago. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2884.1s)]
*  Mix them, meaning the ashes. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2886.9s)]
*  They have to mix the ashes. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2887.94s)]
*  And where do they find the ashes of the older ones? [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2888.74s)]
*  They don't have. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2891.14s)]
*  Psych. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2892.5s)]
*  They're inside. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2893.38s)]
*  You fucking got you so bad. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2894.5s)]
*  You really thought that was it. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2896.34s)]
*  You fucking idiot. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2897.38s)]
*  Was it adorable? [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2897.78s)]
*  Yeah, that was adorable. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2898.42s)]
*  It's called drama, guys. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2900.42s)]
*  That was so. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2901.6200000000003s)]
*  We'll edit it. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2902.1800000000003s)]
*  Go, go, go. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2902.6600000000003s)]
*  That was sick. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2903.78s)]
*  Go, go, go. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2904.34s)]
*  That was awesome. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2904.7400000000002s)]
*  Where they found the Dead Sea Scrolls, [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2905.46s)]
*  they also found a clay pot full of ashes. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2906.82s)]
*  Of red heifers? [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2909.38s)]
*  Of red heifers. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2910.34s)]
*  There's no way that they could look at the biology [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2911.1400000000003s)]
*  and find out that they're red heifers. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2913.2200000000003s)]
*  This is so fucked. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2914.5800000000004s)]
*  How do we know it's not Jesus' ashes? [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2915.94s)]
*  So it all occurs here. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2917.46s)]
*  So how do we know it's not a... [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2918.42s)]
*  They found the ashes of the red heifers. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2919.6200000000003s)]
*  A baba ganoush. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2920.7400000000002s)]
*  A long time ago, if we look it up, [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2922.5s)]
*  it might be some ash to eggplant. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2924.9s)]
*  Wait, so we're just not going to look into it [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2926.9s)]
*  and just hope it's red heifers? [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2928.34s)]
*  Shh. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2929.46s)]
*  And then we're going to mix it? [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2929.86s)]
*  They found the ashes of the red heifers [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2930.82s)]
*  in the Dead Sea Scrolls. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2932.2599999999998s)]
*  Holy fuck. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2933.22s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2933.7799999999997s)]
*  Holy fuck. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2935.22s)]
*  Out here, dude. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2936.5s)]
*  Yo, can you answer something real quick? [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2938.02s)]
*  I can't. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2940.5s)]
*  Can you answer something real quick? [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2940.9s)]
*  What is... [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2942.5s)]
*  Hey, Alex, can you fucking learn something? [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2943.38s)]
*  Yeah, I'm trying. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2945.3s)]
*  We're the real Jews. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2946.58s)]
*  You don't even listen one time. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2947.38s)]
*  I tell you what I'm going to do. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2948.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2948.9s)]
*  Motherfucker. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2949.46s)]
*  Come on, listen. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2950.02s)]
*  I am the lost tribe. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2952.18s)]
*  You guys are just the late tribe. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2954.66s)]
*  What are they? [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2957.7s)]
*  Basically, I think it's like the Apocrypha. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2959.22s)]
*  It's basically like old gospels. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2961.3s)]
*  It's like gospels that talk about Jesus [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2963.46s)]
*  and the fucking Jews. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2966.18s)]
*  These are our books or are these the Jew books [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2968.66s)]
*  or these are Muzzy books? [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2970.58s)]
*  I think they're our books plus... [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2972.18s)]
*  I think it's Christian. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2974.98s)]
*  Okay, so it's the good guys. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2975.86s)]
*  You found the good guys. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2977.86s)]
*  It's the good guys. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2978.74s)]
*  You got the good guys. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2979.3s)]
*  Okay. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2979.94s)]
*  Okay. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2980.9s)]
*  Can I get a fact check? [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2981.22s)]
*  Shifty, we have one actual Christian in the room. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2983.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2986.2599999999998s)]
*  Can you tell us what the Dead Sea Scrolls are? [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2987.22s)]
*  Mic them up. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2989.8599999999997s)]
*  Mic them up. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2991.54s)]
*  We're not silencing Christians on this podcast. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2992.18s)]
*  Go. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2995.4599999999996s)]
*  I'm pretty sure it's just a collection of both books. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2995.7799999999997s)]
*  It's like Jews and Christians. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=2998.74s)]
*  And it's like because we both read some of the same books. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3000.66s)]
*  That's what I would have to guess. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3003.54s)]
*  And is it talking about Jesus? [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3004.74s)]
*  Yeah, I think some of them are gospels. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3007.06s)]
*  I'm pretty sure. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3008.66s)]
*  And it's like the oldest one we ever found. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3009.22s)]
*  I found it, brother. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3011.54s)]
*  40% of the copies are texts of Hebrew scriptures. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3013.7s)]
*  Other 30% are texts from the Second Temple Period [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3016.1s)]
*  which were not canonized in the Hebrew Bible [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3018.3399999999997s)]
*  like the Book of Enoch, Book of Jubilee, Book of Tobit, [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3020.1s)]
*  the Wisdom of Sirach, Psalms 152 through 155. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3022.8199999999997s)]
*  The remainder, 30%, are sectarian manuscripts [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3025.9399999999996s)]
*  of previously unknown documents that shed light [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3028.3399999999997s)]
*  on the rules and beliefs of the particular sect [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3030.5s)]
*  or groups within greater Judaism [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3032.8199999999997s)]
*  like Community Rule, Habakkuk, [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3034.8199999999997s)]
*  the Rule of Blessings, and the Warschroll. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3036.5s)]
*  You're going to have to explain that again, brother. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3038.66s)]
*  I caught none of that. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3040.5s)]
*  I understood maybe 50% of that. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3041.3s)]
*  Okay, fine. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3043.14s)]
*  I thought that was it. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3043.94s)]
*  You said Tibet and Enoch and I just shut off, brother. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3044.42s)]
*  Let me hit it one more time. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3046.74s)]
*  I heard Habakkuk. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3047.7s)]
*  It's about 10% luck, 20% skill, 50% concentrated power of will. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3048.2599999999998s)]
*  There you go. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3053.78s)]
*  It's just like scriptures and then... [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3054.18s)]
*  I think it's all Jewish stuff. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3056.34s)]
*  Well, no, because like Psalms and shit like that. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3058.1s)]
*  Book of Enoch. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3060.2599999999998s)]
*  Enoch is Jewish, dog. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3061.14s)]
*  Come on. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3062.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3062.98s)]
*  Enoch's like Mark's mom's shit. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3063.78s)]
*  Enoch's like a completely different thing. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3066.5s)]
*  Red Pill? [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3069.2999999999997s)]
*  No, it's like pre-Bible. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3070.66s)]
*  Don't they talk about aliens and shit in Enoch? [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3073.54s)]
*  Yeah, your mom, me and your mom... [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3075.14s)]
*  Oh, the Nephilim. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3076.8199999999997s)]
*  Oh, that's the Giants. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3078.18s)]
*  The Giants. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3079.22s)]
*  See, we're back on the Giants. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3079.7s)]
*  I love Giants. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3080.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3081.7s)]
*  They had Giants back in the day. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3082.74s)]
*  Did you? [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3084.42s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3086.18s)]
*  We got Jinder Mahal. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3086.74s)]
*  We doing it. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3087.7s)]
*  So yeah. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3090.58s)]
*  And then we had the eclipse on top of all that. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3091.14s)]
*  Full totality over the town of Nineveh. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3095.7s)]
*  Why does that matter? [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3097.94s)]
*  Because Nineveh is the place where Jonah went and was like, [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3099.54s)]
*  hey, it's going to be dark. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3102.1s)]
*  After 40 days of darkness, [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3102.98s)]
*  judgment is going to come unless you all repent. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3104.2599999999998s)]
*  Son, he could kill me now you keep telling this story. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3106.1s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3108.2599999999998s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3108.74s)]
*  Let judgment come. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3108.98s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3109.7s)]
*  Hold on, hold on. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3110.42s)]
*  I'm locked in. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3110.98s)]
*  Go on. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3111.54s)]
*  So this one, I don't know, I don't really think this makes as much sense. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3113.22s)]
*  But basically they're saying full totality across the United States over seven towns of Nineveh. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3117.14s)]
*  Back in the Bible, Jonah went to the people of Nineveh and was like, [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3121.94s)]
*  hey, it's going to be dark tomorrow. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3124.9s)]
*  And then you have 40 days from that moment to repent. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3126.58s)]
*  If you don't repent, the day of judgment will be upon you. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3130.1s)]
*  They all repented and they spared the day of judgment. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3132.6600000000003s)]
*  But what you're saying is what happened yesterday [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3135.2200000000003s)]
*  was the exact same solar eclipse that happened back in the day. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3138.42s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3143.46s)]
*  Can I tell you something very quickly? [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3144.7400000000002s)]
*  Please. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3147.06s)]
*  Sure. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3147.7000000000003s)]
*  Did you even have to wear glasses yesterday? [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3149.54s)]
*  Okay. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3152.26s)]
*  All right. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3154.6600000000003s)]
*  Hold on, hold on. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3155.3s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3156.5800000000004s)]
*  Hold on, hold on. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3157.46s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3157.86s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3158.5800000000004s)]
*  Oh, that's so funny. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3159.38s)]
*  Alex, Alex, Alex, calm down, Alex. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3160.7400000000002s)]
*  Alex, calm down. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3163.5400000000004s)]
*  Oh, that got me. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3166.9s)]
*  Okay, no, no. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3167.86s)]
*  Yesterday, all of us saw the eclipse, right? [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3170.34s)]
*  That's funny. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3172.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3173.3s)]
*  Okay. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3174.0200000000004s)]
*  My shoulders and nose went across the sun. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3174.1800000000003s)]
*  It is. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3175.7799999999997s)]
*  So basically, I was looking at the eclipse for I would say about maybe three minutes, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3181.46s)]
*  not directly, but when I started texting the group, I was like, [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3189.14s)]
*  is this shit happening or not? [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3192.74s)]
*  And then y'all kept messaging me these like dark ass pictures where you'd see the sun [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3194.4199999999996s)]
*  and I'd look at the picture and I'd look up and I'd be like, [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3198.18s)]
*  I don't think this is happening. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3200.18s)]
*  Why? [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3201.2999999999997s)]
*  You didn't know the glasses? [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3201.8s)]
*  I didn't know you needed the glasses to see it, right? [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3205.5600000000004s)]
*  And all I'm thinking in that moment is like, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3208.6800000000003s)]
*  how the fuck they saw this back in the day because they didn't have these glasses back in the day. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3210.84s)]
*  Oh, that's a good point. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3215.1600000000003s)]
*  How the hell would they see it? [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3215.96s)]
*  That's a good answer. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3217.4s)]
*  They use shadows. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3218.04s)]
*  What's that? [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3219.2400000000002s)]
*  They use shadows. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3219.8s)]
*  Oh, Miles is very into this. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3220.36s)]
*  They use shadows? [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3221.48s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3222.52s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3223.1600000000003s)]
*  Like if you looked at the shadows. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3224.2000000000003s)]
*  Stop. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3225.0800000000004s)]
*  The calendar. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3225.5600000000004s)]
*  When you said that, do you think we would understand or were you reading from the fucking book of Enoch or whatever? [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3225.8s)]
*  Enoch is alien shit. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3230.44s)]
*  No, they use shadows to see it. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3231.7200000000003s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3233.48s)]
*  Like if you put a colander. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3234.76s)]
*  What if you put a colander? [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3236.1200000000003s)]

*  He's too far. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3238.52s)]
*  I want to J. Cole slap you right now. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3239.1600000000003s)]
*  You're gonna apologize. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3240.84s)]
*  The fuck? [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3241.88s)]
*  If you have a circular hole and it casts a shadow, it'll be the shape of the eclipse. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3243.1600000000003s)]
*  So it'll be crescent shaped. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3249.96s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3251.6400000000003s)]
*  How would they even know it's gonna happen? [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3252.44s)]
*  They don't know when it's coming. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3254.6000000000004s)]
*  Totality gets dark. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3256.04s)]
*  You gotta imagine there's just random people walking around. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3257.32s)]

*  Hold on. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3260.92s)]

*  No. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3262.2s)]
*  You're making so much sense and this guy's driving me crazy. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3262.92s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3265.24s)]
*  This shit happens once in the same situation in the same place like once in 300 years. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3266.12s)]
*  So you're telling me it happened, it got dark out of nowhere during the day and then got light again. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3270.6s)]
*  And they're like, we should figure that out. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3274.2s)]
*  Let's just wait another 300 years. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3275.96s)]
*  Will it happen? [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3277.56s)]
*  Will it happen again? [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3278.04s)]
*  Like there's no way. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3279.24s)]
*  They happen somewhat constantly. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3280.44s)]
*  Every couple of years. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3281.96s)]
*  They're either totality, annular. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3283.0s)]
*  There's all these different types of eclipses. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3284.6s)]
*  They're somewhat trackable. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3286.44s)]
*  There are cultures back in the day that knew about them and there are cultures back in the day that didn't that could track them and predict them. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3287.56s)]
*  I don't believe. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3293.08s)]
*  I think that they had the glasses. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3294.44s)]
*  I think they had the glasses or something or my suspicion was an incredibly cloudy day might block the sun. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3296.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that also. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3303.08s)]
*  You know how we're like, oh my God, we won't be able to see it because of clouds. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3304.92s)]
*  I actually think that might help you see it. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3307.64s)]
*  It was such a beautiful day. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3310.44s)]
*  It was so profound that if you didn't have those sunglasses, you didn't notice any difference. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3311.48s)]
*  Did you look at it? [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3316.12s)]
*  Did you guys trump it? [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3316.76s)]
*  Apologies for making fun of Trump. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3318.6000000000004s)]
*  Of course you're going to do that. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3320.92s)]
*  Remember when Trump looked at the solar eclipse without the glasses and everybody's, oh, we're fucking idiot. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3324.5200000000004s)]
*  But I think he went out without glasses. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3329.7200000000003s)]
*  No, he took them off. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3331.6400000000003s)]
*  Look at it and put it back on. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3332.76s)]
*  I did that like 10 fucking times. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3333.88s)]
*  I did not. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3335.5600000000004s)]
*  You'll be blocked. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3336.6000000000004s)]
*  He's not the first president to do it. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3337.32s)]
*  John Quincy Adams partially blinded himself staring at it. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3339.0s)]
*  That's why I didn't do it. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3341.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I was staring at a solar eclipse. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3342.6000000000004s)]
*  Your eyes are bad enough. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3344.76s)]
*  Why did you just try to make it? [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3345.88s)]
*  No, my shit was fucked up. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3347.08s)]
*  I ain't going to lie. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3348.04s)]
*  Today I even feel it. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3348.76s)]
*  I don't feel good. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3349.8s)]
*  Yeah, this shit kind of goes hard, bro. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3350.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's a fire picture. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3352.92s)]
*  It's a good baron. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3353.96s)]
*  You see the photo of the border patrol? [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3355.4s)]
*  He's got, there's a border patrol guy on the south border and he's got, they're in the path of fatality. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3357.4s)]
*  So he's got three illegal immigrants handcuffed to each other and he's put solar eclipse glasses on them. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3362.28s)]
*  So they can all see? [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3369.6400000000003s)]
*  So they all can see as they're walking back to like the truck. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3370.6s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3372.84s)]

*  I don't think they do tires though. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3406.8399999999997s)]
*  Can I be honest? [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3409.7999999999997s)]

*  Simple as that. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3448.2000000000003s)]

*  You're not. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3459.96s)]

*  OK, all that natural, beautiful flavored air good for your body. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=3600.52s)]

*  He brought this girl to his home thinking she was going to clean it. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4282.44s)]
*  Turns out she's with him. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4286.2s)]
*  What an insane turn of events. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4288.679999999999s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4291.4s)]
*  He didn't think that he was hiring her to a sexual consultant of some sort. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4291.799999999999s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4300.04s)]
*  This is just. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4301.08s)]

*  Yo, shouts. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4303.32s)]
*  He used to cater for what's that comedy club that used to be good? [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4304.04s)]
*  Stand Up New York. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4307.08s)]
*  Ah, yes. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4307.879999999999s)]
*  RIP Stand Up New York. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4308.919999999999s)]
*  I never actually ate it, but I love it. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4310.04s)]
*  What a handsome guy. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4312.04s)]
*  Come on, stop it. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4313.08s)]
*  From Milan. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4314.12s)]
*  Dude, you know what? [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4314.92s)]
*  This is a great relationship. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4315.96s)]
*  What if she's just having a fun little time with the older man? [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4317.24s)]
*  What if the older man is having a fun little time too? [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4320.04s)]
*  Why don't we look at it like that? [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4321.96s)]
*  I approve of this relationship. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4322.92s)]
*  She's 21 years old. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4324.360000000001s)]
*  She is an adult. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4325.56s)]
*  She can go to war, right? [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4326.68s)]
*  That's true. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4328.12s)]
*  She can start an OnlyFans. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4328.84s)]
*  She can go to an island and have sex with a millionaire, and that's okay. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4331.4800000000005s)]
*  We have to accept this. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4336.04s)]
*  Now, we can have empathy for the millionaire and having to watch her make TikToks all day. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4337.24s)]
*  We can have empathy for that. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4342.84s)]
*  You flew out this 21-year-old piece of vagina [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4344.76s)]
*  and she's just driving you fucking insane all day for a week straight. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4348.5199999999995s)]
*  He's paying for it right now. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4353.96s)]
*  He's paying for it right now. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4355.0s)]
*  He's like, never again. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4356.04s)]
*  All the blogs are covering him because she wants to go online. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4357.719999999999s)]
*  Get ready with me while I suck this 65-year-old dick. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4360.599999999999s)]
*  So this is, I think we have to have more empathy for the men in these situations. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4362.84s)]
*  100%. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4368.12s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4368.52s)]
*  I agree with that. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4369.32s)]
*  I agree with that. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4369.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4370.92s)]
*  Okay. That was a good one. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4371.16s)]
*  Okay. What else do we got, guys? [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4372.28s)]
*  You guys want to talk WWE? [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4374.28s)]
*  Yeah, we can talk WWE. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4376.360000000001s)]
*  I got filled. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4377.88s)]
*  So I was seeing the WrestleMania tweets. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4378.4400000000005s)]
*  Were y'all seeing it all day Sunday? [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4379.88s)]
*  I know what's going on. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4381.8s)]
*  My brother loves wrestling. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4382.4400000000005s)]
*  I called him. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4383.400000000001s)]
*  I got like a 30-minute breakdown. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4383.88s)]
*  And these motherfuckers are some of the greatest storytellers in the history, [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4385.64s)]
*  at least in my lifetime. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4391.0s)]
*  Okay, bring it down. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4393.0s)]
*  So this guy named Roman Reigns, he is actually The Rock's cousin. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4394.12s)]
*  It's like a wrestling family, like a lineage. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4397.88s)]
*  WWE for years was trying to build this guy up as like a good guy. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4400.12s)]
*  They make him like John Cena. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4403.32s)]
*  And fans didn't really like him. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4404.92s)]
*  There's also this interesting thing with wrestling fans where like WWE [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4406.76s)]
*  kind of acknowledges it's fake now. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4409.96s)]
*  And the fans kind of analyze it like we analyze like Game of Thrones, like the story. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4411.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4416.12s)]
*  So they're like critical of him. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4417.0s)]
*  They don't really like him. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4418.44s)]
*  COVID happens and then he like over COVID when they're not wrestling develops, [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4419.32s)]
*  he's like, I'm going to develop this bad guy character that's like really nuanced. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4422.599999999999s)]
*  Goes to Vince McMahon is like, either you let me turn heel or I quit. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4426.2s)]
*  Because this shit is not working. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4430.36s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4431.32s)]
*  So he develops this whole like he's like a mafia boss or something. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4431.799999999999s)]
*  And like all of his family that's wrestlers, [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4434.92s)]
*  he still has three cousins wrestling calls it the bloodline. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4436.5199999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4439.24s)]
*  And then people start fucking loving him. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4439.96s)]
*  They're like, yo, this guy, this character is great. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4441.96s)]
*  He becomes champion. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4443.96s)]
*  It's undefeated for four years or holds the belt for four years almost. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4444.759999999999s)]
*  And then The Rock comes back and there's this other guy, [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4448.28s)]
*  Corey Rhodes, that like has his own backstory that I don't think is as worth getting into. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4451.48s)]
*  But like fans really want him to get the belt. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4455.0s)]
*  Last year, they think he's going to get it at WrestleMania. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4457.16s)]
*  He loses. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4459.24s)]
*  Everybody's livid. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4460.28s)]
*  And WWE is like, just trust us. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4461.639999999999s)]
*  We got this. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4463.8s)]
*  They build it up for another year, almost four years. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4464.599999999999s)]
*  They're building up this fucking. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4466.679999999999s)]
*  Holy shit. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4467.8s)]
*  Some Avengers shit. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4468.92s)]
*  Yeah, just and then I'm sure it's building other things are happening, [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4469.8s)]
*  but like adding more pieces, developing the nuance. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4472.92s)]
*  The Rock comes back and he is initially going to fight this guy, [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4475.56s)]
*  Roman Reigns, for the title because he's the biggest. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4479.72s)]
*  That's the biggest views. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4482.4400000000005s)]
*  But then the fans are so upset. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4484.360000000001s)]
*  The Rock is like, you know what? [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4485.72s)]
*  Fuck it. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4487.0s)]
*  Let these two guys fight. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4487.96s)]
*  Corey Rhodes, I think is his name, Cody and Cody and Roman Reigns. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4489.160000000001s)]
*  And I'm going to turn heel, which is crazy. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4492.6s)]
*  My brother put this in perspective. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4495.080000000001s)]
*  Think about being a borderline billionaire movie star and be like, nah, I'm going to be hated. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4496.280000000001s)]
*  Like the girl, like apparently there's this little girl crying on video. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4503.080000000001s)]
*  Like I can't believe the Rock is a bad person. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4505.96s)]
*  Why is he doing this? [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4508.360000000001s)]
*  Because they don't know. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4509.160000000001s)]
*  I don't talk about meek like that. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4509.88s)]
*  Get up, Rock. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4514.68s)]
*  Meek, you're making it so hard, bro. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4515.320000000001s)]
*  I know. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4517.8s)]
*  That was hard for us. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4518.280000000001s)]
*  We were all meek in that moment, bro. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4519.8s)]
*  You want him to get up. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4521.240000000001s)]
*  I watched the. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4522.280000000001s)]

*  Come on, Rock. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4525.96s)]
*  Get up. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4526.92s)]
*  So Mark, there's a seven minute clip. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4527.72s)]
*  I watched five minutes. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4529.320000000001s)]
*  I saw a five minute clip of like they bring out John Cena. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4530.2s)]
*  They bring out the Rock. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4533.72s)]
*  The Undertaker makes an appearance and the way they fucking deliver with every one of [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4534.92s)]
*  these massive cameos. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4538.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's like perfect. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4540.04s)]
*  You're watching it. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4542.04s)]
*  I don't even I don't know any of this wrestling shit. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4542.92s)]
*  I'm watching this when the Undertaker comes on. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4545.4s)]
*  I'm like, I'm so hype. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4547.32s)]
*  Do you want to see the highlights? [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4549.16s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know what we can play in the fall, but just to get the vibe. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4550.44s)]
*  So they bring out like every hall of fame potential goat wrestler. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4553.16s)]
*  They bring them back if they can for this. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4556.84s)]
*  And then they have this guy Cody Rhodes win and again gears in the making. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4559.56s)]
*  Well, and then this guy Roman Reigns. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4563.160000000001s)]
*  They love him so much as the girl is announcing the new champion like Romans losing the title. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4566.04s)]
*  And they kind of think this is the beginning of him retiring. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4570.76s)]
*  She's literally crying as she's making the announcement like everybody so invested in [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4572.84s)]
*  the story with they all acknowledge. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4577.64s)]
*  It's fake. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4579.080000000001s)]
*  Basically, everybody's aware it's fake and it's just like character development. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4579.96s)]
*  Storytelling it's fucking unbelievable. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4585.64s)]
*  Respect for wrestling skyrocketed after just watching these five minutes. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4588.12s)]
*  And my brother filling me in like Roman Reigns is a superstar because he was like, [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4591.400000000001s)]
*  hey, here's how I'm going to develop a character that is going to have nuance to it. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4595.64s)]
*  Apparently he's like very different than just like the over the top heels that we grew up watching. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4600.04s)]
*  It's like a lot of like manipulate manipulates people and it's like almost like watching. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4604.4400000000005s)]
*  It's almost like cinematic. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4607.64s)]
*  And then there are obviously freak athletes. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4609.320000000001s)]
*  And then he also said Logan Paul was like amazing as a wrestler and fans want to hate him. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4611.72s)]
*  But even the people are like, yeah, he still sucks as a person, but he's fucking good at this. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4617.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4621.8s)]
*  Speed came out that he got. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4622.36s)]
*  They just like went so fucking hard for this. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4625.24s)]
*  Where was it? [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4627.24s)]
*  Philly over two nights to now it's over two nights and we were kids. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4628.44s)]
*  It's one night. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4631.639999999999s)]
*  So over two nights. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4632.36s)]
*  So they don't just build for years with story. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4633.639999999999s)]
*  They build to the second night. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4635.8s)]
*  They have one night. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4637.5599999999995s)]
*  Shit is going to happen, of course, but that's just building more. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4638.76s)]
*  If you're a real wrestling fan, you're going to both. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4641.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, there's no way. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4643.5599999999995s)]
*  Deliver like to build the hype and then deliver is one of the hardest things. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4645.240000000001s)]
*  And they just apparently nailed it. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4649.400000000001s)]
*  And they've transitioned pretty quickly to into not having Vince McMahon involved at all. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4651.88s)]
*  Well, apparently the Triple H took over. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4657.56s)]
*  You remember 100. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4659.56s)]
*  Apparently he took it to new heights. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4660.280000000001s)]
*  Him and Roman Reigns together like really took it to and by every metric. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4661.96s)]
*  Really? [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4665.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, yeah, we don't just necessarily watch as much because there's so many, but like [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4666.04s)]
*  online impressions. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4669.08s)]
*  I think pay per views for this for the highest ever. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4670.360000000001s)]
*  Like by every metric, it's never been more popular. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4672.44s)]
*  Wow. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4675.08s)]
*  Free. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4675.32s)]
*  Did you watch it growing up as a kid? [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4675.88s)]
*  I watched it for like two, three years. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4677.32s)]
*  Probably all watch the same time. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4678.92s)]
*  So rock rock. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4680.12s)]
*  The sun, the rock was you would be like, hey, man, what do you want to eat for dinner? [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4681.799999999999s)]
*  And then the guy would start answering. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4686.5199999999995s)]
*  All we did was live as the rock. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4689.32s)]
*  It was an unbelievable time. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4691.08s)]
*  Yeah, it was incredible. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4692.599999999999s)]
*  And then the suck it shit. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4693.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it was fantastic. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4694.679999999999s)]
*  I went to one when I was a kid. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4695.799999999999s)]
*  Really? [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4697.08s)]
*  How was it really young? [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4697.4s)]
*  And it was out in New Jersey. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4698.759999999999s)]
*  It was cool. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4700.92s)]
*  I got to see the ultimate warrior. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4701.4s)]
*  I think it was ultimate warrior and then undertaker. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4705.32s)]
*  I think they fought or something like that. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4708.2s)]
*  But yeah, it was like it was really cool. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4710.36s)]
*  I mean, completely sold out. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4711.719999999999s)]
*  It's massive arena. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4713.16s)]
*  You just watch some wrestling and this was back in the day. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4714.36s)]
*  I'm sure it's the same now, but where we're like the first few matches, [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4716.44s)]
*  you don't really know the guys and they're just doing, you know, interesting stuff, [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4720.12s)]
*  physical stuff, but the storylines aren't that like pervasive. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4723.24s)]
*  But the headline matches were always really interesting and like that music hits and just. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4726.759999999999s)]
*  Different that goes crazy. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4730.92s)]
*  Yeah, it just goes crazy. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4732.6s)]
*  They've really got this. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4733.72s)]
*  What do you mean that they say that it's fake now? [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4734.6s)]
*  So apparently my brother told me like when they were saying there were sports, [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4738.04s)]
*  there's like all these regulations you got to go through. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4742.12s)]
*  You got to go through commissions. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4744.28s)]
*  You got to there's taxes you got to pay. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4745.400000000001s)]
*  And Vince publicly was like, you know what? [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4747.16s)]
*  It's fake. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4749.16s)]
*  This is entertainment. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4749.72s)]
*  And then you don't have to go through nearly as many hurdles. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4750.92s)]
*  We like it more knowing that it's fake. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4753.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4755.16s)]
*  And I think it's I think he was like, everybody knows anyway. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4755.32s)]
*  Now, my brother said he went to one of these things and he was sitting up top and he was [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4758.28s)]
*  like kind of shocked how many people still believe it's real. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4761.88s)]
*  But online and the online community of wrestling is going to be huge. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4763.96s)]
*  Believing it's believing it's real is like believing Avengers. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4768.5199999999995s)]
*  No, actually, I would I would say believing reality TV is is more plausible. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4773.24s)]
*  Believing it's real is like believing Avengers and that like we know that this is a movie, [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4778.12s)]
*  but we are submitting ourselves to the movie. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4782.76s)]
*  So when someone we care about dies, we get emotional. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4785.24s)]
*  When something really awesome happens, we get excited. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4787.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4789.96s)]
*  And we know it's all fake. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4790.360000000001s)]
*  We know it's all orchestrated. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4791.56s)]
*  But it doesn't matter. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4792.76s)]
*  We are submitting ourselves to the story. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4793.72s)]
*  And that's the power of story to what you were saying is they've really seems like [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4795.400000000001s)]
*  they've really gotten into the story of these characters. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4799.320000000001s)]
*  And now I'm just believing the characters and the wrestling is an excuse to tell the story. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4802.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4807.400000000001s)]
*  Whereas when non-gay soap opera, if you're a guy, you don't feel embarrassed about watching the soap opera. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4808.04s)]
*  And then when we were down in Mexico, we were watching that Lucha Libre. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4813.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4816.92s)]
*  To me, and again, there might be stories that are built in for generations. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4817.48s)]
*  And yeah, I don't know. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4821.24s)]
*  But for me, it seemed like it was much more about the acrobatics. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4822.2s)]
*  Yeah, the sport. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4826.12s)]
*  Yes. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4827.08s)]
*  Where it was just like the choreography was insane. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4827.96s)]
*  There's three people and there's like three and three matches the whole time. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4830.92s)]
*  And it was really awesome what they were doing. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4835.16s)]
*  But I don't even know if they talked. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4837.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4839.48s)]
*  I don't remember if they were talking at all. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4840.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4842.92s)]
*  But it was really awesome. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4843.16s)]
*  The choreography was awesome, but a little bit different than this. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4844.76s)]
*  Where it's like all that cheering and insane explosions of the reactions came from one chokeslam. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4847.0s)]
*  It's just tension. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4856.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's so cool. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4858.92s)]
*  Okay, what else we got, my boys? [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4860.2s)]
*  I wonder how much Rock gets for coming back. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4861.24s)]
*  Apparently, I think he's involved. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4863.88s)]
*  He's like a board member or something. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4865.32s)]
*  He's like up there with the company that acquired WW. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4867.16s)]
*  TKO or something they're called. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4869.8s)]
*  I could be wrong about that. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4871.32s)]
*  And then it was kind of cool to just be like, you know what? [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4873.8s)]
*  I'm getting pushback on being the main event even though I'm going to get the most. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4877.0s)]
*  So let's just have some fun. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4880.44s)]
*  I'm going to turn heel. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4881.88s)]
*  And apparently he's really good as a heel. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4882.92s)]
*  Wrestling fans who are into story are like, he's fucking great as this and better than he is as Dwayne Johnson. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4884.52s)]
*  He's great at this. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4891.16s)]
*  Apparently cussing to the point that they're having to edit him a bunch and it's just like, what's going on here? [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4892.28s)]
*  But he's just in it. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4896.92s)]
*  And they love that. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4898.12s)]
*  Well, he also played a villain. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4899.24s)]
*  He played Black Adam as the first villain he did. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4900.6s)]
*  So it might be like a... [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4904.28s)]
*  He started as a heel. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4905.72s)]
*  He started heel. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4906.6s)]
*  He started heel, but he was so funny that people just loved him. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4908.280000000001s)]
*  They had to build in the storyline that he was... [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4911.72s)]
*  Because I remember he was supposed to be a heel, but he gets such a big pop that I was like 14. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4914.04s)]
*  I'm watching. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4918.76s)]
*  I'm like, they can't keep... [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4919.400000000001s)]
*  I remember being like, they can't keep him as a bad guy, right? [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4920.76s)]
*  We love him. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4923.72s)]
*  He's so funny. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4924.68s)]
*  That's the power of funny. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4925.72s)]
*  He just won off of humor. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4927.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's awesome. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4929.72s)]
*  I want to see Stone Cold. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4930.52s)]
*  What else we got, boys? [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4932.6s)]
*  I mean, we can talk about the squatter thing. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4934.4400000000005s)]
*  What's up with the squatter? [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4936.76s)]
*  The squatter thing is interesting, dude. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4937.48s)]
*  The squatter thing is very interesting. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4939.16s)]
*  Have you heard about this? [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4940.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4941.5599999999995s)]
*  No, I've had to deal with it. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4942.2s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4943.639999999999s)]
*  So it just is a huge thing. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4944.2s)]
*  I was even looking it up to see what is going on. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4946.2s)]
*  It's just super popular, especially as of last month. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4949.08s)]
*  It's being covered everywhere. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4951.72s)]
*  And the headlines are crazy. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4953.32s)]
*  There's a bunch of headlines where it's like, [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4955.0s)]
*  Man Prevents Family From Retiring In Dream Home With Down Syndrome Son. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4958.04s)]
*  Squatter Prevents A Family From Retiring In Their Dream Home. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4961.88s)]
*  Man Wins A Dead Woman's Home. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4964.92s)]
*  And there's just insane stories of this [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4968.04s)]
*  Beverly Hills mansion across the street from LeBron James [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4971.24s)]
*  that's overrun with squatters that are using it to party. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4974.2s)]
*  It's a $4 million property. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4978.28s)]
*  Wow. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4980.92s)]
*  So just so we can explain and set the tone of this conversation, [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4981.24s)]
*  everybody should know what squatting is if you don't. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4988.2s)]
*  There are, I guess, some sort of protections for... [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4990.28s)]
*  This shit goes deep. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4993.96s)]
*  I did not realize how complicated and nuanced this is. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4995.08s)]
*  So a squatter is somebody that goes and lives in a home that's not theirs. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=4997.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's how it's understood. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5001.64s)]
*  That's how it's understood. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5002.68s)]
*  Now, it appears that there are some protections for people that do this. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5003.72s)]
*  Yes. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5007.32s)]
*  Okay, break it down. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5007.88s)]
*  So there's a bunch of things. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5008.76s)]
*  So this one is just funny. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5009.56s)]
*  I just bring this up because it's the most crazy example. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5010.68s)]
*  This is literally in the middle of Beverly Hills. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5012.76s)]
*  If you look at the map of people around him, [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5014.6s)]
*  it's like LeBron James, like John Legend is right there. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5016.44s)]
*  And the guy's hilarious. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5019.0s)]
*  He's like this Italian dude. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5020.04s)]
*  One all-night bash drew 645 rabblers and didn't end until 9 a.m. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5021.32s)]
*  Was this turned into a nightclub, essentially? [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5026.92s)]
*  Better than that. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5030.28s)]
*  I mean, it was classier than that, I would say. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5032.84s)]
*  But this was basically a party house, no? [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5035.4s)]
*  At some point, yeah. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5039.639999999999s)]
*  Here's what happened. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5040.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, it's so funny. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5041.4s)]
*  This is a nightclub. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5043.24s)]
*  He's like, it's not a nightclub. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5044.04s)]
*  I'm not a fucking animal. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5045.32s)]
*  And then they ask the guy, they're like, [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5046.759999999999s)]
*  so are you going to stay here for a while? [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5047.88s)]
*  He's like, no, I might move on to something nicer. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5048.84s)]
*  Maybe get a different mansion or something like that. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5050.84s)]
*  This dude's hilarious. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5052.52s)]
*  But there's just a bunch of these happening all over the country [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5053.72s)]
*  that people are talking about. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5055.56s)]
*  So how does it happen? [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5056.4400000000005s)]
*  It goes all the way back to the medieval ages, [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5057.72s)]
*  medieval times, feudal times. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5059.88s)]
*  Yeah, literally. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5061.24s)]
*  I didn't realize this shit went so far back. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5062.52s)]
*  It goes back even farther than that. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5064.360000000001s)]
*  There's rules in Roman law about how to deal with land disputes. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5065.96s)]
*  So basically, it's this thing called adverse possession. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5070.68s)]
*  So hypothetically, we're two nobles back in medieval England. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5074.360000000001s)]
*  We have a bunch of land that's near each other. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5077.96s)]
*  And we're talking like hundreds of acres [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5080.28s)]
*  that's just sort of given to you from you inherited it, whatever. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5081.719999999999s)]
*  In between your land, there's some land that no one's using. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5085.4s)]
*  It's just not being, you can't go all the way over there. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5088.44s)]
*  It's hundreds of acres away. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5090.84s)]
*  It's like no one's looking at it, no one's seeing it. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5092.36s)]
*  So what they kind of had was common grounds. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5094.679999999999s)]
*  Where if some dude just kind of came by and set up a house there, [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5097.08s)]
*  he could just kind of use the land. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5101.4s)]
*  And if you never said anything about it, [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5103.32s)]
*  over a certain period of time, it would just become his. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5105.0s)]
*  And kind of the reason this would happen is like, [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5108.28s)]
*  you basically have a guy that lives there. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5111.4s)]
*  He builds up a house, he has a bunch of kids, his kids have kids. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5113.96s)]
*  Also now he's a community of like 100 people in a tiny little village, [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5116.36s)]
*  hundreds of miles away from anyone. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5119.48s)]
*  It prevents the nobles, like great-grandson from pulling up and like, [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5121.5599999999995s)]
*  hey, this is actually mine. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5124.679999999999s)]
*  It basically gives them the right to say, [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5127.08s)]
*  hey, we've been here for 50 years. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5128.679999999999s)]
*  I don't know anything about you. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5130.5199999999995s)]
*  My great-great-grandfather was on this land. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5132.12s)]
*  This land is ours. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5134.44s)]
*  And it gives them the protection to say like, [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5135.88s)]
*  if you're here and no one says shit about it for a certain period of time, [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5137.719999999999s)]
*  you can have it. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5140.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5142.2s)]
*  And it sounds ridiculous, but think about it. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5142.5199999999995s)]
*  There is a time where literally all the land was owned by how many nobles are there. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5144.76s)]
*  You have the kingdom and then you have the nobles. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5152.36s)]
*  So let's just call it 50 people. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5154.36s)]
*  Maybe it's less. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5156.04s)]
*  And they just parceled up all the land. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5157.16s)]
*  They're not even using it. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5159.88s)]
*  They're not even looking at it. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5160.84s)]
*  So it does kind of make sense. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5162.36s)]
*  In a way to create some democratization of the land [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5165.24s)]
*  that you let other people have the right to squat. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5170.12s)]
*  And it basically gives like an incentive to use it or lose it basically. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5172.599999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5175.88s)]
*  So like use the land, make something out of it. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5176.2s)]
*  And if you're not really doing anything about it and you don't say anything, [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5178.2s)]
*  then someone else that's using it, the government will be like, [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5180.84s)]
*  yeah, we like this community. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5183.08s)]
*  So was this like written into law by the kingdom? [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5184.04s)]
*  Why would the kingdom? [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5186.36s)]
*  Because the kingdom was like, I could just fucking take all this land. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5187.16s)]
*  It was basically understood as British common law. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5189.24s)]
*  And like the British royal at the time, I think it was like Henry I or some shit, [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5191.64s)]
*  was basically like, we're going to permit this because these peasants need someplace to go. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5196.04s)]
*  OK. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5199.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5199.96s)]
*  But if they did want to take your land, they still would. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5200.28s)]
*  I think probably. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5202.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5203.24s)]
*  But I like this idea, to a certain extent, use it or lose it. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5203.72s)]
*  Let's say you have hundreds and hundreds of thousands and thousands of acres. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5207.96s)]
*  We're talking about huge swaths of land. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5210.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5212.36s)]
*  You're not seeing other people. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5213.16s)]
*  It's an entire state. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5214.28s)]
*  You're not even seeing somebody. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5215.48s)]
*  You never even know that they're on your land. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5217.24s)]
*  Do you just get to keep that because you guys declared it years ago? [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5220.6s)]
*  You just happen to be a noble person. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5224.6s)]
*  And you're a great, great grandfather. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5226.4400000000005s)]
*  You've been here five generations. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5227.8s)]
*  And so then it kind of like extends even like to modern America, where it's like, [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5229.160000000001s)]
*  let's say you have two ranchers, right? [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5231.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5233.240000000001s)]
*  And they have two ranches. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5233.64s)]
*  Again, we're talking hundreds, thousands of acres right next to each other. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5235.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5237.320000000001s)]
*  And you build a fence and it kind of is hard to like demarcate exactly where one land starts [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5237.4800000000005s)]
*  and one land ends. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5242.12s)]
*  Let's say it's over like 100 feet and it stays like that for 50 years. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5242.84s)]
*  And all of a sudden you look at the title and you're like, wait a second. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5247.240000000001s)]
*  Our land is 50 feet over that way. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5249.4s)]
*  That's like 30 acres. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5251.16s)]
*  That's ours. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5252.759999999999s)]
*  You can't then go and be like, hey, give it to us. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5253.719999999999s)]
*  Because basically you've said like this fence is here. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5256.44s)]
*  Enough time has passed. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5258.759999999999s)]
*  You haven't said anything about it. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5259.639999999999s)]
*  So tough shit. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5260.759999999999s)]
*  This is how Brooklyn and Queens got separated. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5262.04s)]
*  There's no reason why they should be separated. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5264.679999999999s)]
*  It's literally one island. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5266.28s)]
*  It's just a dumb line that goes like crazy down certain streets in Brooklyn and Queens. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5267.639999999999s)]
*  But it was the Dutch and the English couldn't settle. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5272.679999999999s)]
*  There's two people, basically the Dutch of Bushwick and the English of [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5275.48s)]
*  Ridgewood or what a vice versa. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5279.639999999999s)]
*  They had a big argument and they literally could not find the middle ground. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5281.4s)]
*  And then they found a rock called Arbitration Rock because the government was finally like, [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5284.12s)]
*  we got to start putting lines down and keeping these people away from each other. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5287.799999999999s)]
*  And they made a rock the middle point of Brooklyn and Queens. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5292.04s)]
*  Weird. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5295.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5295.719999999999s)]
*  And so for certain people- [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5296.44s)]
*  That rock still there? [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5297.16s)]
*  Yep. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5298.12s)]
*  Oh, fire. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5298.5199999999995s)]
*  Now that is frustrating that ranch shit just because someone put the fucking fence wrong. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5299.24s)]
*  They get to keep the land. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5303.4s)]
*  You got to say something about it. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5304.2s)]
*  You got to be like, wait a second, this fence is actually wrong. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5305.48s)]
*  And if it's within, most places have 20 or 30 year windows. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5307.4s)]
*  But aren't we incentivizing people to put the fence wrong? [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5310.92s)]
*  Yeah, this happens in Florida all the time. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5313.16s)]
*  People will put their fence on that side of someone's property line. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5316.36s)]
*  And if they can hold it for 20 years, they get another two feet. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5319.639999999999s)]
*  I don't love this just because we're incentivizing people to take advantage of their neighbor. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5324.36s)]
*  But you could then just be like, hey, you took my shit and then take it to a civil court. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5328.759999999999s)]
*  And then the court would be like, yeah, they have to move it. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5332.44s)]
*  And then they're fined or something. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5334.04s)]
*  Sure. But now the burden is on me to hire a lawyer to spend money because this person did something. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5334.92s)]
*  And it's a net loss either way. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5340.92s)]
*  Unethical. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5342.28s)]
*  I don't gain two feet on their side if they do it. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5343.16s)]
*  If there was a punishment, like, hey, if you do this and you're wrong, you lose two feet. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5345.4800000000005s)]
*  They have to pay to pull the fence up and shit. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5349.0s)]
*  But basically that's not it. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5351.0s)]
*  The law. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5351.96s)]
*  Sorry Vince. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5352.4400000000005s)]
*  They have to pay to put it there. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5352.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's still no game. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5353.72s)]
*  They should pay to pull the fence up. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5354.52s)]
*  They put it in the wrong place knowing. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5355.96s)]
*  Listen up, noodle dicks. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5357.4s)]
*  You know what that blue light means? [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5358.4400000000005s)]

*  I can't lift my legs up as high as Schultz. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5362.68s)]
*  I have very tight hip flexors. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5365.8s)]
*  Anyway, you know what's not tight? [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5367.56s)]
*  Probably your dick game. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5369.56s)]
*  Probably loose, weak as fuck, weak hips. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5370.68s)]
*  You're not doing anything right. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5372.84s)]

*  All right, guys, we got to talk about something important. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5431.639999999999s)]
*  Sometimes you might get injured because of someone else's negligence, maybe even maliciousness. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5433.639999999999s)]
*  But oftentimes one guy's negligence causes another person to get hurt. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5438.36s)]
*  And what you might not realize is you can get a settlement if you're one of those people getting hurt. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5444.12s)]
*  So if you're in an accident, not calling a lawyer means you could be leaving money on the table. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5447.88s)]
*  And when you are seriously hurt, your injury could be worth millions. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5452.4400000000005s)]
*  So if you're ever injured, you can check out Morgan and Morgan Morgan Morgan. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5455.56s)]
*  We've talked about on this podcast. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5459.16s)]
*  They are America's largest injury law firm. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5460.2s)]
*  They have recovered over 20 billion dollars for over 500,000 clients. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5462.04s)]
*  That's a lot of money for a lot of people. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5466.4400000000005s)]
*  So if you are injured because of someone else's negligence, that sucks. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5468.6s)]
*  You got to go through the medical procedures. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5472.68s)]
*  You got to go through the insurance companies. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5474.12s)]
*  That's all hard. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5476.36s)]

*  Let's get back to the show. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5502.679999999999s)]
*  The law prevents squabbling after a certain period of time. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5503.72s)]
*  So if you didn't say shit for 30 years, it's like we're not going to go back and forth [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5506.76s)]
*  and waste resources to try to figure this out. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5509.8s)]
*  It just is. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5511.72s)]
*  But let's say, for example, again, I'm just trying to... [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5512.280000000001s)]
*  To me, the issue is not the guy who makes the mistake. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5516.280000000001s)]
*  The issue is that now the system has incentivized. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5519.400000000001s)]
*  Let's say we own this big ranch land. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5522.2s)]
*  You and I both were neighbors and you just go, hey, Schultz, I want to set up just like a fence [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5524.360000000001s)]
*  because I have some sheep that I want to keep in. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5528.76s)]
*  I don't want them going onto your land. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5530.360000000001s)]
*  I know that you protect your land. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5531.8s)]

*  I just want to... [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5534.12s)]
*  And I go, oh, that's a great idea, Mark. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5534.76s)]
*  You propose the plan. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5536.92s)]
*  I agree with the proposed plan. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5538.12s)]
*  Then you go put in the fence and then you have this new plan [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5540.12s)]
*  where you're taking another 30 acres from me. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5542.6s)]
*  I'm agreeing to your proposed plan, but I'm not walking in there [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5545.08s)]
*  and checking every single stump. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5547.320000000001s)]
*  Like, I don't know. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5548.68s)]
*  You're so incentivized to fuck me by the law where the law should be punishing people [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5550.28s)]
*  that fuck their neighbors over. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5557.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't know exactly, but I think there are punishment if you lose in civil court. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5560.12s)]
*  You're fine and I think you then have to settle with the person you stole from. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5564.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you should have to give them something. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5567.639999999999s)]
*  It should. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5569.08s)]
*  That's how I understand it. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5569.72s)]
*  If you can prove that someone did it on purpose, this should be viewed as theft. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5570.84s)]
*  Yeah, and I think it is. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5574.2s)]
*  And that's grand larceny. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5575.0s)]
*  That's jail. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5576.68s)]
*  Depending on the amount of land that was stolen. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5577.32s)]
*  It's really fucked up. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5580.44s)]
*  Anyway, go on. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5581.32s)]
*  So there's some periods of time where people actually like squatters. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5581.96s)]
*  Post-World War II in England, all of London is bombed. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5585.0s)]
*  You have all these baby boomers coming home and basically you have like a housing crisis. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5588.679999999999s)]
*  And so these British people are then finding like dilapidated, [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5593.08s)]
*  like derelict homes that got bombed. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5595.799999999999s)]
*  They're kind of just like pulling up, fixing it, turning into like livable communities. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5597.799999999999s)]
*  And people are like, wow, look at the British people. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5601.88s)]
*  They're not homeless. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5603.799999999999s)]
*  They're actually like industrious and making the best of their situation. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5604.5199999999995s)]
*  So for a period they were like praised. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5607.4s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5610.12s)]
*  And then what about the, what are the people that own those homes that were bombed do? [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5610.5199999999995s)]
*  The squatter fucking just died. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5613.96s)]
*  So it's like, no one is looking after this. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5616.28s)]
*  We don't know whose it is. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5618.679999999999s)]
*  There's not like record keeping that's perfect. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5621.0s)]
*  It's all on paper. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5622.92s)]
*  They got burned in some like fire bombing. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5623.639999999999s)]
*  What is it? [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5627.639999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5629.719999999999s)]
*  So I'm not even looking at that as a squatter. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5630.759999999999s)]
*  I only see a squatter as somebody who is living in a home or area or space is owned by someone else. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5633.5599999999995s)]
*  That's what actual squatting is. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5639.24s)]
*  So for it to be considered actual squatting needs five things, sometimes six. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5641.32s)]
*  Needs to be hostile. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5644.6s)]
*  This one's actually interesting. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5645.96s)]
*  You have to take it without some type of contract or some type of understanding that it's owned by someone else. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5647.240000000001s)]
*  So you can't have like a lease then overstay it. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5653.96s)]
*  That's no longer a squatter. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5656.040000000001s)]
*  That's like a holdover tenant. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5657.240000000001s)]
*  So it has to be hostile where you don't have some type of like written agreement. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5658.360000000001s)]
*  Has to be actual. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5662.120000000001s)]
*  You have to be living there and like improving the place and living as if you were the owner paying taxes and shit. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5663.0s)]
*  Open and notorious. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5667.88s)]
*  You can't be hiding or like being protective. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5668.84s)]
*  You have to just be like walking around doing shit like how you normally would. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5671.0s)]
*  Continuous. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5674.2s)]
*  It has to be like full length of the time. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5674.84s)]
*  You can't just show up like once a year. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5676.4400000000005s)]
*  And then in some places it has to be in good faith. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5678.2s)]
*  Meaning that you have to have some type of reasonable reason that you could present in front of a judge that you would get this land or you would get this home. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5681.0s)]
*  So those are like the five things. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5687.88s)]
*  Like Louisiana has an interesting one where it's like you just need to basically have it for 30 years uninterrupted and you can keep it. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5689.56s)]
*  Like theirs is like even more loose. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5697.0s)]
*  And it exists because it gives ownership. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5699.0s)]
*  It basically like there's a bunch of reasons. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5701.64s)]
*  It gives a statute of limitations to like land squabbling back in the day. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5703.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5707.96s)]
*  It makes people kind of like cure minor defects within like a lease. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5708.84s)]
*  Let's say like you sell me a piece of land and you're like yeah it's everything including the lake or including the pond. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5713.24s)]
*  And then in the title it gets fucked up and it doesn't include the pond but I keep the land. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5717.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5721.64s)]
*  And if no one says anything about the pond then the pond is mine after 30 years just because it was originally in the verbal contract there but not in the title. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5722.28s)]
*  Got it. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5729.4s)]
*  So like settles up like that minor little thing. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5729.96s)]
*  And then also like it gives that productivity of land that use it or lose it. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5732.28s)]
*  So what's happening now is nothing to do with squatting. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5736.92s)]
*  Got it. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5739.88s)]
*  So all of these stories that people are looking at are called squatter's rights but it's not squatter's rights. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5740.44s)]
*  They're basically taking advantage of a system that people did find advantageous for potentially everybody. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5743.88s)]
*  And now they're just using it in their favor legally. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5750.92s)]
*  Kind of. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5755.88s)]
*  Like it's barely even that because it's like it's basically just like tenant rights. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5756.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5760.44s)]
*  And so which basically is nothing to do. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5761.419999999999s)]
*  So whenever people call squatter's rights it's sort of a misnomer. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5762.78s)]
*  Ah right because squatting seems so much more salacious. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5765.099999999999s)]
*  Just a random stranger breaks into your home and just lives there. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5769.0199999999995s)]
*  It's a term that makes so much sense. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5771.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5772.86s)]
*  We call them squatters. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5772.94s)]
*  Yeah it paints a picture in your head. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5774.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah so it makes sense but under the law like I don't think there's any like clear legal definition. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5775.82s)]
*  Okay so all these stories are. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5779.66s)]
*  They're interesting. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5782.219999999999s)]
*  So it's like the story that people are talking about is like okay you go on vacation for three weeks and then someone pulls up in your house and then they can just live there and you can live there. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5783.179999999999s)]
*  You can't get them out and then the government fucks you. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5790.86s)]
*  That's like what the story is. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5793.099999999999s)]
*  Some of the stories are even like some woman went out for groceries and then came back and someone was living in her house and then she couldn't get them out. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5794.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah these don't sound real. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5799.58s)]
*  Yeah the first that one is not real. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5800.86s)]
*  Like you can basically call the police be like hey there's a breaking and entering. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5802.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5804.78s)]
*  The police show up and they're like hey are you the tenant that lives here and the guy is like yes I am. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5805.0199999999995s)]
*  And they're like oh can you just show me your ID show me a piece of mail show me a lease show me anything. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5808.54s)]
*  And if they don't have that they'll get arrested immediately. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5812.299999999999s)]
*  It's just breaking and entering. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5814.139999999999s)]
*  So like the law protects that. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5815.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5816.299999999999s)]
*  And so basically in New York you have a thing where if you live in a place for over 30 days then that's when they get tenant rights. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5816.86s)]
*  Even if you are living there illegally. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5823.98s)]
*  Yes. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5826.94s)]
*  Like let's say for example I went on vacation somebody moved into my home I come back after 30 days. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5827.34s)]
*  I mean that's crazy short. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5833.9s)]
*  They get tenant rights. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5835.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5836.139999999999s)]
*  They get tenant rights. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5836.46s)]
*  And then what is the justification for that. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5837.9s)]
*  I'm assuming it basically protects people from having like oral agreements. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5840.139999999999s)]
*  So you go on vacation you're like yeah Mark you can stay in my place. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5843.74s)]
*  Drunk off my shower whatever you want to do. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5845.9s)]
*  And then you leave. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5847.5s)]
*  You can't just come back and be like this guy's blah blah blah he's in my place. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5849.34s)]
*  And it's like dude you told me I could stay here for six months. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5852.94s)]
*  No write up a contract. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5854.78s)]
*  Like that's an easy solution. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5855.9s)]
*  But then you tear up the contract. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5858.46s)]
*  This is back in the day when it's like a piece of paper you can just tear it up. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5859.5s)]
*  You lose the contract. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5861.98s)]
*  So this is a law that needs to be changed basically. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5862.46s)]
*  Yeah a lot of people are suggesting. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5864.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5865.66s)]
*  The 30 day tenancy law and then tenant rights would be like you can't turn off the electricity you can't turn off the water you can't change the locks. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5866.38s)]
*  Back in the day. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5872.299999999999s)]
*  That's the shit that sucks. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5873.099999999999s)]
*  So it's like if you're a landlord you still have to if even if this person is squatting or just staying there unlawfully you still have to keep the electricity on. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5874.94s)]
*  You still have to maintain the place. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5884.62s)]
*  If you stop doing any of those things now you're in violation of their rights and they they can one stay there longer and make a case for not having to pay because. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5885.9s)]
*  And is the justification for this innocent until proven guilty. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5895.98s)]
*  In other words if somebody is there for a certain amount of time the state assumes that they have a legal reason to be there. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5899.74s)]
*  And until that is disputed in court. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5905.82s)]
*  Yes. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5908.139999999999s)]
*  God. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5908.86s)]
*  And okay okay okay. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5909.26s)]
*  Whereas if you're the landlord you know if somebody is living there illegally. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5910.46s)]
*  But but based on our justice system they cannot assume that this person is breaking the law. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5914.139999999999s)]
*  And the cops pull up. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5919.66s)]
*  Yes. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5920.86s)]
*  The cops pull up and then you have mail that's in your name with the address and you maybe have like a fake lease or something. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5921.179999999999s)]
*  And the police are like we can't take this person out we can't evict them. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5927.660000000001s)]
*  So now this is a civil matter that has to be taken care of. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5931.660000000001s)]
*  And then until it's going to take care of in court you get to stay there and live there. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5933.820000000001s)]
*  Got it. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5939.5s)]
*  Okay now now it's now I understand how it's taking advantage of our justice system which with the assumption of innocence. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5939.900000000001s)]
*  I understand why those rights exist. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5949.02s)]
*  And there used to be no tenant laws and tenants used to get fucked all the time. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5951.5s)]
*  Yes. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5954.54s)]
*  Some guy would be like oh I don't like you because. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5954.86s)]
*  Get the fuck out. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5957.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah oh you're dating a black girl. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5957.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5959.42s)]
*  Like I'm a racist dude fuck you I'm turning your electricity off get the fuck out of my place. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5959.98s)]
*  Hey your kids are too loud they're screaming they're waking people up. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5963.5s)]
*  Turn the water out. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5966.219999999999s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5967.339999999999s)]
*  Right so these laws in New York I imagine around the country they had to be created to protect people that were being put under abusive conditions by their landlords. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5968.38s)]
*  Like unions. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5978.38s)]
*  Right. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5979.42s)]
*  Necessary. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5979.82s)]
*  There were potentially abusive conditions and you want to protect these people. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5980.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5984.219999999999s)]
*  That kind of makes sense. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5985.179999999999s)]
*  In some cases people even get scammed. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5985.9s)]
*  So like what this guy with the mansion is kind of alleging is like you go out of town for two months let's say you leave for six months you're going to your fucking other house whatever right. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5988.139999999999s)]
*  Someone comes in they change all the locks they get mail delivered they're now squatting and then they find someone to say hey I'm gonna give you a lease for the place. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=5996.299999999999s)]
*  I'm the owner do you want a great deal on a on a apartment. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6004.38s)]
*  Oh fuck. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6007.74s)]
*  And so now a family let's say a couple or a single mom or kid are now getting put into an apartment. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6008.54s)]
*  I the guy who originally who originally is lauded. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6014.62s)]
*  But because they have tenants rights now. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6017.58s)]
*  So now you come back and you're like why the fuck you my house. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6019.98s)]
*  They're like it's not your house. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6022.379999999999s)]
*  Paying money. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6024.299999999999s)]
*  Steve's house and he gave me the lease. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6024.86s)]
*  And you're like no it's my house and then it's like what are we doing I've been living here for four months while you were gone. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6026.62s)]
*  And I have to assume that you're innocent so we will bring this to the courts and the courts will decide. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6031.419999999999s)]
*  That person kind of is innocent because they didn't know they were breaking the law. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6036.54s)]
*  Yeah I just didn't realize how important the presumption of innocence is in these cases. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6039.5s)]
*  Because we're all looking at these people like they are bad people. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6043.18s)]
*  You're living in a place that is not yours. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6045.5s)]
*  You're fucking over this landlord. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6047.18s)]
*  And some people do do that. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6048.3s)]
*  Yeah of course. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6049.26s)]
*  I imagine the majority of the most salacious stories that we hear about are in the example of this. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6050.54s)]
*  The stories that you hear on the news like this guy has just broken into this home he's not paying any money refuses to leave. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6056.62s)]
*  This is this person's retirement and now he's forced to go back and get a job at Walmart because he can't pay his bills. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6061.74s)]
*  Because he's got to squatter. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6067.9s)]
*  That's that story. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6068.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6069.66s)]
*  But there are these stories where people are taking advantage of and they have these tense rights. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6069.98s)]
*  Okay this is good this is good this is good keep going. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6074.3s)]
*  So then how do you evict someone after they take over your place? [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6076.139999999999s)]
*  There's a bunch of ways it happens. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6078.62s)]
*  Like COVID kind of exacerbated the issue because then there were all these moratoriums on eviction. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6079.9s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6083.74s)]
*  Airbnb caused a lot of problems because someone will get an Airbnb get it for three days pay the 500 bucks and not leave. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6083.98s)]
*  Yeah I heard about that. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6090.7s)]
*  Yeah yeah you got that that happened Alex. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6091.82s)]
*  And that happens all the time. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6093.98s)]
*  Now in order for that person to not be evicted they have to be there for more than 30 days. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6095.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6102.46s)]
*  And in your circumstance they were there for more than 30. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6103.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6105.58s)]
*  And then how long did they manage? [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6105.9800000000005s)]
*  I made the mistake they did Airbnb for a week. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6107.26s)]
*  And then? [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6110.9400000000005s)]
*  And then they were like yo I'll hit you direct and you'll make more money. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6111.5s)]
*  And then so after we did that he just paid me for a week and then he's like I'm not paying anymore. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6116.700000000001s)]
*  And I was like all right get out. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6121.9800000000005s)]
*  He's like no I'm not going anywhere. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6122.9400000000005s)]
*  Was he there for more than 30 days? [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6124.46s)]
*  He was there for six months. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6125.82s)]
*  No no I mean before he told you he's not leaving. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6127.58s)]
*  Yeah by that time by the yeah I think it hit a month by that. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6131.1s)]
*  So he knew what he was doing. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6134.38s)]
*  Yeah he knew the game. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6135.34s)]
*  He was playing the game. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6135.9s)]
*  He has to get to a month once he's there for a month and he's getting mail he has all these things done. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6136.7s)]
*  And like he started off super nice super like oh I was like oh great tenant. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6140.54s)]
*  I didn't think that he would try to fuck me over because he was like super nice. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6144.86s)]
*  And the house was fucked when he left right? [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6148.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6149.9s)]
*  Left. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6151.34s)]
*  Yeah everything was trash fucking cigarette butts everywhere like it was disgusting. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6152.3s)]
*  Wow. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6156.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6157.1s)]
*  Fuck me over for six months. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6157.66s)]
*  Wow. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6159.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah it's a it's a bitch. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6159.42s)]
*  So like in order to evict someone in New York you have to file formal eviction notice. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6161.34s)]
*  10 day notice on the door basically say like hey get the fuck out. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6165.5s)]
*  If they ignore that then there's a petition for special proceedings. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6168.3s)]
*  They have to go to a court. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6171.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6172.3s)]
*  Look at how getting PTSD is you're bringing all this up. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6172.46s)]
*  Bro. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6174.3s)]
*  It was so bad. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6175.0199999999995s)]
*  The squatter has to appear in court. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6175.74s)]
*  They either appear and then the judge almost always rules not in favor of the squatter. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6177.900000000001s)]
*  Like it's very rare for a squatter to get it because like we said you have to have all of [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6181.66s)]
*  these other things to yeah classifies a squatter. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6184.780000000001s)]
*  I'm not sure they're getting the emails on. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6187.66s)]
*  A lot of times they will make up a reason why they need to postpone the date so they just [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6190.9400000000005s)]
*  push it further. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6196.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6197.66s)]
*  Filibuster. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6198.780000000001s)]
*  Now you got to take off of work you got to stop your life to make sure you show up because if [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6199.34s)]
*  you don't show up. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6202.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6203.66s)]
*  Usually it's costing you money and you're paying for utilities and you're paying for gas. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6204.379999999999s)]
*  And this is so interesting. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6208.219999999999s)]
*  And they're fucking up your whole house. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6209.82s)]
*  Yep. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6211.179999999999s)]
*  And they're almost incentivized to fuck up the house because if they fuck it up you might [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6211.9s)]
*  be like yo it's not worth it. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6215.099999999999s)]
*  It's not worth it to what? [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6216.94s)]
*  To keep fighting. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6218.0599999999995s)]
*  Take this back like you fucked it up so bad. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6218.7s)]
*  I'm going to take it back I'm going to pay fifty thousand dollars in repairs. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6220.86s)]
*  So there are some people that actually give up the home. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6224.78s)]
*  I guess. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6227.419999999999s)]
*  It's just not worth it. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6228.0599999999995s)]
*  You would still have to pay back the mortgage right because that's a loan from the bank. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6228.86s)]
*  Who knows maybe you inherit the house it's worth like fifty thousand you have a ton of [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6232.14s)]
*  money it's like some shitty shack the guy's a drug addict he keeps it trashes it and you're [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6235.9800000000005s)]
*  like I'm going to have to pour a hundred to even get this. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6239.34s)]
*  It's not even worth it. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6241.74s)]
*  Working. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6242.38s)]
*  Oh yeah yeah. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6242.78s)]
*  This is a time where you understand why Texas is so pro-gun. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6244.38s)]
*  And they got like Castle Doctrine and shit you can just like pull up be like yo get the fuck out. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6248.78s)]
*  Get the fuck out. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6252.46s)]
*  It's really interesting though so these people are taking advantage of a policy that was made [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6253.5s)]
*  to protect tenants from abusive landlords. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6259.5s)]
*  So we like the policy because there were abusive landlords that just kick people out for no reason. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6262.86s)]
*  Policies are good now the landlords got to behave now you got to treat those people in there well [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6267.42s)]
*  and you should have a good relationship between you and the landlord because you both have a [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6271.66s)]
*  little bit of power in this circumstance. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6275.42s)]
*  Landlords a piece of shit you could withhold pay and now this landlord's fucked and he doesn't [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6277.099999999999s)]
*  want that and now you're sitting there for six months before you can even get somebody out of [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6281.5s)]
*  the home and now he's six months out of rent. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6284.54s)]
*  Think about that that's horrible. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6287.0199999999995s)]
*  Okay let's be nice to each other and let's make sure that we really pick tenants that we're going [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6289.099999999999s)]
*  to respect and care for and everything's going to be good symbiotic relationship. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6293.0199999999995s)]
*  These people come in they go oh there's really favorable tenant rules and I just need to trick [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6296.139999999999s)]
*  them into letting me be here for a month. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6299.9s)]
*  Got it. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6302.139999999999s)]
*  Most people don't even know this. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6302.54s)]
*  Got it. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6304.62s)]
*  And they stay there for six months and then they bounced to another spot stay there for six months. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6304.94s)]
*  Stay there for six months. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6307.98s)]
*  These people are like typically criminals drug addicts mentally ill something. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6309.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah that's interesting. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6312.78s)]
*  They'll get a roommate and live with a roommate and then change the locks on the roommate be like [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6314.22s)]
*  I got your place. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6318.06s)]
*  No way. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6319.18s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6320.860000000001s)]
*  So this happens all the time so it's like you kind of got to try to fix the tenant [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6321.820000000001s)]
*  like rights thing without fucking over tenants. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6325.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6328.06s)]
*  And creates like how do you quickly find out if someone is fraudulently living there. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6328.620000000001s)]
*  It's really expediting that process. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6332.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6334.06s)]
*  And the problem is when you live in a city with eight million people I imagine those [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6334.620000000001s)]
*  court systems are completely backed up there's a million different cases they're bringing they [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6338.14s)]
*  have nothing to do with this right. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6341.5s)]
*  Oh my lord. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6343.580000000001s)]
*  So they're also taking advantage of how backed up our system is. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6344.780000000001s)]
*  It's not very efficient. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6348.06s)]
*  And how do we prove that somebody should legally live there or not. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6349.9800000000005s)]
*  You can't trust the landlords in a lot of circumstances because they're going to do [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6353.18s)]
*  anything to get people out. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6356.14s)]
*  And you can't trust the tenants because they're manipulating the system like this. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6357.5s)]
*  And then some of them are just stuck in the crossfire it's like yo I got a lease from this guy [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6360.700000000001s)]
*  and now I'm in this place. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6363.820000000001s)]
*  That's the craziest scenario. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6364.46s)]
*  You are actually a good citizen you're a good person you're paying the bills. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6365.660000000001s)]
*  You would have paid the landlord. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6369.34s)]
*  You pay cash to this guy every single month. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6370.9400000000005s)]
*  And then he leaves town and you can't get in touch with him. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6374.14s)]
*  As the owner of the place you can't do anything to that person. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6376.860000000001s)]
*  Can't threaten them with violence. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6381.820000000001s)]
*  You can't. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6383.02s)]
*  How? [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6383.660000000001s)]
*  That person's innocent. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6383.9800000000005s)]
*  That shit was infuriating. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6385.26s)]
*  I can imagine. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6387.660000000001s)]
*  But that is our justice system right. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6388.46s)]
*  It's the presumption of innocence. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6389.900000000001s)]
*  And that's why it even has to go to court. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6391.5s)]
*  We know this person is breaking the law. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6393.42s)]
*  You know they're breaking the law. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6394.860000000001s)]
*  They know they're breaking the law. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6395.9800000000005s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6397.02s)]
*  We got it on video. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6397.900000000001s)]
*  We have everything that we need until the court decides that that is the case. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6398.860000000001s)]
*  Which like you said most of the times it does decide that. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6403.26s)]
*  You can't do anything. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6406.78s)]
*  Oh that is wild right. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6407.98s)]
*  And why do you think that this is so popular right now? [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6409.98s)]
*  So this is where it gets interesting. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6412.38s)]
*  So there's a couple things. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6413.82s)]
*  These articles that I read you before. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6414.78s)]
*  Squatter wins the house of a dead woman. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6416.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah all those headlines go crazy. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6417.74s)]
*  If you search like squatter wins home that's like 20 articles. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6419.42s)]
*  And it's this one dude in England which again they kind of like different squatter's rights laws [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6422.62s)]
*  that are like actually go back even farther. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6426.139999999999s)]
*  This is an actual squatter's rights situation. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6428.7s)]
*  So the headline is squatter wins the house of a dead woman. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6431.0199999999995s)]
*  Everyone's pissed off. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6433.58s)]
*  Basically what happens is there's a guy that sees a decrepit house. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6434.86s)]
*  It's all fucked up. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6438.46s)]
*  It's falling apart. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6439.259999999999s)]
*  He's like a contractor working in the neighborhood and this house is just destroyed. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6439.9s)]
*  He asked the people in the neighborhood he's like what's up with this house? [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6442.94s)]
*  And they're like oh it's been this way for like five years. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6444.62s)]
*  It's just like there's rats in it. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6446.7s)]
*  There's crackheads running in and out of it. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6447.98s)]
*  Like it's fucked. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6449.58s)]
*  And he's like oh okay. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6450.94s)]
*  And so he kind of asks around. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6452.3s)]
*  He's trying to see who owns it. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6453.58s)]
*  He can't get in touch with anyone. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6454.86s)]
*  This is 97. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6455.98s)]
*  So he just starts fixing it. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6457.0199999999995s)]
*  And he just starts building up the house. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6458.86s)]
*  And he does it over the course of like three four years. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6461.179999999999s)]
*  Everyone's like wow this is amazing. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6463.66s)]
*  Everyone in the neighborhood really likes it. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6464.94s)]
*  They love it. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6466.0599999999995s)]
*  Now you don't have this decrepit crack house in your neighborhood that's pulling the property value down. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6466.7s)]
*  Literally. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6471.099999999999s)]
*  So then he starts building up the house. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6471.58s)]
*  He doesn't hear anything from anyone. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6472.86s)]
*  Tries to get in touch. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6473.98s)]
*  Can't get in touch with the owner. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6474.86s)]
*  Like no one knows who is actually owning it. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6476.3s)]
*  Calls the bank. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6477.98s)]
*  The bank foreclosed that he was actually like managing with. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6478.54s)]
*  He basically keeps it. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6482.139999999999s)]
*  And then in 2012 the owner comes back and he's like yo what happened to the house? [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6483.5s)]
*  And the guy's like oh. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6487.0199999999995s)]
*  Now the guy that originally owned it is like 80. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6488.86s)]
*  Basically what happened was he was living there with his mom. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6491.0199999999995s)]
*  His mom died in like 1990. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6493.42s)]
*  He ends up moving and going somewhere. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6495.58s)]
*  That leaves the house to ruin. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6498.06s)]
*  This guy finds it fixes it up moves his family in there lives in it becomes a member of the community. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6499.9800000000005s)]
*  And then this dude comes back and he's like yo give me my house back. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6504.86s)]
*  And the guy's like I've been living here bro you haven't been here. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6507.1s)]
*  Didn't the bank foreclose it's not his house anymore. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6509.9800000000005s)]
*  So technically he owned it outright but the bank that gave him the original loan was no longer there. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6512.22s)]
*  So he couldn't get in touch with whoever the actual owner was. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6517.5s)]
*  So it's his house though. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6520.14s)]
*  So according to the law in England at the time I think it was like 10 years. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6521.42s)]
*  So because he had lived in there for 10 years it was his. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6524.78s)]
*  And everyone in the community was like. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6527.9s)]
*  I mean he's a definitional squatter whereas these people are not. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6529.18s)]
*  These are trespassers. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6531.74s)]
*  And I like that this guy allegedly did the due diligence to find the dude. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6533.5s)]
*  Who knows if he actually did. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6537.5s)]
*  He might have just taken advantage of you know an opportunistic situation. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6539.1s)]
*  You're still building up a thing in the community. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6542.3s)]
*  It's good. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6544.38s)]
*  I don't care if it's mine I could let. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6544.78s)]
*  Now I think the community and I think in America the community would have standards [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6546.46s)]
*  for your home for example like you have to cut your lawn. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6551.02s)]
*  What is it the HOA? [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6554.22s)]
*  So like HOA is like hey you have to make sure the outside is more or less clean. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6556.9400000000005s)]
*  The lawn is cut. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6560.46s)]
*  You have a responsibility to your community. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6561.42s)]
*  You can't let it become decrepit. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6563.26s)]
*  And if it does I think the HOA can actually kick you out of the community. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6564.46s)]
*  The city can too. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6567.740000000001s)]
*  Oh sorry. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6568.620000000001s)]
*  There's like city ordinances. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6568.9400000000005s)]
*  Go go go. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6569.900000000001s)]
*  The most infuriating part was when that guy was squatting in my place. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6570.46s)]
*  It was winter time. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6573.9800000000005s)]
*  I still had to go over there and shovel. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6575.1s)]
*  No way. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6577.18s)]
*  Why did you have to shovel? [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6578.38s)]
*  Because the HOA. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6579.660000000001s)]
*  I would get tickets. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6580.86s)]
*  I would get tickets. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6581.66s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6582.62s)]
*  Bro I was so tight. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6583.9s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6585.259999999999s)]
*  He's inside drinking coffee while you're shoveling the fucking front lawn. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6586.46s)]
*  I would have lost it. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6589.339999999999s)]
*  No way. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6590.299999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6591.0199999999995s)]
*  You got too much patience. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6591.259999999999s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6592.46s)]
*  No I got him out. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6592.94s)]
*  Yeah yeah. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6593.98s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6595.42s)]
*  But yeah so there's a circumstance like if you bought some shit which are or you and [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6596.54s)]
*  Harry whatever it is that is yours bro. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6599.82s)]
*  Just because somebody fixed it up don't mean he gets to keep it. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6602.46s)]
*  No that's losses. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6604.94s)]
*  Yeah but then. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6605.98s)]
*  I don't know about all that. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6606.54s)]
*  But then if you let it go and now it's ruining the neighborhood it's like you should be penal. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6607.26s)]
*  That's what I feel. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6611.820000000001s)]
*  No no you should be responsible and the neighborhood should be able to contact you and tell you [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6612.54s)]
*  and give you warnings and say hey if you're not going to do this then we are going to [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6618.14s)]
*  force you to sell the home or whatever it is the bank will hold the money in escrow until [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6622.22s)]
*  you're ready to claim it. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6626.780000000001s)]
*  You can't just let this house become dilapidated but the idea that somebody can just fix your [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6627.9800000000005s)]
*  shit up without you even knowing and he allegedly reached out to you which I don't [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6632.14s)]
*  know if I find that. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6637.02s)]
*  Ten. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6638.540000000001s)]
*  Yeah I think after a certain period I actually like that. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6639.34s)]
*  Ten years you haven't looked at it you don't value it. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6641.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6644.38s)]
*  Well regardless of you value it or not it's yours like somebody in your family works hard [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6644.860000000001s)]
*  to get it. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6648.3s)]
*  You fucking up the neighborhood. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6648.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah yeah you're not valuing what your family worked hard for. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6649.740000000001s)]
*  What I'm saying is I agree with you it shouldn't be taken because he's not there for ten years. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6652.22s)]
*  It should be taken because of what he's doing to his neighbors for ten years. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6658.780000000001s)]
*  And then pay for auction or something. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6662.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah exactly. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6665.02s)]
*  Now like he has enough violations of HOA and then it's given up for auction or whatever [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6665.98s)]
*  the fuck it is and then that money is held for him. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6671.66s)]
*  It's not it's not held by the HOA just held and then when he's ready to claim it he goes [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6675.58s)]
*  and claims it. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6680.219999999999s)]
*  You still I think need to disincentivize neglect. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6680.94s)]
*  Which is the which is the fines what you would get that's what the HOA does. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6684.94s)]
*  So some people do that where some people suggested that they basically put a tax on vacant property [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6688.299999999999s)]
*  that if you leave a property vacant for a certain period of time you have an increased [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6692.78s)]
*  property tax. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6695.74s)]
*  And Florida kind of does the opposite where if you live in the place that you're that you own [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6696.46s)]
*  then you basically get like a homestead tax reduction and you actually like save on taxes [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6701.179999999999s)]
*  by living in the place. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6704.86s)]
*  Because you want to incentivize people to live in that place. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6705.74s)]
*  I just don't like this idea that like you have to go live there especially when it's [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6708.0599999999995s)]
*  an inherited property. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6711.74s)]
*  You don't have to live there you can just have a tenant. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6712.62s)]
*  You just have to keep it up. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6714.219999999999s)]
*  Have someone come mow the lawn. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6715.98s)]
*  Yeah if there's some shit leaking have someone come fix it. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6717.74s)]
*  What I'm saying to you guys is whatever the standard is for the community you should have [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6720.46s)]
*  to uphold that. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6724.379999999999s)]
*  And if you don't then you can go take measures to sell it. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6725.179999999999s)]
*  But just be somebody else upholds the standard of the community and builds up the house doesn't [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6728.219999999999s)]
*  mean it just becomes theirs. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6732.299999999999s)]
*  I don't want to incentivize that. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6733.66s)]
*  It's like let's say the owner of the Empire State Building just like is like fuck it. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6734.7s)]
*  I'm not doing nothing. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6738.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah and it just becomes this decrepit building. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6739.0199999999995s)]
*  Of course in the middle of like the jewel of America. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6741.259999999999s)]
*  We would first of all step in way before that. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6743.82s)]
*  The city would try to do something. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6746.299999999999s)]
*  They would step in and they'd be like listen if you're not going to upkeep this building [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6747.98s)]
*  we're going to keep on finding you and eventually get to the point where you're not paying the [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6751.26s)]
*  fines. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6754.54s)]
*  We're going to auction off this building and then whatever that building makes after [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6754.94s)]
*  it pays off all the fines and all the money that the city had to invest to upkeep it can [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6758.38s)]
*  go into an account and that is hell for you. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6763.1s)]
*  And it's going to be way less than if you built it up real nice and sold it. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6765.18s)]
*  But that is your money it's not the city's money. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6768.22s)]
*  So you're basically saying the city can seize it but a person can't seize it. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6770.0599999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6774.14s)]
*  And by seizing it they're only they're selling it so they're not taking it away. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6774.86s)]
*  They're selling it for whatever value is there and then you get to keep that value. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6780.54s)]
*  But they're basically or they're forcing you to sell it. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6784.38s)]
*  And the first thing is what people do when they kick you out of a community. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6787.1s)]
*  Right. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6790.22s)]
*  I think like Nicki Minaj and her husband is a child sex offender so she had to she got [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6790.46s)]
*  I think kicked out of her community in L.A. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6795.74s)]
*  Did you guys see that story or like the community stepped up and they're like we don't want [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6797.58s)]
*  a sex offender living in our area. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6800.22s)]
*  So I think they forced them to sell their home. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6801.900000000001s)]
*  So they had to sell their home. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6805.02s)]
*  Now if they're not willing to sell I imagine it goes to court and then maybe the court [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6807.26s)]
*  rules that they have to because the community said and then they forcefully sell it. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6811.82s)]
*  But they still get the money for their home. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6815.42s)]
*  You would you enjoy the value going back to the person who owned it. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6817.02s)]
*  Yeah I think that's fair. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6820.22s)]
*  Yeah I just think that's fair. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6821.34s)]
*  I agree. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6822.54s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6822.9400000000005s)]
*  I don't mind it not going back at a certain point that to me it's a lot of it is just [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6823.34s)]
*  tied into the duration like 10 years of neglect is a long time of neglect. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6827.26s)]
*  My issue with the tenants rights in New York is 30 days is not enough to be like no I live [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6831.5s)]
*  here you can't get me out. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6835.66s)]
*  Yeah which is different. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6836.62s)]
*  If that time was a year and squatters rights is 10 years I'm okay with both as if the [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6837.1s)]
*  duration makes sense to me 10 years makes sense to me. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6841.66s)]
*  And that's really all I'm saying if it's 10 years of neglect I don't feel you should [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6844.860000000001s)]
*  be rewarded in any form or fashion for 10 years of neglect. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6848.22s)]
*  All this to say people are reading the headline being like oh some dude went in there while [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6850.62s)]
*  they were on lunch and then stole the place. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6853.5s)]
*  Now it happened. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6855.42s)]
*  Right. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6856.38s)]
*  There's another one that's even more interesting to happen in New York. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6857.18s)]
*  This is the one in Long Island. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6859.66s)]

*  living in a house he owns the house he's an old dude he's got this caretaker that he's [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6872.46s)]
*  paying cash every week to take care of him. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6876.0599999999995s)]
*  The guy basically tells him hey when I die you get the house. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6878.0599999999995s)]
*  The guy dies the caretaker is like sick I got the house which bad incentive don't tell [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6882.0599999999995s)]
*  your caretaker you get some shit if you die. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6886.38s)]
*  So then he dies the guy gets the house he's like all right bet I got this house that's [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6888.46s)]
*  sick. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6891.42s)]
*  The house basically then goes into the ownership of like the trust of the guy. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6892.06s)]
*  This dude that got it just had a verbal agreement that it was his and now he's the tenant he's [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6895.82s)]
*  just living there rent free. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6899.5s)]
*  It now gets sold and then a family buys it. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6901.02s)]
*  The Landis family. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6903.66s)]
*  They have like three kids one of the kids is Down syndrome and they include this in [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6904.94s)]
*  the story to be like this is so fucked up how are you going to do this we're trying [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6907.74s)]
*  to raise our kid and retire in our dream home. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6909.9s)]
*  So now the family goes to try to live in the house and they can't because this tenant is [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6911.9s)]
*  living in there and he has all the legal rights they have to keep on paying rent they [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6917.34s)]
*  have to keep the heat on in the winter time and it's just the whole thing's fucked. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6921.1s)]
*  That's the story. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6924.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6925.26s)]
*  What actually happened is fucking wild. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6926.06s)]
*  Can you guess. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6928.9400000000005s)]
*  No. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6929.82s)]
*  The family that tried to buy the property cooperated with the tenant prior to the sale. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6930.54s)]
*  Then said hey if you stay in the place and cause a problem you will lower the value. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6937.74s)]
*  Because they knew that there was an unruly tenant in the house when they bought it. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6943.5s)]
*  So the original value was like two point eight and what they eventually bought it for was like two. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6947.099999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6952.62s)]
*  And so they basically cooperated with the tenant to say hey you live in here cause a problem use [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6953.099999999999s)]
*  your tenants rights to like fuck up the sale for anyone else that's considering buying it. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6957.0199999999995s)]
*  Drive them out and we will take on the sale knowing that there's an unruly tenant and we'll [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6961.099999999999s)]
*  give you like a hundred grand to do it and then once we come in you got to get the fuck out. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6965.18s)]
*  And the guy was like deal. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6968.3s)]
*  Fire. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6969.98s)]
*  And then they renegotiated on the contract. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6971.18s)]
*  What does that mean then they were. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6973.58s)]
*  So they buy the house for two million and then they go to the guy and say all right get the [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6974.7s)]
*  fuck out. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6977.42s)]
*  And then he says. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6977.98s)]
*  And the guy goes where's the money you promised me a hundred thousand to cause a problem. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6978.7s)]
*  And they go we're not paying you. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6981.98s)]
*  Get the fuck out. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6984.3s)]
*  And the guy's like nah fuck you guys I'm staying here. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6986.139999999999s)]
*  Pay me my money. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6989.099999999999s)]
*  And they're like no we're not doing it. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6990.3s)]
*  They call the police they try to get them out they try to go through like the legal way to get a [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6991.58s)]
*  tenant out and thinking like yeah it'll cost us like 40 grand to get them out so we'll pay 40 [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6994.54s)]
*  grand to the city instead of 100 grand to this guy. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=6998.94s)]
*  They tried to fuck him. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7000.86s)]
*  And so the guy's like nah fuck it I'm staying here. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7002.54s)]
*  And he stays. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7004.54s)]
*  And basically runs up this whole thing and then the family goes to the paper and they're like [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7006.22s)]
*  these squatters rights these tenants they're fucking going wild. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7009.9800000000005s)]
*  This family is a piece of fucking. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7013.9800000000005s)]
*  Now again this is coming from that guy's attorney. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7016.14s)]
*  So this is the attorney from the squatter that's saying that this is what happened. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7018.86s)]
*  No one really knows because it hasn't gone to court yet the guy's still living in the house. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7022.94s)]
*  So the guy the caretaker was he the squatter. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7027.74s)]
*  Yeah different. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7029.82s)]
*  Okay. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7030.38s)]
*  The caretaker was squatter. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7031.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7032.22s)]
*  And apparently the lawyer has like a one hour phone call recording with the owners the new [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7032.62s)]
*  owners to basically like set up this conspiracy. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7038.62s)]
*  Holy shit. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7041.26s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7042.22s)]
*  That's the thing you can't trust motherfuckers that are willing to do this. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7042.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7045.099999999999s)]
*  Like if they're willing to screw these people over they're willing to screw you over. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7045.5s)]
*  You need everything in writing. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7048.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7050.22s)]
*  And I'll throw a bunch of allegedly's on this I don't know what the actual details are this [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7050.46s)]
*  is just what one article I read. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7053.74s)]
*  What an absolute scumbag. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7055.099999999999s)]
*  You can't trust a single headline anymore. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7056.7s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7058.38s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7059.58s)]
*  Just the story. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7059.9s)]
*  Let's say if the story is false like I guarantee people are going to try to do this when they [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7060.7s)]
*  go to buy a house. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7065.66s)]
*  Oh wow. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7066.7s)]
*  Like yeah you're incentivized like you know I can get so much cut off this house I just [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7067.74s)]
*  have to find a find a house who's like rent or rent to buy. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7073.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7077.259999999999s)]
*  And then both. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7077.58s)]
*  This is not the same thing at all but the more information you have going into like [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7078.46s)]
*  purchase a home you know the the better you are negotiating right. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7083.42s)]
*  Like a friend of mine was purchasing an apartment and he did his due diligence. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7088.3s)]
*  He found we all know him and he found out that it was being sold by a trust and it was [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7093.9800000000005s)]
*  an inheritance trust. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7102.46s)]
*  So the person dies the home like in this situation goes into the trust. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7104.54s)]
*  There's executors of the trust right. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7109.820000000001s)]
*  Someone whose job it is to like divvy up all the things that that person has and then [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7112.14s)]
*  usually what they do is they sell the property and then disperse the capital through all [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7116.9400000000005s)]
*  the brothers or sisters or nieces and nephews whatever. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7122.06s)]
*  When you get something inherited to you and it's only coming in as cash you're not as [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7126.860000000001s)]
*  closely tied to the amount that it's worth because it was zero to you. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7132.3s)]
*  And you're splitting it between five people. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7138.54s)]
*  The second he found out about that he starts bullying them on the price. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7140.62s)]
*  He's like oh these guys just want money quick. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7143.98s)]
*  Yeah they don't want to waste time. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7146.219999999999s)]
*  This means nothing. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7147.74s)]
*  They're selling your home. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7148.54s)]
*  That's my home. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7150.139999999999s)]
*  I love what you put into it and what it means to you. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7150.94s)]
*  It's also you might need that money to buy a different home right. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7152.94s)]
*  So he finds out this information and he bullies them fucking down and it makes sense [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7157.099999999999s)]
*  because again this money to them is free. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7163.58s)]
*  They had zero dollars. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7165.98s)]
*  Yeah these are family members and now they're standing to make who knows maybe a hundred [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7167.259999999999s)]
*  thousand each. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7170.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7171.82s)]
*  You're like okay so I could make a hundred thousand now or I could make eighty five [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7172.14s)]
*  thousand. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7177.02s)]
*  I can make a hundred thousand potentially two months from now when I keep negotiating [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7177.42s)]
*  maybe this deal falls apart. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7180.860000000001s)]
*  Maybe there's another deal that happens maybe that deal falls apart. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7182.22s)]
*  In the meantime I got to pay the dues for the apartment. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7184.780000000001s)]
*  I got to upkeep this apartment. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7186.9400000000005s)]
*  Now I have responsibilities to the apartment that I didn't have before or I can make eighty [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7188.38s)]
*  five grand right now and no issue. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7192.780000000001s)]
*  Fucking smart. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7194.780000000001s)]
*  Yep. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7195.660000000001s)]
*  So all these headlines generally not all. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7199.02s)]
*  I'm not going to say all but a lot of the headlines it seems like are kind of like out [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7201.34s)]
*  of context or cherry picture lack the nuance. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7204.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7206.860000000001s)]
*  And they just enrage people. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7207.26s)]
*  So I was people get fucking fired. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7209.1s)]
*  I was talking to Rogan about this and I wonder if OK you know how like our parents maybe [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7211.1s)]
*  my parents are a little different but like they can't really discern between like a Nigerian [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7215.82s)]
*  prince calling them and asking for tax money and then saying that they're going to make [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7220.78s)]
*  three million. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7224.3s)]
*  They can't really discern between that and like a real call from AT&T that's saying hey [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7226.06s)]
*  your bill is past due. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7230.7s)]
*  Like my parents are better than me dude. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7231.9s)]
*  They grew up in scams. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7233.26s)]
*  OK fair enough. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7234.22s)]
*  But like what I'm the point I'm trying to make is a an older generation is more used [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7235.42s)]
*  to the people that call their phone calling with truthful information. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7240.7s)]
*  Right. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7245.58s)]
*  And asking them and helping them about something. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7245.9s)]
*  Ah yeah. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7247.98s)]
*  Right. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7249.099999999999s)]
*  Can baseline is that OK. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7249.58s)]
*  OK. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7251.0199999999995s)]
*  I think we're in this generation where we were raised knowing there are some scams but at [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7253.58s)]
*  least when it comes to the news we saw headlines we kind of trusted right. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7260.22s)]
*  And now our eyes are opening like our parents eyes are opening to Nigerian scams like my [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7265.34s)]
*  mom might get a call now she's like what do you mean this is I don't even have an AT&T [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7269.58s)]
*  phone. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7273.34s)]
*  Wait why. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7273.58s)]
*  This is a scam I'm hanging up. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7275.26s)]
*  We're doing that with news. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7277.34s)]
*  Our parents aren't there with news. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7279.820000000001s)]
*  They trust news. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7281.1s)]
*  They see this headline. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7281.900000000001s)]
*  This is what the fuck it is. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7282.9400000000005s)]
*  We're going through this with news or like oh I don't know if I can really trust headlines. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7284.780000000001s)]
*  I hope my hope is that the generation below us. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7288.94s)]
*  I think they do. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7294.3s)]
*  Sees every headline and reads it with the same scrutiny that we will hear a Nigerian [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7295.5s)]
*  prince phone caller or email scam. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7301.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7304.06s)]
*  They have high school classes about this. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7304.14s)]
*  Oh so. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7305.74s)]
*  So so so my concern was you know we're fucked you can't believe a single thing. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7306.46s)]
*  We're only fucked if the people knee jerk believe the headlines. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7310.46s)]
*  If the kids growing up know that all headlines are bullshit and they're just made for clicks [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7315.42s)]
*  which they will because they grew up on YouTube. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7320.22s)]
*  We grew up learning about these phone scams. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7323.74s)]
*  And it's not even scam it's like they're on YouTube clicking on things. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7325.58s)]
*  And they're watching the video going oh it's not really what that thumbnail may seem like. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7330.3s)]
*  The way you saw your parents like get scammed or the other phone and you're like mom like [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7333.9s)]
*  you're not actually talking to a guy. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7338.14s)]
*  They're like I think our younger generation will see their parents being like you really believe. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7339.5s)]
*  You believe headlines. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7344.54s)]
*  You believe the news. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7345.82s)]
*  Just because they said this you really you're getting [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7347.58s)]
*  annoyed about it and fired up. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7349.42s)]
*  Like it's obviously not true. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7350.78s)]
*  Yes. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7351.82s)]
*  So that makes me feel a little bit more comfortable and a little bit more hopeful [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7352.22s)]
*  because the idea of just like every single headline that we read that is enticing is fake. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7358.14s)]
*  It is 10 for 10. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7365.1s)]
*  Every headline that is enticing is fake. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7366.94s)]
*  How crazy is that. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7369.82s)]
*  Yeah or it just lacks nuance. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7371.98s)]
*  Technically this guy did take a dead woman's home. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7373.42s)]
*  Okay. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7375.9800000000005s)]
*  This caretaker did walk and find a way to come up with the best YouTube title. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7377.42s)]
*  Yes. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7381.900000000001s)]
*  And it's like when I say fake it is true in that the words can be interpreted in a way that's true. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7384.06s)]
*  But the way that it is presented they are putting it out there in the world in a way that they know [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7391.820000000001s)]
*  it will be misinterpreted for their benefit. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7398.38s)]
*  Whatever gets the most clicks. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7400.9400000000005s)]
*  My wife is in journalism school at NYU was got a masters. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7402.06s)]
*  She learned she's like it is what gets the most clicks and is still true enough. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7406.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7411.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7412.22s)]
*  True enough. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7412.54s)]
*  I tell the story true enough. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7413.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7414.3s)]
*  And let's get the most clicks. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7414.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7415.740000000001s)]
*  But now these kids will know that and ideally will be kind of good and they just won't click on shit [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7416.3s)]
*  or they'll click on it with skepticism which maybe is good. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7420.06s)]
*  I probably should do that. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7423.580000000001s)]
*  That's good. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7424.54s)]
*  Have you heard that thing like if there's a question and a headline the answer is almost always no. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7425.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7429.02s)]
*  Is Bill Gates really a lizard. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7430.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7432.9400000000005s)]
*  No. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7433.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7433.66s)]
*  I feel like some journalism professor like it's like the Zimmerman rule or some shit like if [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7433.820000000001s)]
*  something is has a question it's like yeah probably not. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7437.9800000000005s)]
*  One thing I'm starting to realize is that like let's say these squatters rights we're seeing [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7440.46s)]
*  so many headlines about it but I'm realizing the problem is never as bad as what the news is making [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7445.820000000001s)]
*  it. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7450.860000000001s)]
*  Like had the way that they're talking about crime in New York crime is almost at an all time low. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7451.42s)]
*  Really. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7457.58s)]
*  But if you look at news and what the headlines are you think it's great. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7458.7s)]
*  Get punched in the face. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7462.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7463.58s)]
*  So it's really it's been better than. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7464.3s)]
*  I'm going to piss my pants. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7466.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7467.42s)]
*  I was talking to Rogan about this too like he was like how is New York and I'm sure well he's not [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7467.820000000001s)]
*  here he's just consuming content about New York and the content looks wild. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7472.3s)]
*  He's like but like have you noticed the migrants or whatever and I was like Joe New York is the [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7476.38s)]
*  most diverse city in the world. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7480.9400000000005s)]
*  It is physically impossible to notice. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7482.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7485.82s)]
*  It's just it's just not possible. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7485.98s)]
*  Like if you lived in like the white if you lived in Montana. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7488.299999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7492.7s)]
*  And all of a sudden a bunch of fucking Sudanese people are walking around. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7493.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7496.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7497.099999999999s)]
*  You'd notice them. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7497.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7498.219999999999s)]
*  If you're in New York on a bus with Mexicans you're in Spanish Harlem. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7498.46s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7500.94s)]
*  You just it is not physically possible. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7502.139999999999s)]
*  So for people who are like oh the city's completely changed one those people probably [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7504.62s)]
*  let's say the city has gotten objectively more dangerous have you seen more crime. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7509.66s)]
*  That is for people who probably haven't been here for 20 years. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7514.7s)]
*  I've been here for 40 years so I've seen it in ways that are so much more dangerous [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7519.5s)]
*  that it would blow all your mind. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7524.46s)]
*  New York is a fucking Apple store compared to when we grew up. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7526.139999999999s)]
*  How was Lower East Side when you were growing up? [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7528.94s)]
*  Dude. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7530.54s)]
*  How was Williamsburg? [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7531.66s)]
*  When you were growing up? [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7532.46s)]
*  It's Williamsburg was just straight Jewish like this idea like we would drive through [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7533.179999999999s)]
*  it my dad would drive through it. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7537.98s)]
*  Trying to hit him. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7539.179999999999s)]
*  No, no, he would just be like hey I want you to I want you to see this this is like a mate [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7539.82s)]
*  look at this city like there's this group of people that are living a completely different [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7545.58s)]
*  life they're all dressing a different way and he was just like look how amazing this is like [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7549.34s)]
*  this is not even that far from where you live look at this and we would drive through it. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7553.099999999999s)]
*  I remember we were going out to the beach and but like he would purposely want us to [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7557.58s)]
*  drive through the section that's always really cool but but yeah this idea that it's different [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7561.9s)]
*  it's just it's impossible for New York to be more dangerous than it was when I was growing [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7567.42s)]
*  it like I can't even I can't even like the way that New York was dangerous and and and that is [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7572.78s)]
*  when it was safe. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7579.0199999999995s)]
*  New York in the 70s people are breaking into your home you know all the bars and the windows in [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7580.38s)]
*  the buildings it's because you would show up and there'd be a Dominican guy in your living room [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7586.0599999999995s)]
*  just like ransacking your silverware. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7590.3s)]

*  Dude I I told you this before where like my middle school said don't if anybody asks you the time [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7635.26s)]

*  please do not wear red and if anybody asks you the time do not tell them because they're going to use [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7644.86s)]
*  that as an opportunity to slash your face. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7648.94s)]
*  We were 12. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7650.62s)]
*  Crazy. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7651.9s)]
*  So like this idea like oh my god New York is so dangerous. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7652.46s)]
*  Yeah for you guys that came from Maine when we grew up here the level of danger was compared [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7654.94s)]
*  to what people are used to now was in incomparable. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7663.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7667.5s)]
*  Yeah it's not even close. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7667.74s)]
*  That's why I just hate the media how they're just like scaring people and making it seem like it's [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7669.66s)]
*  horrible and it's really not and but then you trick the people who don't have the new elements [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7674.7s)]
*  like the older generation. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7680.22s)]
*  My mom thinks New York is crazy right now. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7681.58s)]
*  So crime is lower than it was 10 years because when I moved I moved to New York in 08 [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7683.5s)]
*  and I'm like I think I was moved in the safest time that's ever been in New York from 08 till [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7687.820000000001s)]
*  2020. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7693.740000000001s)]
*  I was like this is I dude I would walk New York comedy club was what 24th and second I would walk [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7694.62s)]
*  home 50th and 8th 2 in the morning Saturday I wouldn't give a fuck. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7699.1s)]
*  Still the same. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7702.22s)]
*  Still the same. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7703.740000000001s)]
*  I would say train feels 2020. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7704.3s)]
*  Train vibes feel different to me if I'm on the train the whole energy feels different to me. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7706.06s)]
*  I think that what people are reacting to a lot more in New York is just I think during [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7710.38s)]
*  covid they had to let the crazies out or something and I think that's it. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7714.780000000001s)]
*  Like when you see more crazy people on the street that's fear inducing because you don't [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7719.1s)]
*  know what they're going to do or what they got. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7724.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7726.9400000000005s)]
*  So when I see a crazy person I assume they got AIDS everyone and fighting a dude with AIDS is [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7727.02s)]
*  crazy. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7733.02s)]
*  Yeah because even if you win you lose. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7733.5s)]
*  You lose that fight. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7734.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7736.14s)]
*  But in terms of like so fun I think like every crazy person got AIDS. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7737.74s)]
*  Yep. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7741.34s)]
*  And then we saw this homeless guy like slapped his girl or something I'm like what the fuck [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7742.7s)]
*  are you doing and then he kind of runs off and then Andrew was like dude what are you doing [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7746.139999999999s)]
*  that guy could like have AIDS. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7749.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7750.219999999999s)]
*  That's the first thing. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7750.54s)]
*  You don't engage. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7752.7s)]
*  Don't engage. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7753.5s)]
*  Son 100 percent. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7754.219999999999s)]
*  No that's the thing I do with the call you know someone just call the police. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7755.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7758.38s)]
*  If I see crazy people like especially like a crazy drug couple beefing I just say yo [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7758.62s)]
*  someone just call the police they're coming to get and then they usually chill out. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7762.38s)]
*  Crazy people. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7766.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7766.7s)]
*  And I think there's more crazy people and I think that's because it was during COVID [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7767.0199999999995s)]
*  they couldn't lock them up or something. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7770.0599999999995s)]
*  What was the crazy. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7772.38s)]
*  I mean this goes probably. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7772.94s)]
*  This goes back to deinstitutionalization which was like shutting down psych wards in [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7774.38s)]
*  the 70s and 80s and this is sort of like a long term effect of that apparently. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7779.98s)]
*  Well something I've been reading up on and also everything was closed so the few places [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7783.9s)]
*  that people couldn't get together you're more congested. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7788.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7791.34s)]
*  People aren't going to school you're not doing stuff you're not getting the energy out and it [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7791.74s)]
*  was a tough time for a lot of people so yeah you're going to have an increase in crime. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7795.34s)]
*  This is the end of the world. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7799.74s)]
*  You need to you need to punish crime like I was speaking to even some cops I was like yo what's [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7801.18s)]
*  up like what like what do you guys think is going on he goes the problem is like we arrest them and [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7804.7s)]
*  then they don't get they don't. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7808.860000000001s)]
*  The DA. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7811.58s)]
*  Yeah yeah they don't we arrest them and then they get released it's like a catch release [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7812.3s)]
*  situation they don't. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7816.860000000001s)]
*  Post called. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7817.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7818.14s)]
*  No post bail. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7818.54s)]
*  Yeah but they don't actually punish them for the crimes like they don't actually take them to [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7819.66s)]
*  court so they know that so there's really there's no way to disincentivize them from. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7823.58s)]
*  Remember that. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7827.74s)]
*  Freakonomics. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7828.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7829.5s)]
*  Just like statistically went through like they theories and they talked about broken [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7829.74s)]
*  window theory and like statistically didn't make that big of an impact. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7833.42s)]
*  Biggest thing they said that made New York safer was locking up criminals [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7835.98s)]
*  more criminals for longer and I'm sure that has negative effects as well [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7839.0199999999995s)]
*  but in general that was the biggest statistical driver toward a safer New York. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7842.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7846.86s)]
*  So yeah we need to actually punish crimes if you do something illegal you should be punished for it. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7847.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7852.7s)]
*  Simple as that. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7852.94s)]
*  Everyone agrees with it. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7853.82s)]
*  Everybody agrees with it. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7854.78s)]
*  You have Rikers that's just overpopulated but then no one wants to build more prisons [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7856.0599999999995s)]
*  in their backyard so it's like how can we lock up more people. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7860.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7864.219999999999s)]
*  100%. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7865.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7865.5s)]
*  So yeah. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7866.0599999999995s)]
*  Sorry anecdotally I do this isn't crime but I do like I see way more just like heroin being [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7866.86s)]
*  shot up out on the streets I remember walking I don't know where I was walking one day but I saw [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7871.98s)]
*  like three different groups of people shooting up heroin saw a homeless guy with just like shit on [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7875.98s)]
*  him piece of intestine coming out of it. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7881.18s)]
*  It was like it was more aware. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7882.9400000000005s)]
*  No. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7885.900000000001s)]
*  I think when you were young and hungry. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7886.22s)]
*  Buddy I moved here at 25. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7888.22s)]
*  No but he moved at the peak. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7889.26s)]
*  See I moved in the safe. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7891.58s)]
*  He doesn't know like you're like a lot of people which like you don't know New York as dangerous. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7892.54s)]
*  Yeah I know what it was I know I didn't move at that time I know I moved when it was safe [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7898.700000000001s)]
*  and I don't think it's what it was but I think it's not as safe as it was when I moved here. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7904.06s)]
*  Homelessness was. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7908.22s)]
*  I think 08-19. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7908.780000000001s)]
*  Super high. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7909.740000000001s)]
*  It's at the highest since the Great Depression. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7910.54s)]
*  What is in New York. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7912.3s)]
*  Homelessness in New York. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7913.1s)]
*  You know probably but there's other squatters rights to people. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7913.74s)]
*  There's the other thing with the homelessness which is like [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7917.1s)]
*  and I think we spoke about this on the pod but like New York has a right to shelter it's the [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7921.74s)]
*  biggest city it's the only big city in the country that has a right to shelter program [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7926.06s)]
*  which is for our homeless but now the migrants found out about it and they're like yo if we're [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7929.74s)]
*  in America we might as well go to that place that puts you up in a fucking home or a nice hotel. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7934.06s)]
*  That's way better than just living on the street in Arizona. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7938.62s)]
*  I'd rather go to New York and live in the fucking Pennsylvania hotel or whatever the [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7941.0199999999995s)]
*  shit is across from MSG that's completely filled with migrants. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7944.38s)]
*  So they're taking advantage of a homeless policy that was already at its limit and now we have [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7947.18s)]
*  50 percent more people in that program and no more beds. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7952.14s)]
*  So it is a manipulation it is fucked up and it's not for them and they're taking advantage of it [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7957.099999999999s)]
*  and they're taking beds from people who are actually homeless in New York and dealing with [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7962.14s)]
*  things and homelessness isn't something that you exist in full time you can fluctuate in and out [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7966.38s)]
*  of homelessness and the idea of giving somebody a shelter or giving somebody a roof is maybe they [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7970.62s)]
*  can get back on their feet they can't get a job and they can get back in the workforce. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7975.18s)]
*  So there are all these different things that like combines make it look crazier [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7979.26s)]
*  but what we're used to the crazy of like the fucking insane crazy that this city was growing up [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7983.34s)]
*  I'm sorry it's not there. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7991.900000000001s)]
*  I think most of us know it's not but I don't think people want it to get back. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7993.02s)]
*  I don't think so. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7996.3s)]
*  I don't think so Akash. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7997.660000000001s)]
*  I actually think in the same way that like we look at LA and we look at San Francisco [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=7998.540000000001s)]
*  we look at Portland and we're like what the fuck has happened to these cities [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8002.620000000001s)]
*  the people from there don't look at it like that. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8005.580000000001s)]
*  Like when I was in LA and I was asking people about it they're like [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8008.9400000000005s)]
*  no we don't really notice that big a deal like yeah it was a little bit whatever but [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8011.900000000001s)]
*  it's not that crazy but if you look at how we view LA and how everybody outside LA were like [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8015.820000000001s)]
*  there's tents everywhere every part of it's destroyed they're all drug addicts. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8021.0199999999995s)]
*  You're asking an LA person they're like yeah we're not in New York. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8024.379999999999s)]
*  They literally said we're not San Francisco like you don't one you're used to it you've [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8027.74s)]
*  compartmentalized it in your brain you're like yeah there's the skid row tent thing [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8034.0599999999995s)]
*  so it doesn't really affect us but the way that the world is putting out information [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8037.82s)]
*  and the world is consuming it without having anything to reject it is completely different [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8041.98s)]
*  and that's the case with New York as well. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8046.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah so there's this kid actually that's trying to like fight homelessness it's very interesting [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8047.9s)]
*  Australian kid and he's been picked up by all the right-wing media sites because his thing [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8051.82s)]
*  is he posts the address of vacant homes. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8056.0599999999995s)]
*  He's Australian dude his name is Geordi I believe he posts like all these addresses in Australia [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8059.66s)]
*  like hey guys vacant homes if anyone wants to go and squat in these you can and he's like [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8065.0199999999995s)]
*  being like the point person to get the homeless people or people that want homes into vacant homes. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8070.86s)]
*  And he's like ideologically like vacant homes are theft and you shouldn't have vacant homes [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8077.660000000001s)]
*  and it's fucked up and he's like anti-landlord type vibe I think I don't want to miscarry. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8081.9800000000005s)]
*  Wow that's interesting. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8086.22s)]
*  And so he's just like yo go take these homes. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8087.660000000001s)]
*  We gotta take this kid out. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8089.660000000001s)]
*  How long have you been making this? [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8092.3s)]
*  It's been a while. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8093.18s)]
*  That's the limit. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8093.660000000001s)]
*  10 years it could happen. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8095.900000000001s)]
*  So all this is a my assumption of this in my opinion obviously squatting is fucked up [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8098.06s)]
*  obviously people that are like doing this shit aren't even squatting they're just breaking [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8102.46s)]
*  and entering or trespassing for extended periods of time or hold over tenants and that's fucked up [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8105.66s)]
*  and there should be a way for landlords to get people out in a speedy manner that actually [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8109.34s)]
*  preserves their property. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8113.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8115.099999999999s)]
*  But I think a lot of this is getting picked up right now because it's an election year [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8115.58s)]
*  and I think that these stories specifically resonate with one specific political aisle [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8119.74s)]
*  and they're like oh this is fucked up. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8123.42s)]
*  100%. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8124.94s)]
*  Tenants are crazy the entitlement from these people these drug addicts da da da [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8125.9s)]
*  and it's getting people emotionally fired up in a time where you need to be able to vote. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8129.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah I mean who do you think is going to handle tenants better than Donald Trump? [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8132.459999999999s)]
*  Like if there's one person that is literally built to solve this problem it's the guy that [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8139.339999999999s)]
*  spent the majority of his life dealing with tenants. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8143.98s)]
*  You're fired. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8146.62s)]
*  Yeah that guy. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8147.259999999999s)]
*  You know so yeah wow. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8148.459999999999s)]
*  Oh so yeah that's what I think. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8150.459999999999s)]
*  I wonder if that's an interesting strategy if you could like emboldened if you could prop up [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8151.98s)]
*  certain stories that have kind of always percolated but never really had the spotlight on them or [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8156.459999999999s)]
*  attention if you could prop up the stories that people subconsciously feel like your like their [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8161.58s)]
*  candidate would solve. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8167.98s)]
*  So now you don't even need to go vote for Trump. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8170.14s)]
*  Migrant crisis. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8172.14s)]
*  Yeah of course of course right. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8172.94s)]
*  It's a building wall. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8174.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8175.0199999999995s)]
*  The squattings right. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8176.3s)]
*  Critical race theory. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8177.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8178.7s)]
*  So it's like that's a really subversive way to get people to vote for you without telling them [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8179.1s)]
*  because back in the day ads are like there's a problem this guy's going to solve it. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8185.34s)]
*  Now you actually separate the guy and the problem. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8189.74s)]
*  You already know what he's synonymous for build up these problems and then have them look for hope [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8192.38s)]
*  and then you go oh that guy's probably more hopeful at solving those problems. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8197.74s)]
*  And then they feel they've made the decision. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8201.66s)]
*  And it doesn't feel like an ad. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8203.58s)]
*  It doesn't feel like an ad. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8205.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8206.46s)]
*  That is subversive. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8206.94s)]
*  Some people do it even more. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8207.98s)]
*  This guy's half on crime and so now let's make everybody feel like crime is up. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8209.02s)]
*  Yeah exactly. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8212.94s)]
*  Some people even more subversive. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8213.9s)]
*  Remember that documentary Great Hack. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8215.58s)]
*  It was like about Russian interference in the elections. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8217.26s)]
*  There was this guy that in one specific place in Alabama I believe he was a Democrat guy [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8221.26s)]
*  and he was like or Democrat like lobbyist he was like working for the Democrats trying to [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8227.34s)]
*  get a Democrat guy elected. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8231.02s)]
*  He started running Facebook ads saying that the Republican dude was going to ban alcohol. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8232.460000000001s)]
*  So he was like vote for you know Roy what's his name. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8237.02s)]
*  He's going to ban alcohol turn Alabama into a dry state. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8240.06s)]
*  This is what we need to preserve our Christian America. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8242.86s)]
*  And middle ground like Republicans were like fuck that. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8246.06s)]
*  And they're like what the fuck. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8249.34s)]
*  Oh that's genius. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8250.380000000001s)]
*  Like I don't want these gay people. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8251.26s)]
*  I have a thousand percent fall for that. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8252.300000000001s)]
*  But I want to drink a beer at a football game. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8253.9s)]
*  And it seems pure because the guy's going vote for him. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8256.06s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8259.1s)]
*  Yeah it's not it is actually an attack ad. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8259.58s)]
*  Literally. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8263.42s)]
*  But it is veiled as support. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8263.74s)]
*  Miscarriage. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8265.82s)]
*  So as a result all these like middle of the road Republicans were like all right. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8267.98s)]
*  That's too extreme. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8271.34s)]
*  This guy let me go for this Democrat dude. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8271.98s)]
*  And he was able he was able to say like OK the ad got like you know two million clicks [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8274.3s)]
*  or some shit like that. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8280.22s)]
*  That specific election decided like the state and that election was won by one percent. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8281.26s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8286.46s)]
*  So he's like he swayed the election. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8287.74s)]
*  He believes he's like through Facebook ads and through like mischaracterizing the opponent. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8289.1s)]
*  I was able to sway that. [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8293.02s)]
*  I'm surprised it doesn't happen more. [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8293.82s)]
*  What year is it? [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8295.1s)]
*  Especially with the super PACs they're not supposed to be in contact with the candidate. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8295.58s)]
*  Like you see the shit that happened with RFK that he didn't know about the commercial. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8299.26s)]
*  But it's like if hey if the super PAC does some shit it's like I know. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8302.78s)]
*  I'm surprised it doesn't happen. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8307.820000000002s)]
*  I bet you it does. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8309.66s)]
*  I bet you some of the conversations we're having right now have been manipulated by it [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8310.78s)]
*  because you can throw bots at it. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8314.62s)]
*  Like that's the other thing like you can make stories seem way bigger than they are. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8316.62s)]
*  You can make comments seem way more than they are just by throwing bots at it. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8319.58s)]
*  So the views are up the shares. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8322.54s)]
*  I don't know if you know the bots can share. [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8324.460000000001s)]
*  Maybe they can. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8325.980000000001s)]
*  I don't know but they can definitely game the algo. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8326.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8329.1s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8330.140000000001s)]
*  That's that's really interesting. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8330.460000000001s)]
*  Now I'm looking at this like what are they doing for Biden? [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8332.539999999999s)]
*  Like why aren't the Democrats obviously or if the Republicans are doing the Democrats are doing [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8335.74s)]
*  maybe they're doing different ways. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8339.26s)]
*  So what are the stories that they're promoting that make us feel like Biden would solve these [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8340.46s)]
*  problems better? [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8345.18s)]
*  No they're doing the anti-Trump stories. [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8345.98s)]
*  So he's a criminal. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8348.3s)]
*  He's indicted. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8349.58s)]
*  He's this he's that. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8350.38s)]
*  Then they're not playing the game right now because it's more subversive. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8350.779999999999s)]
*  You got to go out abortion rights again. [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8354.14s)]
*  Oh because that actually did that. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8356.699999999999s)]
*  That's the reason they won the mid everybody thought Republicans are going to wash [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8358.3s)]
*  Democrats in the midterms. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8361.42s)]
*  Then the abortion Supreme Court ruling happened. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8362.78s)]
*  Oh gosh that's fucking good. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8364.7s)]
*  And people were like and I saw it. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8365.82s)]
*  We all saw it happen in real time where it's like oh that's the only reason they they won. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8368.06s)]
*  That's where they got more seats than everybody thought. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8373.58s)]
*  And Trump just had a misstep. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8375.34s)]
*  I feel like he went on truth social and was like oh I'm the guy I'm the reason for [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8376.86s)]
*  Roe v. Wade being overturned. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8383.58s)]
*  Like he like he doubled down. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8385.18s)]
*  He doubled down. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8386.62s)]
*  He said but it should be up to the states and he said I also believe in exceptions for [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8387.26s)]
*  incest. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8391.18s)]
*  I'm pretty sure he said that which. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8391.820000000002s)]
*  Hardcore people don't fuck with that. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8394.94s)]
*  But I think a lot of moderate people will be like okay. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8396.220000000001s)]
*  But that was the miscalculation from the archers just talking about where [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8398.220000000001s)]
*  where there was supposed to be this red wave and they really leaned into anti-abortion [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8401.58s)]
*  propaganda and or just the philosophy of anti-abortion and it didn't really reflect in [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8405.980000000001s)]
*  the polls. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8411.66s)]
*  If that Supreme Court ruling happened six months later they had their seats done. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8412.060000000001s)]
*  I think that a lot of maybe the Republican think tank started to go uh oh maybe Republicans [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8417.42s)]
*  don't really care that much about abortion. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8423.26s)]
*  Or it seems like he's trying to play both sides on this one. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8425.980000000001s)]
*  Yeah I'm responsible for taking it away but then also I'm like how do you guys can do [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8428.7s)]
*  your thing. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8433.02s)]
*  That is the fucking game though. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8433.5s)]
*  I never considered that. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8434.94s)]
*  You don't need to pitch a candidate once the candidate is known and what his beliefs are. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8436.380000000001s)]
*  You need to pitch a candidate when you don't know what they stand for. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8442.62s)]
*  Everybody kind of knows Trump and what he stands for already. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8445.42s)]
*  So the marketing can be even more subversive. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8447.98s)]
*  Convince people that they should be afraid of these things that this guy can solve better [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8451.34s)]
*  without even connecting them to this guy. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8457.42s)]
*  You know that's that's some really interesting shit. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8461.18s)]
*  Like if Biden is going to be soft on China convince us that China is the biggest threat [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8465.26s)]
*  to our country and our democracy. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8471.34s)]
*  Well we already know what Biden is going to do. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8473.42s)]
*  But we all we know that guy Trump was going to be hard on China. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8476.14s)]
*  So I guess I have to. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8480.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah that would work on me. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8482.06s)]
*  That's a fear I have. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8483.42s)]
*  It's like you could look fear. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8484.14s)]
*  You've seen it. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8485.82s)]
*  You've seen it a lot of times happen with with Jews in Israel right. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8486.460000000001s)]
*  That is a really important thing for them and they're looking at the two candidates [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8490.62s)]
*  and they're like you even saw Michael Rappaport who's literally shit non-stop on Trump for [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8494.7s)]
*  fucking eight years. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8499.26s)]
*  Now because of what's happening in Israel Palestine he's like voting for Donald Trump [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8500.939999999999s)]
*  is on the table. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8504.859999999999s)]
*  He's called Donald Dickstein Donald Trump the biggest corrupt the worst motherfucker [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8505.9s)]
*  for eight years now. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8509.82s)]
*  And because Donald Trump has been more supportive of Israel than he believes the Biden administration [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8511.26s)]
*  has been he's like now that's on the table. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8516.06s)]
*  So Trump doesn't even have to go hey vote for me because the problem exists here and [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8520.06s)]
*  they're looking for the solution and they just pick one or the other. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8524.939999999999s)]
*  It's kind of like a really subversive. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8528.46s)]
*  That's the game we're all part of it. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8531.339999999998s)]
*  It really is. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8532.939999999999s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8533.58s)]
*  And we're all gameable. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8534.46s)]
*  Yeah we're all gameable. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8535.66s)]
*  And when you my like rule is like when I feel myself being like oh this is fucked up. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8538.38s)]
*  It ain't. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8544.46s)]
*  That's when I'm like wait a second. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8545.019999999999s)]
*  Yeah what's going on. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8546.46s)]
*  Like when I feel myself in an emotional trigger that's when I'm like all right. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8548.06s)]
*  We are our parents with the fucking call. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8550.939999999999s)]
*  When I feel like getting 10 million dollars from a Nigerian prince is too good. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8553.74s)]
*  I got to look into this when it feels too good to be true. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8558.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8562.38s)]
*  Yeah when the story feels too so late. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8562.699999999999s)]
*  Transpensability I was like what the fuck. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8564.22s)]
*  I spoke about that in Rogan. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8566.539999999999s)]
*  It's so funny people refuse people. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8567.74s)]
*  This is how echo this how terrifying echo chambers are. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8571.179999999998s)]
*  I spoke around Rogan and I spoke about it. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8575.5s)]
*  I thought quite comprehensively. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8577.5s)]
*  I was like guys this is not by design by the administration. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8579.259999999998s)]
*  They don't I doubt they even want this. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8582.939999999999s)]
*  They double down on it. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8585.259999999998s)]
*  They double down on it because it was already a thing. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8586.619999999999s)]
*  They didn't write like if it wasn't a thing they wouldn't have doubled down on it. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8590.619999999999s)]
*  They wouldn't have switched it to replace Easter. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8594.06s)]
*  They wouldn't go we have a better day. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8595.74s)]
*  But it just so happens that it landed on the same day as Easter and they're like fuck we gotta. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8597.58s)]
*  Right. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8602.699999999999s)]
*  I had Twitter accounts going this is wrong. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8605.26s)]
*  Just flat out what what Andrew is saying here is wrong. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8608.859999999999s)]
*  No explanation or anything. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8612.539999999999s)]
*  And it's not wrong. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8613.82s)]
*  It's actually right. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8614.539999999999s)]
*  The date was decided 15 years ago. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8616.22s)]
*  They acknowledged it what seven years ago or so maybe it was three or whatever the fuck it was. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8617.9s)]
*  But still bro I talked to a dude about political bias and how it fucks up your understanding [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8622.06s)]
*  and your ability to literally do like measurable mathematics. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8626.460000000001s)]
*  If you give people two math equations. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8629.82s)]
*  Yeah this guy was a researcher at NYU psychologist that literally did the experiment. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8631.66s)]
*  You give people two math equations. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8635.26s)]
*  Okay one math equation basically is like hey does this skin cream you know is it [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8636.460000000001s)]
*  beneficial for controlling this rash that people have. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8641.66s)]
*  And here's the data set and here's the sample and tell us if it's conclusive or not. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8643.9s)]
*  People when they had the math equation were able to solve it with like 99 percent accuracy. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8647.66s)]
*  Wow. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8651.82s)]
*  And then when they gave them an equation that said hey gun control in this place these are [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8652.22s)]
*  the stats when you have gun control here's what happens with gun control here's the data do an [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8656.94s)]
*  equation and they gave some people stat data where the gun control benefited like their position that [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8660.859999999999s)]
*  like gun control was good and then other people gave them gun control was bad and depending on [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8666.859999999999s)]
*  what their political leaning was they weren't able to do the math equation. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8671.9s)]
*  Bro that's. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8675.5s)]
*  Or at the very least it took like three times as long for the average person to do the math equation. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8675.9s)]
*  One I completely believe it. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8680.22s)]
*  Two I also think there are people that can do the math equation but know where their [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8681.42s)]
*  bread is buttered and they refuse to deviate from where their bread is buttered. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8684.779999999999s)]
*  Also if there's anybody deviating from where their bread is buttered [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8689.74s)]
*  they will do everything they can to dismiss or discredit that point of view. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8693.42s)]
*  It's like when a daily show sends their correspondence to like a rally [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8698.38s)]
*  and then they're like asking them about like policies and stuff like that and then they're [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8702.22s)]
*  saying things that would it would force the person to have to go against. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8705.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8710.22s)]
*  They're like I don't know. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8710.38s)]
*  All of a sudden they don't want to talk. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8712.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8714.38s)]
*  It's so great. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8714.699999999999s)]
*  But like if you if you were given given data it's like [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPOXVTxmDg&t=8715.5s)]
