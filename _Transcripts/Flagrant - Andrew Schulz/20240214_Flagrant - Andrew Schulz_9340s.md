*  So it was like a beautiful gift but we went there and I gotta get the image [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=33.04s)]
*  I don't know if it was her face was like pushed up against [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=38.76s)]
*  her nose was [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=43.36s)]
*  Huge it was it to the point where we were like alright. Well we can do something about it [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=45.76s)]
*  Like for like weeks I was like and I asked the technician who did it [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=52.68000000000001s)]
*  It was [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  It was it was like half the size for five point five it might have been bro [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=65.44s)]
*  It had to be something you're blaming yourself cross on blame on myself Emma's nose is tiny little button nose [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=69.24000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, this big nose taking half the kids and I asked the technician and I go hey this sounds horrible [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=74.34s)]
*  I know I sound like horrible father when I asked the technician I was like yeah, but it's just in there [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=80.72s)]
*  It will probably change and the technician looks at me and Emma goes you know what my daughter looks exactly [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=84.84s)]
*  So yeah, it was it was absolutely crazy and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=102.4s)]
*  But yeah here we are man. What's it like first time put the baby on your chest? What are you thinking? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=105.28s)]
*  Alright, so labor was crazy Emma water breaks water break is not like the movie. I thought it was splash [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=109.76s)]
*  It's not splash. She thought she peed herself a little she was unsure [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=116.04s)]
*  I had paddle booked the next day that I was mad excited about and you didn't cancel that's a way too late [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=120.08000000000001s)]
*  It might be a pee we're on the way to the hospital [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=130.24s)]
*  I'm not sure might be a piece though. They might tell us to go home, and I got paddle lock [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=132.24s)]
*  I didn't cancel paddle to the last minute [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=135.84s)]
*  We go [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=139.79999999999998s)]
*  We fight we we it's a natural birth. It's gonna take hours. I can go sneak it out into a paddle [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=141.39999999999998s)]
*  So I was thinking that but then here's the thing [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=146.39999999999998s)]
*  Here's the thing that the so every week before that the gynecologist fingers my wife in front of me right because they got to see [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=149.88s)]
*  If the it's she's dilated at all the uterus is dilated the cervix cervix is dilated right so just fingers my wife right in front [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=157.2s)]
*  Of me no big fucking deal shout out to dr. Gubala great job [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=164.16s)]
*  Never moaned once [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=167.8s)]
*  Come holler at me if you want to learn something [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=170.12s)]
*  Exactly you don't know how to finger [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=174.16s)]
*  Boy, you know mechanical about it right gloves and shit on you need lube [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=176.52s)]
*  Saliva never try that doc anyway, so [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=183.72s)]
*  She wasn't dilated literally we have a doctor point next day that night [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=188.4s)]
*  We're about to get in bed gets out of bed [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=193.16s)]
*  Oh [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=194.84s)]
*  I should think she peed herself a little bit goes to the bathroom more peas kind of come out peas [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=195.0s)]
*  Then stands up a little bit more peas coming out, and she's like oh shit. Is this it then you get hyped [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=199.56s)]
*  Fuck then you're I'm high here in that right you're like. Oh my god. It's about to happen like this is great [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=205.07999999999998s)]
*  It's like the movies are water breaking, but it's little trickles [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=209.4s)]
*  You're not exactly sure we clean it up, and there's like a little like pink in it [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=211.4s)]
*  We were calling Alicia Mark's wife is a midwife, so she knows like everything about it [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=215.35999999999999s)]
*  She'd like work with my wife about like how she wants the birth to go my wife had this whole birth [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=219.0s)]
*  Plan I got the birth plan memorized. I got it written down. I'm fucking ready to go okay [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=223.12s)]
*  My wife is like I want to do it natural women. It's a big thing for them to do it natural which is dumb [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=227.32s)]
*  But they care about it. Yeah, I mean it. Yeah, I have no reason why like I think it [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=232.72s)]
*  They make they feel like more of a mom or a woman or whatever is nonsense, but yeah [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=237.3s)]
*  So she wants to do it natural she didn't want to take this thing called pitocin pitocin is is used to get women to [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=244.96s)]
*  Have contractions be more like regulated and then start to really dilate [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=251.72s)]
*  Sir Vex right so you can get it ready needs to be a 10 centimeters for the baby to come out [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=256.4s)]
*  So she didn't want to do that she wants to do a natural center, so this is her birth plan [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=259.86s)]
*  She's fucking ready to go [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=263.26s)]
*  Water breaks second water breaks you got to go to the hospital bees there's a risk of infection [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=265.52s)]
*  So you can't like what's called labor at home like go through the beginning of the contractions just at home [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=269.6s)]
*  So we go to the hospital on the way to the hospital ready hyped how'd you get you drive? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=274.48s)]
*  I'm wondering [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=278.8s)]
*  Over black over black [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=282.32s)]
*  I took over black to battle [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=306.56s)]
*  I [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=308.8s)]
*  Got to get there. I need to stretch out because my knees are tight [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=310.8s)]
*  If I don't set my legs out and uber on the way I'm gonna have to jump on my paddle lesson [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=312.8s)]
*  Shit fucking my paddle lesson [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=316.8s)]
*  Right into the car holding it like this [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=318.8s)]
*  She probably wants a smaller car [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=320.8s)]
*  No no no no we probably did uber excel or some shit like that [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=322.8s)]
*  Anyway so we get to the hospital [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=328.8s)]
*  Admit it to the hospital go in this little triage room or whatever like that they call it [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=331.8s)]
*  They just kind of you know figure all the things out contractions start a little bit you hear about these contractions you're hyped you know [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=336.36s)]
*  We did all these like lessons to learn about we're like okay. We're looking for 4-1-1 [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=342.76s)]
*  Okay, every four minutes for one minute for an hour. That's how we know something's good [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=346.68s)]
*  I don't know what it was, but I remember 4-1-1 so that's what I'm like. I'm timing out these fucking contractions. It's fucking great [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=352.08000000000004s)]
*  It's exciting go into another room [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=357.6s)]
*  She's not dilated yet, right? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=360.72s)]
*  They're like oh, I think we should put you on pitocin that thing she didn't want to take so we can get you a dilate [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=362.68s)]
*  She's like all right, so first thing I didn't want to do but fine [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=367.28000000000003s)]
*  We'll do the pitocin problem with the pitocin starts those contractions contractions get really bad, okay, okay? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=369.16s)]
*  Up the pitocin up they start at like 10 [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=375.44s)]
*  20 hours later we're at 30 [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=379.48s)]
*  Epidural 20 oh no she was it she was in she was in labor for 24 hours fucking on 24 hours [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=382.4s)]
*  Baby's heartbeat starts to drop. Oh fuck now keep in mind [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=388.88s)]
*  I haven't told anybody anybody who's come out to the live show knows [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=392.68s)]
*  But it was really difficult for him and I to get pregnant you guys knew about it [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=395.0s)]
*  We didn't I didn't talk about publicly I've said it at the stand-up shows for some reason I felt more comfortable doing that [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=398.6s)]
*  It's it's really what the hour is is about but it's really fucking hard for us to get pregnant and the entire time [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=404.24s)]
*  You're just like thinking that [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=411.04s)]
*  It's not gonna work out so basically for like almost two years [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=413.16s)]
*  I'm just like this is something's gonna happen because everything that did go wrong went wrong for us and [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=416.08s)]

*  When they sleep, it's the cutest thing you've ever seen. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1553.12s)]
*  When they cry, it's adorable. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1555.12s)]
*  When they burp, it's the funniest thing. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1557.12s)]
*  Everything about them is the most that you've ever seen. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1559.12s)]
*  Everything about them is the most that you've ever experienced. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1561.12s)]
*  When they throw up, everyone dies laughing. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1563.12s)]
*  When they fart, it's the funniest thing. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1565.12s)]
*  When they fart, it's the funniest thing. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1567.12s)]
*  I remember when Luther educated, he took a shit and he was like, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1569.12s)]
*  You want to come see this? This is funny. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1571.12s)]
*  It's the coolest shit. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1573.12s)]
*  When they first shit, it's dark. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1575.12s)]
*  It's a dark shit. It's an onyx. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1577.12s)]
*  It's a dark onyx. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1579.12s)]
*  It's the darkest shit you've ever seen in your life. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1581.12s)]
*  And then it starts to lighten up. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1583.12s)]
*  That first one, they've been plotting on it for a while. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1585.12s)]
*  That's a long month cooker right there. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1587.12s)]
*  When she pees, her nostrils flare. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1589.12s)]
*  She farts just like me, constantly farting. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1591.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's fire. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1595.12s)]
*  Did she imitate it too? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1597.12s)]
*  No, but I did. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1599.12s)]
*  In about two months, you're going to just lift one cheek and fart. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1601.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's fire. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1603.12s)]
*  How was it when your parents came? [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1605.12s)]
*  The thing about babies is they literally bring out the best version of everybody. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1607.12s)]
*  As long as they're not crying on a plane or something like that. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1611.12s)]
*  Even then, I find it cute. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1615.12s)]
*  Because you're a fucking good human. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1617.12s)]
*  Fucking asshole over here. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1623.12s)]
*  Take a bus, bro. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1625.12s)]
*  Anybody that sees a baby, they're on their best behavior. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1629.12s)]
*  They're their kindness, they're their sweetest, they treat you the best. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1633.12s)]
*  All of a sudden, you're qualified as not an asshole. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1635.12s)]
*  You could be an asshole. You could be a horrible parent. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1639.12s)]
*  But when you see somebody pushing a baby, you're like, alright, they're probably not... [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1641.12s)]
*  Decent. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1645.12s)]
*  They're probably a decent human being. They're taking care of a thing. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1647.12s)]
*  And seeing my mom weep, my mom's a tough Scottish woman. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1649.12s)]
*  I've never seen her... [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1653.12s)]
*  Immediately, weep. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1655.12s)]
*  Adorable. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1657.12s)]
*  Dad is clocked out. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1661.12s)]
*  Dad multiple times just on the couch like, who is that? [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1665.12s)]
*  Who is that? [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1669.12s)]
*  That's your granddaughter. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1673.12s)]
*  That's sort of cool. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1675.12s)]
*  You should tell her to come out to Fire Island. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1677.12s)]
*  Multiple invites. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1679.12s)]
*  That's reasonable, she just got here though. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1681.12s)]
*  She just got here. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1683.12s)]
*  100%. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1685.12s)]
*  I mean, yeah, it's just... [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1687.12s)]
*  No, but imagine getting that news multiple times. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1689.12s)]
*  That's the best day of your life. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1691.12s)]
*  Every minute, that's fucking awesome. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1693.12s)]
*  You're a granddad immediately, over and over again. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1695.12s)]
*  Also, anytime you share that you have a kid with people who have kids, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1697.12s)]
*  they get to relive the best moments of their kid's early childhood. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1701.12s)]
*  So their eyes light up and they tell you about when their kid was just born [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1707.12s)]
*  and how magical it was, and when their grandkid... [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1711.12s)]
*  Yeah, it was fucking awesome. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1713.12s)]
*  Do you get the picture stereotype now? [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1715.12s)]
*  Every new parent's like, oh yeah, look. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1717.12s)]
*  Oh, I find myself doing it. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1719.12s)]
*  And I know when I'm sharing with people, they don't give a fuck, and I still do it. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1721.12s)]
*  I get a fuck. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1725.12s)]
*  With you guys, you guys care. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1727.12s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1729.12s)]
*  I know the average person doesn't, but I will still... [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1731.12s)]
*  And you should. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1733.12s)]
*  You're most proud of creating that over anything else in your life. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1735.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1739.12s)]
*  Your mom's seen the scan of you, she's like, is the nose gonna be that way? [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1741.12s)]
*  She was worried. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1745.12s)]
*  She was worried. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1747.12s)]
*  It's also weird when you look at them, you see... [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1749.12s)]
*  I saw my mom immediately. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1751.12s)]
*  It was creepy. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1753.12s)]
*  And I wonder if it's a biological trick that you're supposed to see either yourself [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1755.12s)]
*  or your relatives in your kid so you don't assume that your wife's a bitch. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1759.12s)]
*  And then, because I would be a bitch if she got... [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1765.12s)]
*  That'd be a mean thing to do. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1767.12s)]
*  It's a cruel joke. It's a prank. It's a mean prank. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1769.12s)]
*  It is a fucking mean prank. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1771.12s)]
*  Super rude. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1773.12s)]
*  But yeah, I don't know. I feel like I'm rambling at this point. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1775.12s)]
*  No, dude. It's great. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1777.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's just crazy. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1779.12s)]
*  First one to have a kid. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1781.12s)]
*  Jason Cuts. I tell you guys this. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1783.12s)]
*  He goes, yeah, you gotta hide the diapers. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1785.12s)]
*  I go, why? [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1787.12s)]
*  He goes, well, you hide the diapers. And then your wife's like, we ran out of diapers. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1789.12s)]
*  And you go, well, I'll go get some. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1791.12s)]
*  That's good. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1795.12s)]
*  Free game. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1797.12s)]
*  I hit a bouillette. He's like, oh, dude. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1799.12s)]
*  He goes, well, my baby mama, she liked this specific thing from Starbucks. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1801.12s)]
*  He goes, those are the two best parts of my day. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1805.12s)]
*  I go get her Starbucks in the morning. I get her Starbucks in the afternoon. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1807.12s)]
*  And I love those are the moments. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1809.12s)]
*  And you're basically finding these moments to be of service. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1811.12s)]
*  But get the fuck out the house as well. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1813.12s)]
*  Because while the baby's sleeping, you can't play with it. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1815.12s)]
*  You can stare at it for so long. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1817.12s)]
*  It's impossible to stare at without giving it a kiss. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1819.12s)]
*  It's impossible. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1821.12s)]
*  It is impossible. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1823.12s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1825.12s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1827.12s)]
*  Also, you're not supposed to sleep with them on your body. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1829.12s)]
*  Nothing makes you want to go to sleep. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1831.12s)]
*  When they're asleep, you're supposed to be sleeping. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1833.12s)]
*  You're supposed to be sleeping. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1835.12s)]
*  When they're asleep. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1837.12s)]
*  It's like a little weighted blanket. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1839.12s)]
*  TV's on. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1841.12s)]
*  The heat comes on in the apartment. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1843.12s)]
*  Also, they don't bitch about anything. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1845.12s)]
*  You can have full level conversations. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1847.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1849.12s)]
*  Babies don't care when you're scrolling. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1851.12s)]
*  They love it. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1853.12s)]
*  I will say this though. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1855.12s)]
*  They're right. My wife is right. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1857.12s)]
*  Women who just give birth and are doing all the things are right in this. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1859.12s)]
*  But [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1861.12s)]
*  They don't realize they need something. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1863.12s)]
*  They need something. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1865.12s)]
*  Until you sit down and exhale. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1867.12s)]
*  At the moment of sit down and exhale [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1871.12s)]
*  is their brains go, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1873.12s)]
*  Oh, can I have the weight distributed in the apartment a little bit more with you over there? [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1875.12s)]
*  The second you sit down. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1881.12s)]
*  It makes complete sense. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1883.12s)]
*  I'm doing everything. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1885.12s)]
*  This motherfucker exhales. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1887.12s)]
*  You ain't do shit first of all. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1889.12s)]
*  You had a 24 hour labor. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1891.12s)]
*  You can't have coffee. Talk to me. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1893.12s)]
*  It was like day four. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1895.12s)]
*  We were in the hospital for a while. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1897.12s)]
*  Day four I'm fucking exhausted. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1899.12s)]
*  I'm going downstairs in El Derri to get a coffee. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1901.12s)]
*  I remember thinking to myself, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1903.12s)]
*  Oh, this is going out for some cigarettes. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1905.12s)]
*  I would never. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1913.12s)]
*  But this is when it happens. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1915.12s)]
*  It's this time. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1919.12s)]
*  The truce of the sock gets in there. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1921.12s)]
*  I'm all by myself. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1923.12s)]
*  Nobody would even know. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1925.12s)]
*  I'm just going to get off on the second floor [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1927.12s)]
*  and then go get some Starbucks. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1929.12s)]
*  That's what I would do. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1931.12s)]
*  I love my kid more than anything in the world. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1933.12s)]
*  It's amazing. I love my wife more than anything in the world. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1935.12s)]
*  But someone who didn't would take this feeling [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1937.12s)]
*  and they would go get some cigarettes. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1939.12s)]
*  And then you'd never see them unless you made the NBA. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1941.12s)]
*  That would be the only time. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1943.12s)]
*  You just look at the car keys. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1945.12s)]
*  Bro, I'm telling you. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1947.12s)]
*  Not even the car keys. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1949.12s)]
*  Uber app. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1951.12s)]
*  He's getting some over black. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1953.12s)]
*  I'm like dead. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1955.12s)]
*  I need some comfort. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1957.12s)]
*  Anyway, listen. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1959.12s)]
*  So yeah, anyway. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1961.12s)]
*  Thank you guys. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1963.12s)]
*  Everybody who came out to. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1965.12s)]
*  There's a lot of people that came out to Life Tour, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1967.12s)]
*  which is really about the whole process. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1969.12s)]
*  Why it's called the Life Tour. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1971.12s)]
*  But about trying to get pregnant. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1973.12s)]
*  And a lot of people would DM me afterwards. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1975.12s)]
*  And they would like wish us best luck. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1977.12s)]
*  And they would like pray for us. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1979.12s)]
*  Which was, you know, I'm not a very religious guy. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1981.12s)]
*  But for whatever reason, it really means a lot [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1983.12s)]
*  when people who are religious offer to pray. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1985.12s)]
*  And we really needed everything. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1987.12s)]
*  All the help that we could have gotten. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1989.12s)]
*  That meant a lot. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1991.12s)]
*  So I just want to say thank you to everybody who came out. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1993.12s)]
*  Everybody's been supportive through that process. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1995.12s)]
*  And also people who kind of kept this a secret. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1997.12s)]
*  I know it seems weird to talk about it on stage. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=1999.12s)]
*  But also not really wanted to be out there. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2001.12s)]
*  I think we discussed it on the call. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2003.12s)]
*  Someone brought up a good point. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2005.12s)]
*  Which is like you were talking about something that you had gone through. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2007.12s)]
*  But you hadn't had the baby yet. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2009.12s)]
*  And you already said everything that could have gone wrong has gone wrong. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2011.12s)]
*  And I would be like, I don't want to jinx anything. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2013.12s)]
*  I was so terrified of jinxing it. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2015.12s)]
*  But even on stage, we had an agreement. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2017.12s)]
*  My wife and I, we wouldn't talk about getting pregnant. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2019.12s)]
*  Until the baby could survive premature birth. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2021.12s)]
*  So I think after maybe six months or something like that. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2027.12s)]
*  So I didn't confirm on stage up until then that she actually got pregnant. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2029.12s)]
*  It was like, okay, we're trying. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2031.12s)]
*  And hopefully everything will go well throughout this process. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2033.12s)]
*  So we were just so fucking scared. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2035.12s)]
*  You get superstitious. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2037.12s)]
*  The miracle of childbirth. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2039.12s)]
*  As you get older, you realize that it is a fucking miracle. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2041.12s)]
*  Like so many things can happen. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2043.12s)]
*  Bro, you know what happened? [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2045.12s)]
*  This is the miracle of childbirth. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2047.12s)]
*  I'm so happy. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2049.12s)]
*  I'm so happy. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2051.12s)]
*  I'm so happy. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2053.12s)]
*  I'm so happy. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2055.12s)]
*  Bro, you know what happened? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2057.12s)]
*  I became a feminist and an anti-vaxxer day one. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2059.12s)]
*  Day one. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2063.12s)]
*  That's an interesting comment. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2065.12s)]
*  I became an anti-vaxxer day one. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2067.12s)]
*  Why? [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2069.12s)]
*  They come into the room. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2071.12s)]
*  They're like, hey, would you like, we'd like to give the baby the hepatitis B shot. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2073.12s)]
*  And I go, whoa, whoa, whoa. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2075.12s)]
*  Who did that for? Who is he fucking? [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2077.12s)]
*  So I didn't know that. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2079.12s)]
*  Literally, I didn't know that. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2081.12s)]
*  So I go, hepatitis B. I'm like, what's hepatitis B? [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2083.12s)]
*  I'm like, well, how do you get hepatitis B? [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2085.12s)]
*  And then they're like, oh, well, it's a sexually transmitted disease. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2087.12s)]
*  And I'm like, see what I mean? [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2089.12s)]
*  Suck my dick. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2091.12s)]
*  Don't give me hepatitis B. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2093.12s)]
*  You gotta get the full cocktail. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2095.12s)]
*  You gotta get everything. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2097.12s)]
*  I'm not saying you don't. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2099.12s)]
*  What I'm trying to say is we don't need that. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2101.12s)]
*  Like what's happening in the nursery that like you're worried about this baby getting hepatitis? [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2103.12s)]
*  We can leave that one off the list. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2105.12s)]
*  I'm not even saying leave it off. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2107.12s)]
*  Like we just made a baby. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2109.12s)]
*  Day one? [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2111.12s)]
*  You're gonna give her a vaccine for some shit that it would be hopefully really hard for her to get. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2113.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of a diss, dude. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2119.12s)]
*  Because they give it if like either the parents have hepatitis B. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2121.12s)]
*  And so they're basically being like, yo, just to be safe. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2123.12s)]
*  What are you saying about me? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2125.12s)]
*  Do I look like I have fucking hepatitis? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2127.12s)]
*  At least I understand the rationalities. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2129.12s)]
*  But it's like, could you ask if I have it? [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2131.12s)]
*  Let's just figure out if I have it. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2133.12s)]
*  And then, no, thank you on that one. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2135.12s)]
*  It should be like dim sum. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2137.12s)]
*  I check all the ones I want. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2139.12s)]
*  Yeah, and if we don't want it, we don't want it. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2141.12s)]
*  Exactly. That's a great, yes. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2143.12s)]
*  Dim sum with the vaccine. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2145.12s)]
*  And I'll be honest, some shit is changing about vaccines now. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2147.12s)]
*  What's changing? [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2149.12s)]
*  And this is the, it's like parents don't want to admit that they're skeptical. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2153.12s)]
*  Because Emma started to research some shit. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2157.12s)]
*  She was like, it's not the vaccine, but like, she's like the chances of her getting hepatitis are like one in a million. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2159.12s)]
*  Day one. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2163.12s)]
*  She is, the chances of her having negative effects [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2165.12s)]
*  based on the aluminum that's in the vaccine are like one in 1300. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2169.12s)]
*  So it's like, you have a one in a million, I'll go with one in a million odds over one in 1300 odds. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2175.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2181.12s)]
*  In the beginning, and eventually when the baby's built up a little bit more, you can handle it. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2183.12s)]
*  But I see why there is a skepticism around the vaccines when they're like coming around day one to shoot up your baby. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2187.12s)]
*  And there's really no upside. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2193.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2195.12s)]
*  Or at least ask me if I got the help like you said. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2197.12s)]
*  Yeah, again, I think it's, dude, being completely anti-vaxxers crazy, but also every vaccine I need to give them that I believe that. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2199.12s)]
*  We went to, we went to this pediatrician because you got to schedule the, do your appointment and all that kind of shit. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2207.12s)]
*  It's a really beautiful mom. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2211.12s)]
*  And then we're like, yeah, so we're wondering about the vaccines. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2213.12s)]
*  And the pediatrician goes, she's like, we're wondering like the timing of that. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2215.12s)]
*  She's like, yeah, do you want to space them out a little bit? [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2217.12s)]
*  They suggested it. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2221.12s)]
*  That means, you know how many parents got to be in there asking for it to be spaced out for even the doctor to go and. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2223.12s)]
*  To preemptively. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2229.12s)]
*  Exactly, and we're not talking about like some like goofy off the res Appalachian mountain conspiracy kooks. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2231.12s)]
*  We're talking about some fucking finance bro parents going, what exactly? [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2237.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2243.12s)]
*  Now I'm not saying we should be skeptical about all the vaccines. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2245.12s)]
*  You just see why it exists. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2247.12s)]
*  Is that fair? [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2249.12s)]

*  That was pretty awesome. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2291.12s)]
*  Thank you guys for being so supportive throughout this whole process. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2293.12s)]
*  I know that there's been times that have been like high stress that I've definitely come into the pod. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2295.12s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2299.12s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2301.12s)]
*  So I developed a breathing issue. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2303.12s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2305.12s)]
*  He said, that's what I thought of when he goes, this is the first time I could breathe. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2307.12s)]
*  Do you guys remember on Patreon, he was like, I just can't take like a deep breath. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2309.12s)]
*  I haven't been able to do it for months. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2311.12s)]
*  I need a nose surgery. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2313.12s)]
*  You need to have a baby. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2315.12s)]
*  I was so, like I thought about this the other day. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2317.12s)]
*  Like imagine having my size nose and not getting enough air. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2319.12s)]
*  I have none of the benefits. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2321.12s)]
*  I should have excess air. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2323.12s)]
*  At all points in time. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2325.12s)]
*  I should be lighter than I am. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2327.12s)]
*  You could be an air donor. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2329.12s)]
*  Yes. If there was one of those, I should have that. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2331.12s)]
*  The fact that like, but yeah, I looked it up and there's like this stressed induced [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2333.12s)]
*  It's not asthma. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2335.12s)]
*  It's like hyperventilation. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2337.12s)]
*  And like, yeah, I was just like, I would have. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2339.12s)]
*  And then all brilliant idiots would happen. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2341.12s)]
*  Sometimes it happened. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2343.12s)]
*  I would be yawning a lot and people thought I was tired. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2345.12s)]
*  But it was a symptom of not having enough oxygen. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2347.12s)]
*  So your body takes over and just induces a yawn so you can get enough. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2349.12s)]
*  So your body takes over and just induces a yawn so you can get enough. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2351.12s)]
*  So your body takes over and just induces a yawn so you can get enough. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2353.12s)]
*  Yawning is an anxiety thing. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2355.12s)]
*  I do it all the time when I'm anxious. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2357.12s)]
*  Yo, it was fucking crazy. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2359.12s)]
*  Stress is crazy what it can do to your body. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2361.12s)]
*  It was like, I think one of you guys was saying this. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2363.12s)]
*  It was like, your body eventually, what is it? [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2365.12s)]
*  It was like, one of you guys was saying this. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2367.12s)]
*  It was like, your body eventually, what is it? [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2369.12s)]
*  There's a book called Healing Back Pain. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2371.12s)]
*  Basically the idea is like a lot of times your body creates pain or physical, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2373.12s)]
*  physiological issues to distract your mind from like the overwhelming stress and anxieties. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2375.12s)]
*  to distract your mind from like the overwhelming stress and anxieties. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2377.12s)]
*  to distract your mind from like the overwhelming stress and anxieties. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2379.12s)]
*  Like look, you're not trying to deal with that right now, but I get it. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2381.12s)]
*  So let's just have some other shit pop up. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2383.12s)]
*  You can focus on that. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2385.12s)]
*  And that's kind of the idea. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2387.12s)]
*  My wife had migraines, not to talk about this, like every day for like months. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2389.12s)]
*  You guys knew that. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2391.12s)]
*  And then we kind of dug and she was going through a lot and it was a lot of stress stuff. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2393.12s)]
*  And then once she started to understand that, the migraines had mostly gone away. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2395.12s)]
*  And then once she started to understand that, the migraines had mostly gone away. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2397.12s)]
*  Every day for months she had migraines. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2399.12s)]
*  Debilitating migraines. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2401.12s)]
*  Similar thing. It's just stress can have an insane impact on the body. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2403.12s)]
*  I never believed in that shit. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2405.12s)]
*  I thought that shit was gay. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2407.12s)]
*  Like my whole life, I'm like, what do you mean it's stressed out? [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2409.12s)]
*  It's still gonna be gay. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2411.12s)]
*  It's probably. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2413.12s)]
*  That's why you were yawning, just trying to suck somebody's dick. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2415.12s)]
*  And it did in his mouth. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2417.12s)]
*  That's a greatizers example for disprovisation. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2419.12s)]
*  I mean basically, it's like, I just couldn't think of an example. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2421.12s)]
*  I like to draw more attention to the brain. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2423.12s)]
*  And he's like, let me explain. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2425.12s)]
*  But that's a lot of words that I couldn't put. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2427.12s)]
*  We just went a little bit too far. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2431.12s)]
*  I'm like, what's the point in writing it? [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2433.12s)]
*  Well the other thing Polish, no Schropir, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2435.12s)]
*  I read about it. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2437.12s)]
*  No Schropir for a long time. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2439.12s)]
*  So, but yeah, low key, like I just couldn't get full breath severe. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2441.12s)]
*  It's the weirdest, it is the weirdest thing to explain. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2445.12s)]
*  survival mode, or like this hyper focus, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2448.12s)]
*  and you can't be stressed by these other things. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2451.2s)]
*  But I remember I'd be doing shows at The Cellar, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2454.0s)]
*  and then in between I would have to leave, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2455.8399999999997s)]
*  and I would go to this little park off Sixth Avenue, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2457.64s)]
*  where they had these benches, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2460.2799999999997s)]
*  and I would do these box breathing techniques [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2461.64s)]
*  that they give like Navy Seals and shit, [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2464.2s)]
*  where it's like a six second breath in, hold, exhale. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2466.3199999999997s)]
*  12 second exhale or whatever. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2471.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, six second, and then you just keep doing it, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2472.4s)]
*  and I'm like, anything I could do [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2474.56s)]
*  to find a way to be able to breathe. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2477.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2479.76s)]
*  And it was just crazy. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2480.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it sucks. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2482.08s)]
*  And that was for over a year, it's just like. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2482.92s)]
*  Yeah, you're in a little bit of denial about the stress, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2484.2400000000002s)]
*  I think, because I'm a rest. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2485.8s)]
*  Huge. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2486.92s)]
*  You're like, are you stressed? [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2487.76s)]
*  You're like, nah, I'm not stressed. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2488.58s)]
*  And then you'd be like, hang on one second, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2489.48s)]
*  my girl's calling me. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2490.36s)]

*  No, not at all. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2538.28s)]
*  Not at all fun. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2539.92s)]
*  Hasn't changed your relationship with nothing to do. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2541.0s)]
*  I felt like I was, yeah, no, I need things to do. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2543.2000000000003s)]

*  Like, what? [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2547.04s)]
*  Do you want a pump? [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2547.88s)]
*  Put it in the bottle? [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2549.48s)]
*  I think that's illegal. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2550.32s)]
*  You know, the baby tried to latch on me. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2551.1600000000003s)]
*  When the baby first came out, I had to be like, [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2553.04s)]
*  yo, it curved my own daughter. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2554.64s)]
*  That's a diss, that's a diss. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2556.52s)]
*  Real talk, I got some titties out. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2558.36s)]
*  Damn, bro. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2560.64s)]

*  I wanna keep my brain. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2565.0s)]
*  Yo, the idea of like, yeah, whatever. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2566.32s)]
*  Was it the opposite? [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2569.28s)]
*  Were you like, yo, I wanna get after it more? [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2570.12s)]
*  Like, I got something to fight for now? [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2571.76s)]
*  No, like everybody said that too. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2573.68s)]
*  They're like, yo, the second this baby happens, [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2575.36s)]
*  you're gonna wanna go out there and work so hard. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2577.0s)]
*  I'm like, I wanna retire. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2578.96s)]
*  I wanna hang out with this baby all the fucking time. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2580.8s)]
*  Play paddle and hang with my kids? [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2582.64s)]
*  That's the best day ever. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2583.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, but yeah. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2586.64s)]
*  But in terms of like, yeah, I wanna do things. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2589.44s)]
*  I wanna, I like, I love that my wife [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2592.44s)]
*  has the ultimate purpose right now. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2595.2400000000002s)]
*  It's incredible, like she's literally [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2597.4s)]
*  giving life to something. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2600.2000000000003s)]
*  And I think that the dad really comes into play [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2601.84s)]
*  a little bit later, as I've talked to some of my friends. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2608.6s)]
*  They're like, yeah, once they start kind of waking up [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2610.96s)]
*  and recognizing you, then you're like [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2612.7200000000003s)]
*  teaching them things, showing them things, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2614.2400000000002s)]
*  walking with them, like, [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2615.88s)]
*  playing with everything that you do with them, [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2617.44s)]
*  they're just absorbing and taking in. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2619.4s)]
*  But right now, you're in the stage of like, [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2621.2000000000003s)]
*  keep this baby alive, fed, and growing. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2623.4s)]
*  And I'm trying to do everything I can to make that happen. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2627.4s)]
*  But paternity leave is ridiculous, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2631.4s)]
*  is basically what I'm trying to say. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2633.48s)]
*  Like whatever fucking idiot invented that. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2635.0s)]
*  Paternity leave? [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2637.08s)]
*  Like, for what? [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2638.6800000000003s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2641.6800000000003s)]
*  Like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2643.48s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2646.84s)]
*  Maternity leave is like, it should be criminal [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2647.6800000000003s)]
*  if you don't automatically. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2650.84s)]
*  How long should it be? [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2652.12s)]
*  Because it's like six weeks in the US. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2653.08s)]
*  For the rest of their life. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2653.92s)]
*  Once a woman gives birth, [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2655.52s)]
*  she should never have to go back to it. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2656.56s)]
*  I do believe it's beneath them. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2658.48s)]
*  I think I've said that before, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2659.7200000000003s)]
*  but I think it's beneath a woman to go back. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2660.92s)]
*  If it's her passion or whatever, do it, but like. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2662.7200000000003s)]
*  If it's just like a job working at like Target [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2667.88s)]
*  or something like that, it's beneath you once you give birth. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2670.84s)]
*  So you just take two jobs? [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2672.6800000000003s)]
*  Or the government should supply it. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2673.92s)]
*  Do we want a country or not? [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2676.56s)]
*  Socialist, I'm a socialist. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2677.3999999999996s)]
*  I'm a feminist, a socialist, an anti-vaxxer. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2680.3999999999996s)]
*  We need a larger managerial class. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2683.3199999999997s)]
*  Sorry Vivek, you don't know what's going on. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2685.0s)]
*  But yeah, it's beneath them. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2687.24s)]
*  They created a human being. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2688.8799999999997s)]
*  You're gonna go work the register now? [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2690.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, they call it leave, like, oh, you're gonna come back. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2692.56s)]
*  It should be maternity start. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2695.12s)]
*  Start. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2696.68s)]
*  Maternity beginning. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2697.52s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2698.3599999999997s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2699.2s)]
*  Six months in Europe. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2701.3599999999997s)]
*  For a woman. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2703.3999999999996s)]
*  I thought it was like a year, right? [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2704.68s)]
*  Some go up even to a year, that's great. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2706.3199999999997s)]
*  But the paternity leave, whatever man argued for that, [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2708.48s)]
*  they then got it and they were like, bad idea. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2710.92s)]
*  What about the podcast last week? [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2714.3199999999997s)]
*  What'd I say? [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2715.48s)]
*  You said, hey, I'm not gonna do the podcast. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2716.3199999999997s)]
*  That's my wife. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2719.2s)]
*  I'm like. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2720.04s)]
*  Come on, bro. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2720.8799999999997s)]
*  You kidding me? [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2722.68s)]
*  I would've gone out to get some diapers in a Harpy. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2724.08s)]
*  She saw you on an Instagram clip. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2727.3599999999997s)]
*  When did you record this? [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2730.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it was all, we banked. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2732.44s)]
*  Schedule, schedule, schedule. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2733.52s)]
*  Yeah, we banked it way longer. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2734.36s)]
*  No, I think paternity leave should be a week. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2735.48s)]
*  You need a week so that they can mend up [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2737.36s)]
*  and everything is gonna be okay. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2739.04s)]
*  As long as the wife has help. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2740.52s)]
*  If the wife has family, if you have a baby nurse, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2742.0s)]
*  the wife needs help. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2744.72s)]
*  You need something for the wife, 100%. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2745.56s)]
*  But if I'm being home, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2747.68s)]
*  because I selfishly wanna be around my kid. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2749.56s)]
*  Like I just wanna be near her every second of the day. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2752.08s)]
*  I want that, selfish. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2755.04s)]
*  If my wife was smart, she would say, [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2757.0s)]
*  hey, you're useless right now. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2759.24s)]
*  Go make us as much money as you possibly can [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2762.12s)]
*  so that she's safe and we're safe during this time period. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2765.16s)]
*  Let's have you say that sentence again [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2769.12s)]
*  so we can keep it, but just don't say if my wife was smart. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2770.68s)]
*  Let me just save you a fucking fight. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2773.12s)]
*  All right. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2774.92s)]

*  How do I say this? [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2784.24s)]
*  The ideal setup, the ideal setup. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2786.2799999999997s)]
*  If my wife was even more genius than she is. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2788.4s)]

*  She's already obviously a genius. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2791.6s)]
*  Of course. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2793.16s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2794.0s)]
*  No big deal. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2794.84s)]
*  NBA from NYU. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2795.68s)]

*  You know what I mean? [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2800.36s)]
*  So if she wanted to treat this like a business, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2801.32s)]
*  she would say, yo, during this time period [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2803.52s)]
*  where you're a servant, go out there and get after it [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2805.48s)]

*  The general. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2914.2000000000003s)]

*  Anyway, okay, I'm sure we got other things to talk about. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2918.6800000000003s)]
*  But thank you guys one more time. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2921.76s)]
*  This is how I should have known he needed things to do [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2922.6000000000004s)]
*  is when he started texting about the Super Bowl, [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2924.44s)]
*  I was like, this motherfucker needs things to do. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2926.4s)]
*  When he's watching the Super Bowl fixated on football, [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2929.0s)]
*  this guy's bored out of his mind. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2933.4s)]
*  That game was incredible. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2934.84s)]
*  That game was incredible. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2936.04s)]
*  It was a good game. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2936.8799999999997s)]
*  The best, one of the best games I've ever seen. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2937.72s)]
*  I just, it was funny to see you texting about it. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2939.04s)]
*  I pushed off a feeding. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2940.8799999999997s)]
*  Oh. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2941.72s)]
*  I said, this is overtime, that baby need to wait. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2942.56s)]
*  Yeah, we got him for this game. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2945.3199999999997s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2946.96s)]
*  It was an incredible game. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2949.7999999999997s)]
*  Everybody watched? [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2951.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2951.9199999999996s)]
*  You see what I'm saying about Patrick Mahomes? [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2952.7599999999998s)]
*  I was happy for you, I'll be honest. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2954.7599999999998s)]
*  I was a little happy for you. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2956.16s)]
*  There was a little part of me that was joyous [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2957.52s)]
*  because you just became a Chiefs fan [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2959.7999999999997s)]
*  and you were gonna lose in overtime. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2961.24s)]
*  And I was gonna come here and I'd be like, [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2962.72s)]
*  that's what you fucking get. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2964.52s)]
*  But there was a part of me that was happy. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2966.36s)]
*  I don't even know, I don't even know [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2968.2s)]
*  how I'll ever actually leave the Cowboys as a fan [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2969.4s)]
*  because I'm so gay and I just keep reading news and stuff. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2971.28s)]
*  But the Chiefs have beaten the Cowboys' biggest rivals [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2973.7599999999998s)]
*  in every Super Bowl. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2977.04s)]
*  The Eagles and the Niners are the two biggest Cowboys. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2978.04s)]
*  So I don't care, I would have loved Patrick Mahomes [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2980.64s)]
*  regardless to keep them from three Super Bowls. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2982.92s)]
*  But he's the best, he might not be the greatest ever [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2985.12s)]
*  because Brady played for 18 years or whatever [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2988.84s)]
*  and won so much and I don't know, that's a long career [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2990.68s)]
*  but nobody's ever been better at quarterback [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2992.68s)]
*  than Patrick Mahomes is right now in this moment in time. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2995.48s)]
*  And I don't even know if it's debatable. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2997.96s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=2999.8799999999997s)]
*  That fucking overtime, when they got the field goal [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3001.6s)]
*  and San Francisco's defense had been [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3004.7999999999997s)]
*  kind of dominating all game and he's like, [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3006.48s)]
*  what do we need to win, we need a touchdown? [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3008.64s)]
*  All right, let's just go get it. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3009.96s)]
*  Did you say better than Brady? [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3011.2s)]
*  Brady at his best was never this good. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3012.96s)]
*  Wow. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3015.3999999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3016.24s)]
*  So longevity. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3017.08s)]
*  Feedback that up. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3017.9199999999996s)]
*  Brady was incredible but I think the reason Brady [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3018.7599999999998s)]
*  is the greatest is the longevity. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3021.92s)]
*  Like Brady didn't win an MVP for his first like 10 years [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3023.6400000000003s)]
*  in the league or some shit like that. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3026.4s)]
*  The number's not right but it took a long time [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3027.8s)]
*  to win his first MVP. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3029.4s)]
*  Mahomes has already won three. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3031.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3032.6800000000003s)]
*  In his first six years I think. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3033.5200000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3035.1600000000003s)]
*  He's been to the NFC Championship game [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3036.0s)]
*  every season he started. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3037.36s)]
*  Yo, you know what's- [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3038.5200000000004s)]
*  I'm sorry, AFC Championship game. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3039.36s)]
*  Every season he started. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3040.2000000000003s)]
*  You always spoke about this when it comes to tennis [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3041.0400000000004s)]
*  but like it's crazy that we just finished the career [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3043.4s)]
*  of the greatest football player in history [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3046.96s)]
*  which is Tom Brady. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3048.7200000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3049.6000000000004s)]
*  Immediately upon his retirement. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3050.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3052.76s)]
*  There's already discussion about is Patrick Mahomes better [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3053.6s)]
*  than the greatest football player in history. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3057.8s)]
*  I mean the guy does, Brady's- [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3059.96s)]
*  Poor Brady, there wasn't even a gap. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3061.88s)]
*  Like with Jordan there still isn't even, [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3063.6s)]
*  like this generation might say LeBron [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3066.28s)]
*  but they don't really know. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3068.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3069.52s)]
*  And it's not really there. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3070.36s)]
*  With Kobe nobody even really, [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3071.2000000000003s)]
*  there was admiration for Kobe [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3073.4s)]
*  but it was never a real debate. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3075.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3077.12s)]
*  Brady's still the goat. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3077.96s)]
*  Again, cause longevity's- [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3079.0s)]
*  But what you're saying is he's not better as a player. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3080.52s)]
*  He's not better. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3083.12s)]
*  And here's one thing I also give Brady credit for. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3084.36s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3086.52s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3087.36s)]
*  It's crazy to say but he's not- [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3088.2s)]
*  I know he's not. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3089.68s)]
*  He's not crazy but it's crazy to say. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3090.52s)]
*  Here's another thing you gotta give Brady credit for [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3092.12s)]
*  that we forget. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3093.68s)]
*  He had an insane ACL tear or something in like 2009. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3094.5s)]
*  He had to get like three or four surgeries. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3097.84s)]
*  So to come back and then win more Super Bowls [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3099.48s)]
*  than you had before, insane. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3101.4s)]
*  Insane, we just kinda forget about that. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3103.48s)]
*  So again, longevity, you gotta say this is the greatest, [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3105.56s)]
*  maybe athlete ever, but just being so good in a moment [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3107.96s)]
*  in time, Patrick Mahomes is flawless. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3111.36s)]
*  He has zero flaws. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3113.36s)]
*  Brady was not athletic. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3115.0s)]
*  Brady's at home eating avocado ice cream right now. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3116.36s)]
*  He's screwing it. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3118.96s)]
*  He's about to come back. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3120.12s)]
*  Mahomes got the dead body, whatever the fuck he wants to. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3121.2s)]
*  Brady eating avocado ice cream, [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3126.2s)]
*  can't get a six yard scramble. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3127.8s)]
*  Patrick Mahomes will get you 30 in overtime. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3129.16s)]
*  I love that they put the ball in his hands. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3131.7200000000003s)]
*  Fourth and one, must have fucked an incredible- [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3133.64s)]
*  They went out and got it. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3135.7200000000003s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3137.04s)]
*  And the play was designed brilliantly [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3137.88s)]
*  in that Travis was there. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3139.12s)]
*  If you really look at the play, [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3141.52s)]
*  it's these are the guys we trust the most on this team. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3143.72s)]
*  And Travis is there to block, [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3146.56s)]
*  but he's also there for a little dump too. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3148.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3150.4s)]
*  Like I guess he has- [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3151.24s)]
*  It's called a run pass option. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3152.08s)]
*  So based on what the 49ers lineman Nick Bosa, [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3153.92s)]
*  who's fucking incredible. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3156.36s)]
*  If Bosa goes for- [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3157.32s)]
*  If he comes down toward the running back, [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3158.9s)]
*  if he like hooks down like that, I think, [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3160.96s)]
*  then Mahomes runs. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3162.48s)]
*  And if Kelsey's open, [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3163.96s)]
*  there's an option for a Kelsey pass for a first down. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3165.48s)]
*  Or he just runs for the first down. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3167.44s)]
*  Or he just runs for the first down and he decided to run. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3168.28s)]
*  But all three options based on what this lineman does, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3169.92s)]
*  just a great, I mean, Andy Reid is amazing. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3172.64s)]
*  But it's a cool play in that like the other team knows [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3175.12s)]
*  the ball is staying in his hands, [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3178.9s)]
*  or it's going to Travis. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3181.7200000000003s)]
*  And they called the play and still executed it. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3183.52s)]
*  That's the thing, it's like you can plan, [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3186.84s)]
*  you can double team it, whatever, [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3188.66s)]
*  but like great players are just gonna make great plays. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3189.76s)]
*  And yeah, it was really awesome to see, man. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3191.92s)]
*  And give it up for Purdy, too. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3195.56s)]
*  Purdy played well, I find. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3197.44s)]
*  He played really well. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3198.76s)]
*  He had some bad throws, I guess, [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3199.6s)]
*  but like that Chiefs defense is fucking good, man. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3200.92s)]
*  They made Lamar Jackson look like not himself. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3202.96s)]
*  Josh Allen, I think, had a pretty good game, [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3205.66s)]
*  but not crazy. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3207.0s)]
*  That kid is nice, bro. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3207.84s)]
*  I think he's underrated. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3209.08s)]
*  Yeah, he's good enough, at least. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3210.08s)]
*  Why didn't they give them a calf for every play? [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3211.4s)]
*  That is a thing that everybody, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3213.32s)]
*  because the Chiefs big flaw defensively is run defense. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3214.76s)]
*  You can run on them. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3218.6800000000003s)]
*  Buffalo was running all over them. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3219.86s)]
*  They just kind of stopped running. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3221.26s)]
*  San Francisco apparently had two drives in a row [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3222.5800000000004s)]
*  in the third quarter. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3225.38s)]
*  They went three and out, [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3226.2200000000003s)]
*  which means they didn't get a single first down. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3227.0600000000004s)]
*  All passes, six straight passes. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3228.7000000000003s)]
*  McCaffrey seems to get six yards every time he runs. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3230.5s)]
*  Why don't you just feed him on these drives? [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3233.46s)]
*  And just Kyle Shanahan is the coach of the 49ers, [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3234.82s)]
*  like this offensive genius, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3238.7000000000003s)]
*  but the big knock on him in every Super Bowl [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3240.26s)]
*  that he's lost is that he should have run [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3242.38s)]
*  in certain moments when he did not. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3244.7000000000003s)]
*  I don't know if y'all remember, [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3246.32s)]
*  he was the offensive coordinator of Atlanta [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3247.6600000000003s)]
*  when they lost up 28-3, like the second to last drive. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3249.58s)]
*  They're up eight, Atlanta is. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3253.86s)]
*  Matt Ryan throws this crazy completion, [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3256.12s)]
*  an insane catch to Julio Jones. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3258.18s)]
*  If they run three times, [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3260.2599999999998s)]
*  they should be able to kick a field goal with like, [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3261.62s)]
*  how much time is left? [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3263.06s)]
*  Oh, because they're gonna keep the clock running [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3263.9s)]
*  but they threw. Keep the clock running. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3265.5s)]
*  And you're like at the 30 yard line, [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3266.98s)]
*  so this is a makeable field goal. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3268.9s)]
*  Let's just run it three times, [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3270.22s)]
*  have a chip shot field goal. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3271.54s)]
*  We go up 11, there's no way the Patriots win. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3272.54s)]
*  They decide to pass. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3275.02s)]
*  This is on the quarterback, too. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3276.36s)]
*  The quarterback takes a sec. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3277.34s)]
*  So now you're out of field goal range. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3278.74s)]
*  You have to punt and instead of an 11 point game [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3281.22s)]
*  that's two possessions, it's an eight point game. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3283.9399999999996s)]
*  Tom Brady obviously gets the ball, scores a touchdown. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3286.02s)]
*  He's got the same home thing where it's like, [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3288.54s)]
*  he's gonna get the touchdown and the two point [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3290.74s)]
*  and they lose the game. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3292.7799999999997s)]
*  Against the Chiefs, they're up 10 in the fourth quarter. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3293.8599999999997s)]
*  There's a play where if they just run, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3296.7799999999997s)]
*  the clock keeps going, you could probably get a first down. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3298.14s)]
*  They try to pass Chris Jones, who's so underrated. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3299.9799999999996s)]
*  The defensive tackle for the Chiefs. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3303.62s)]
*  He knocks it down, they end up having to punt. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3305.22s)]
*  Kansas City get takes the lead on the next possession. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3306.72s)]
*  Then this time, those, every time, [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3308.78s)]
*  just fucking run the clock out or pick up yards [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3311.1800000000003s)]
*  on the ground and there's just always a little pass happen. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3313.94s)]
*  You know what's crazy is to see someone [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3316.82s)]
*  who is so much better than everybody else [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3318.78s)]
*  that at that point in a game, we're talking about [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3321.7400000000002s)]
*  overtime, potentially the last drive, [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3326.0200000000004s)]
*  still does whatever he wants. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3328.82s)]
*  It is unbelievable. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3330.26s)]
*  You can't be just a little better than everybody else [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3331.1600000000003s)]
*  to do whatever you want. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3333.26s)]
*  Think about it like tennis, paddle, basketball, whatever. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3334.1800000000003s)]
*  If you're a little better than the team [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3337.14s)]
*  that you're playing against, you don't do whatever you want. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3338.66s)]
*  You might get some buckets, but you don't do whatever you want. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3340.8599999999997s)]
*  Still scrapping a little. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3343.06s)]
*  You have to be so much better. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3344.18s)]
*  Jordan was so much better than the competition [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3347.94s)]
*  on any given night, he puts up 40 if he wants it. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3350.9s)]
*  Boys and men. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3353.5s)]
*  And that's, I think that's the Patrick Mahomes situation. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3354.3399999999997s)]
*  I was thinking about this, he was playing. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3357.22s)]
*  Didn't even look nervous when he walked out there. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3358.7799999999997s)]
*  Not at all, everybody, and I'm a pessimistic guy. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3360.74s)]
*  Everybody else, so I didn't know if they would score [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3364.22s)]
*  that touchdown, but everybody else that I'm listening to, [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3366.54s)]
*  and I don't think this is hindsight, I think this is real. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3368.5s)]
*  If you're not rooting for Patrick Mahomes, [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3371.66s)]
*  you're like, oh, he's gonna beat us. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3373.5s)]
*  It's over, we fucked up. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3374.94s)]
*  Not scoring that touchdown, it's over. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3376.22s)]
*  And there was a fire thing, like the overtime rules, [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3378.9s)]
*  I guess, were a little bit different, [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3381.14s)]
*  where now, even if you score a touchdown on the first drive, [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3382.5s)]
*  the other team can match. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3385.2599999999998s)]
*  And San Francisco's head coach didn't tell any of the players, [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3386.58s)]
*  he was like, let's receive, because if we score [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3388.9s)]
*  and then they match us, we get the ball back. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3391.54s)]
*  And then the chiefs players were like, [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3393.94s)]
*  we met twice a week every week in the playoffs [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3396.42s)]
*  talking about this exact scenario, [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3397.5s)]
*  and we said we want the ball second. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3399.1400000000003s)]
*  We were shocked they took it first, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3401.3s)]
*  because we figured if they score a touchdown, [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3402.7000000000003s)]
*  and this is having Patrick Mahomes, [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3404.46s)]
*  then we'll just go down and score a touchdown, [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3406.1000000000004s)]
*  and then we'll go for two and win the game. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3407.5s)]
*  Now, here's the thing. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3409.1800000000003s)]
*  Now, I love that, but there is something, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3410.6200000000003s)]
*  I have to say about that. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3414.3s)]
*  How much accountability do we have to give the players [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3415.1000000000004s)]
*  to learn the rules of the game? [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3417.5800000000004s)]
*  Like, bare minimum, if you're a player, [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3418.98s)]
*  you should know the rules of the game. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3421.7400000000002s)]
*  I love the fact that KC is so organized [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3422.78s)]
*  that they're going to basically work out every scenario [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3425.02s)]
*  and make sure the players know, [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3428.74s)]
*  but like, bro, you're a NFL football player [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3429.94s)]
*  and you don't know the rules of overtime? [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3433.38s)]
*  Get a YouTube link in the group chat or something. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3434.94s)]
*  What do you mean they don't know the rules? [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3437.34s)]
*  They had just changed the rules this playoffs to be, [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3438.18s)]
*  I didn't know, I had no idea. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3440.42s)]
*  And it's only- But you only get paid to play football. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3442.42s)]
*  These motherfuckers- [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3444.22s)]
*  Only applies in the playoffs. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3445.2599999999998s)]
*  Regular season is the same rules. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3446.58s)]
*  Ah, yeah, this is the first year [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3448.1s)]
*  that the playoffs were this way. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3449.82s)]
*  Also, I like the rule change. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3450.66s)]
*  I think it makes more sense. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3452.3s)]
*  It makes way more sense. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3453.14s)]
*  It shouldn't have impacted this Super Bowl [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3454.02s)]
*  because the old rules, like the five-year-old rule is, [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3455.22s)]
*  if you kick a field goal first, [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3457.9s)]
*  the other team has a chance to match, [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3459.06s)]
*  and if you score a touchdown, it's over. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3460.58s)]
*  Yeah, it technically isn't different, [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3462.1s)]
*  but it was different this year. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3464.14s)]
*  I think what happened is that [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3465.94s)]
*  it takes away the time component. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3467.54s)]
*  So let's say you're on a long drive on the way down [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3469.18s)]
*  and you eat up nine minutes o'clock. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3472.7s)]
*  The other team, yeah, they have a chance to score, [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3475.3s)]
*  but they would only have three minutes left [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3477.98s)]
*  for however long the overtime period was left [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3479.5s)]
*  in order for them to score. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3481.5s)]
*  And also, if they score a touchdown, [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3482.34s)]
*  I don't get the ball at all. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3483.38s)]
*  It's just over. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3484.42s)]
*  Like, what the fuck is that? [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3485.26s)]
*  It saves that golden goal scenario [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3486.1000000000004s)]
*  where it's just first one to get it actually scores. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3487.6600000000003s)]
*  Guys, while we're talking about the Super Bowl, [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3490.5s)]
*  you should know you can keep playing prize picks [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3492.34s)]

*  Let's get back to the motherfucking show. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3520.1800000000003s)]
*  All right, do you think Taylor thought [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3522.3s)]
*  she was getting proposed to? [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3523.9s)]
*  I hoped she would. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3526.0600000000004s)]
*  You didn't think? [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3527.78s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3528.6200000000003s)]
*  Everything is so calculated that she would know? [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3529.46s)]
*  I'm assuming. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3531.5s)]
*  Like, maybe in the back of your head, [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3532.34s)]
*  you're like, oh, is it gonna be a double blind, [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3533.5400000000004s)]
*  whatever, whatever, but like. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3536.0600000000004s)]
*  Yo, second Travis Kelsey grabbed that mic, [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3537.1000000000004s)]
*  and he's good on the mic. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3540.0600000000004s)]
*  I ain't gonna front. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3540.98s)]
*  He got me hyped. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3541.82s)]
*  But the second he grabbed it, I was like, [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3542.6600000000003s)]
*  we not getting a proposal tonight. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3544.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3545.98s)]
*  He was singing fucking Beastie Boys. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3547.3s)]
*  I was like, Taylor is not getting a ring today, baby. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3549.86s)]
*  This is about Travis. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3552.7000000000003s)]
*  She was chilling on the side. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3554.26s)]
*  As it should have been. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3556.06s)]
*  Like, it's his day. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3556.9s)]
*  Like, if he would have proposed, [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3557.86s)]
*  it would have been all about Taylor, [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3559.78s)]
*  and it was already about Taylor, just too much. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3561.5s)]
*  Yo, yo, you know, this poor girl can't win, bro. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3564.26s)]
*  I think we talked about this maybe before, [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3567.8s)]
*  but like, literally, she has four sold out shows in Tokyo, [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3569.34s)]
*  hops on a jet to be at her boyfriend's, [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3574.1800000000003s)]
*  it's not even her husband's, her boyfriend's, [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3576.3s)]
*  her boyfriend's, her boyfriend's game, or whatever, [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3579.2200000000003s)]
*  Super Bowl, obviously, big game. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3583.9s)]
*  She comes to every single one of the fucking games. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3585.3s)]
*  She has to organize how many people's lives have to move [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3587.2200000000003s)]
*  so she can go to this game. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3590.1800000000003s)]
*  All the security guards, all of her traveling people, [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3591.38s)]
*  maybe some of her management, [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3594.3s)]
*  because she probably still has to do work in between, [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3595.94s)]
*  she's probably traveling 10, 15 people [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3597.9s)]
*  every time she goes. Think how exhausted you are, too. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3601.3s)]
*  Four sold out shows, everybody talks about [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3603.94s)]
*  how much she puts into her show, [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3606.14s)]
*  from fucking Japan, I gotta go. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3607.7000000000003s)]
*  And they hating on her because the NFL is using her. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3610.58s)]
*  Not even she's using it. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3615.26s)]
*  The NFL, hate on the NFL. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3617.5s)]
*  Say fuck the NFL. Yeah, but she can ask the NFL, [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3619.9s)]
*  yo, hey, don't cut to me that much. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3622.46s)]
*  Can she? Yes. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3624.46s)]
*  And they would listen to her. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3625.6600000000003s)]
*  They would listen to her. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3627.06s)]
*  You don't think so? [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3628.14s)]
*  I heard, there's a rumor that she got Kanye [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3628.98s)]
*  kicked out of the Super Bowl. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3632.22s)]
*  Did he get kicked out? [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3633.94s)]
*  I mean, there's a rumor, I don't know, [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3634.78s)]
*  that he bought the seats right in front of Taylor, [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3636.62s)]
*  and Taylor was like, NFL, if he's there. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3639.62s)]
*  I have a history of hating on Taylor, we all know this. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3642.46s)]
*  This is crazy, the way she's getting hated on for this. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3645.38s)]
*  Like, son, she's watching her boyfriend, she's, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3647.78s)]
*  and then early on people were like, why she? [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3651.14s)]
*  Nobody gets more hate, bro. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3653.14s)]
*  Nobody gets more hate that's probably a good person. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3654.1s)]
*  Like, there are people that get hate. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3657.7000000000003s)]
*  I could agree with that. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3658.54s)]
*  But yeah, like, nobody gets more hate [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3659.36s)]
*  that's probably a good human being. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3660.9s)]
*  I don't even know about probably a good human. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3662.98s)]
*  But she definitely likes the attention. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3664.34s)]
*  Yo, she's a star, they're all into, [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3666.06s)]
*  they like, addicted to the attention, they need it. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3668.1s)]
*  But in order to be that much of a superstar, [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3670.7000000000003s)]
*  you probably have to be into, okay, so she gets it, [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3673.6400000000003s)]
*  but the reality is, she's showing up for her man, [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3675.92s)]
*  all these people online complaining, [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3678.54s)]
*  your girlfriend don't even go to your fucking rec league games. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3679.94s)]
*  They never once supported you, [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3682.54s)]
*  so what the fuck are you crying about her for? [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3683.82s)]
*  The fact that she's at every single fucking game. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3686.1400000000003s)]
*  Do you think she's flying to this game [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3687.98s)]
*  for NFL cameras to be on her, [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3690.1800000000003s)]
*  as if she doesn't have enough attention? [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3691.86s)]
*  Yo, she could go to any restaurant. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3693.1s)]
*  What do you think is her purpose of, [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3693.94s)]
*  I'm not saying this at you, I'm saying this at these people. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3695.26s)]
*  Sorry, yeah, that was at you, but you're defending them, [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3697.7400000000002s)]
*  so I'm just saying at them. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3699.84s)]
*  Do you guys think Taylor Swift is flying from Japan [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3701.2200000000003s)]
*  to the Super Bowl because she's like, [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3703.82s)]
*  I need more attention. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3705.3s)]
*  She just sold four stadium shows in Japan, [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3706.9s)]
*  tabloids talk about her all the time. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3710.46s)]
*  She's not like, hey, let me fly 20 hours overnight [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3712.2200000000003s)]
*  after four sold out shows so I can get a little more camera. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3715.1s)]
*  That's a great point, the argument that she's doing it [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3717.94s)]
*  for attention. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3720.2999999999997s)]
*  Are you fucking crazy, dude? [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3721.14s)]
*  She's the most famous musician on the planet, [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3721.96s)]
*  one of the most famous human beings on planet Earth. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3723.58s)]
*  Fucking billionaire. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3725.38s)]
*  She doesn't need more attention, she needs less attention. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3726.22s)]
*  She sold out of Legion twice, Travis only did one. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3728.66s)]
*  No, no, she sold out of Legion, oh, sorry, sorry, [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3731.54s)]
*  Legion is Vegas. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3733.86s)]
*  In LA it was four or five. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3735.5s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3736.94s)]
*  Travis did it, and this is a Derek Poston line [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3737.9s)]
*  when it comes to this, but whenever we do an arena, [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3740.98s)]
*  Derek always goes, yo, you know what's crazy? [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3743.5s)]
*  It took two basketball teams to sell this out. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3745.74s)]
*  Yeah, that's five. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3748.58s)]
*  And so she sold out of Legion, it took two football teams, [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3750.06s)]
*  and the fucking Super Bowl to sell that shit. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3753.9s)]
*  And I don't even think the Chargers sell out of Legion. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3756.54s)]
*  And if they do it, it's eight times. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3759.78s)]
*  She did it five, on her own. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3761.42s)]
*  Do you think she's like, hey, let's fly cross-continent [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3764.02s)]
*  so I can get less than 60 seconds of air time [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3767.7s)]
*  on the Super Bowl? [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3769.94s)]
*  If she wanted to do the halftime show, [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3770.94s)]
*  do you think they're gonna be like, well, no, [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3773.7000000000003s)]
*  we got a lineup for a few years set. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3776.1000000000004s)]
*  Next year she could say today, I wanna do the halftime show. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3778.3s)]
*  If she really wants attention, I wanna do the halftime show [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3780.98s)]
*  and the NFL would be fucking giddy. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3783.34s)]
*  But she should wait a couple years [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3785.7000000000003s)]
*  because you don't wanna follow Usher. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3787.1800000000003s)]
*  Usher, put that shit down. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3788.6200000000003s)]
*  I don't think anybody wants to follow Usher, bro. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3790.1800000000003s)]
*  Yesterday I believed in racism yesterday. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3792.7000000000003s)]
*  Finally. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3795.5s)]
*  It took me watching Usher, going on Twitter. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3796.5400000000004s)]
*  Feminist, what on the world's up here? [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3799.54s)]
*  Have a kid, it's gonna change your life. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3801.46s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3803.66s)]
*  I go on Twitter, I go Usher. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3804.7s)]
*  I go Usher period, unbelievable period. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3807.1s)]
*  King period, something like that. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3810.62s)]
*  Immediate reactions are like, you thought that was good? [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3812.74s)]
*  That shit sucked. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3816.14s)]
*  That was one of the words, I'm like, oh. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3817.14s)]
*  I thought I was crazy. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3819.14s)]
*  Racism exists. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3820.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3820.98s)]
*  Racism exists. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3821.82s)]
*  The only way that you could not think that was great [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3822.74s)]
*  is if you're smart. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3825.78s)]
*  No. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3828.6s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3829.44s)]
*  I don't know if it's not racism, [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3832.12s)]
*  but the fact that there are people so ready to fucking hate. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3833.4s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3837.24s)]
*  You decided to hate that before Usher went up there. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3838.08s)]
*  They would have been like, yo, Morgan Weller [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3840.7599999999998s)]
*  wanna destroy that shit. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3842.48s)]
*  And again, I don't know if it's racism, [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3844.44s)]
*  but there is something else. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3845.68s)]
*  There's another cultural phenomenon happening here [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3847.08s)]
*  that they decided that they were gonna hate [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3849.64s)]
*  on that performance before he even did it. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3851.16s)]
*  I don't know what it is, [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3854.24s)]
*  but I understand why I feel such a pressure [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3855.6s)]
*  to be a perfectionist because we watched it [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3857.68s)]
*  and I was sitting there watching it [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3859.92s)]
*  and Usher's just killing it with the fucking roller skates, [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3861.0s)]
*  having an amazing time, the end. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3863.0s)]
*  I'm standing up in the living room, [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3864.36s)]
*  I'm like, yo, this guy's the fucking best. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3865.64s)]
*  Look at the family group chat. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3867.12s)]
*  My uncle just goes, horrible. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3868.36s)]
*  So it is racism. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3870.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3871.24s)]
*  Yeah, it is, it is. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3872.08s)]
*  People don't like black people. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3873.92s)]
*  It turns out people don't like black people. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3875.04s)]
*  I mean, it is crazy. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3877.88s)]
*  I bet they liked them when they were playing [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3878.92s)]
*  really good for the fucking chiefs. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3880.24s)]

*  That's the thing I was like. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3884.76s)]
*  Racism is real now? [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3887.36s)]
*  You telling me racism is real? [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=3888.76s)]

*  Also, because he could possibly expose him, [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4369.96s)]
*  because there was a couple sleepovers early on in his career [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4371.8s)]
*  and I was a little weird. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4374.92s)]
*  Yeah, maybe this is what he meant, that's it. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4375.76s)]
*  Never again! [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4377.16s)]
*  Fighting over cornflakes and shit. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4378.6s)]
*  What was this? [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4381.16s)]
*  It was Diddy was saying. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4382.0s)]
*  Fighting over cornflakes. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4382.84s)]
*  What's Diddy's thing with food? [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4385.08s)]
*  Go to Brooklyn and get me a cheese cake, what is it? [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4387.88s)]
*  It was Diddy, Usher, and I think Kevin Hart. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4390.0s)]
*  Diddy just talking about, oh yeah, [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4393.0s)]
*  I had Usher in my crib early. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4394.88s)]
*  There was times we would be in the bed wrestling, [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4397.04s)]
*  fighting over cornflakes. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4399.28s)]
*  Kevin Hart's like, what the fuck did you just say? [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4401.72s)]
*  And he wouldn't let it die. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4404.36s)]
*  Diddy comes over to him and puts him in a headlock, [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4408.28s)]
*  and you can tell he really put some pressure on it, [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4411.0s)]
*  to like, yo, shut the fuck up. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4413.76s)]
*  This is old, old, old, old. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4417.84s)]
*  This is like Kevin Hart. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4419.16s)]
*  Diddy out of here. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4420.8s)]
*  It's over for Diddy. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4422.0s)]
*  You see him apply a little pressure, shut the fuck up. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4425.44s)]
*  I mean, I believe it. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4431.639999999999s)]
*  He's fresh off of Goddard Plain. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4432.76s)]
*  That's just, that's just. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4434.36s)]
*  Fresh off the Goddard stage. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4437.16s)]
*  That's my brother right here. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4438.36s)]
*  Day one, we used to wake up, and I mean, damn, pause. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4439.52s)]
*  But like, I mean, back in the days when he was like 10 [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4442.92s)]
*  and I was a little bit older, his older brother, [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4446.92s)]
*  we used to fight over the frosted flakes. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4448.92s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4451.48s)]
*  Before pause was invented. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4452.32s)]
*  But it's my brother for real. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4454.8s)]
*  We used to actually wrestle off of the frosted flakes [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4455.96s)]
*  because he used to always get up early. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4459.68s)]
*  And now he's one of the richest guys in the world. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4461.56s)]
*  Yo, what the fuck did I just say? [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4463.96s)]
*  Damn, I wish he showed the end of it. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4466.96s)]
*  Because you see how Diddy just like, [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4470.16s)]
*  yo, don't be making fun of me. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4472.16s)]
*  Oh man. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4474.56s)]
*  Oh God, what a legend Kevin is, dude. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4476.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, that's fire. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4478.12s)]
*  Oh, that's great. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4479.24s)]
*  That's fire. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4480.08s)]
*  You see Biden lean into the Super Bowl conspiracy shit? [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4481.0s)]
*  Yeah, I saw that. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4484.12s)]
*  What'd you think? [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4484.96s)]
*  He don't know what he's doing. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4485.8s)]
*  That's just the Twitter account. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4486.62s)]
*  But I like that they've done that. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4487.46s)]
*  It seems like every candidate is genuinely concerned [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4489.76s)]
*  about Taylor's endorsement. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4491.76s)]
*  They are genuinely concerned. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4494.8s)]
*  That's how much power she has as an individual. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4496.320000000001s)]
*  Oh, because Trump was begging for it. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4498.68s)]
*  Trump's beefing with her now. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4501.56s)]
*  No, no, they're beefing. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4502.96s)]
*  I thought he came out begging. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4503.96s)]
*  That's a bad move. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4505.16s)]
*  He's taking a shot at it. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4506.72s)]
*  Taking shots at her too. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4507.72s)]
*  No, that's not a Trump shot. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4509.28s)]
*  That's a Trump compliment. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4511.64s)]
*  So he goes, you got the quote? [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4513.08s)]
*  He basically said something about Taylor [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4515.16s)]
*  or whatever I got, and then he goes, [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4517.88s)]
*  and I really like her boyfriend, Travis, [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4519.04s)]
*  even though he probably hates me because he's a liberal. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4521.12s)]
*  But he's saying, I really like you. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4523.32s)]
*  He's begging for that vote. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4526.04s)]
*  He's begging for that endorsement. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4527.28s)]
*  There's no way she endorses either one. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4528.4s)]
*  Well, in the past, she is. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4530.5599999999995s)]
*  She has kind of leaned left. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4531.88s)]
*  She endorsed Biden in 2020, I think. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4533.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4535.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4536.48s)]
*  Yeah, Swiftie. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4538.04s)]
*  I think they're genuinely concerned about it. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4539.44s)]
*  I was reading some shit kind of like, [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4540.88s)]
*  it seems like conservative pundits [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4542.92s)]
*  are trying to smear Taylor and basically be like, [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4544.76s)]
*  look, the NFL is rigged. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4548.08s)]
*  This whole thing is a setup. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4549.4s)]
*  Oh, that's what that is. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4550.48s)]
*  That was a part of the experience. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4551.32s)]
*  It was like, look, this is what a lot of people were saying. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4552.44s)]
*  Again, I don't know if it's true [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4554.32s)]
*  or if this is like left disinformation. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4555.16s)]
*  I don't know what the fuck's going on, [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4556.839999999999s)]
*  but apparently it was like, yeah, [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4557.679999999999s)]
*  we don't want them to win [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4559.04s)]
*  because Taylor's gonna get on the mic [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4560.24s)]
*  or she's gonna tweet after the Super Bowl with Travis. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4561.599999999999s)]
*  She's gonna endorse Biden publicly. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4563.879999999999s)]
*  And that's what the whole NFL wants. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4565.5199999999995s)]
*  That's what the liberal establishment wants. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4567.48s)]
*  And it's like- [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4569.48s)]
*  So they're trying to make her radioactive? [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4570.32s)]
*  And try to like smear her, try to like intimidate her [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4571.5199999999995s)]
*  and get her to shut up [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4573.879999999999s)]
*  because they don't want her to be endorsing Biden. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4574.719999999999s)]
*  Don't go against Taylor, yo. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4577.5199999999995s)]
*  Shit. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4578.839999999999s)]
*  Don't go against Taylor, right? [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4579.679999999999s)]
*  But that does make sense [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4580.96s)]
*  because I'm seeing all these right-wing Twitter accounts [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4582.52s)]
*  hate Taylor now and I'm like, [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4584.76s)]
*  shouldn't that be y'all's queen? [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4586.2s)]
*  Like, can you imagine a bunch of like black whatever [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4587.84s)]
*  going at Beyonce? [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4590.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4591.68s)]
*  Which has never happened. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4592.52s)]
*  And Taylor is, she's white Beyonce. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4593.34s)]
*  So it's like, seeing y'all go at her [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4595.24s)]
*  don't make no sense to me, but it makes sense. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4597.16s)]
*  You think she might vote less. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4598.84s)]
*  I think Beyonce is black Taylor, [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4599.68s)]
*  but yeah, we don't have to, we don't have to. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4600.52s)]
*  Come on. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4603.04s)]

*  We don't have to split- Maybe next year. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4607.16s)]
*  Good hairs about this. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4608.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4610.68s)]
*  But yeah, I think that makes sense [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4612.8s)]
*  why they would suddenly start hating on it [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4614.280000000001s)]
*  because it made no sense. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4616.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4617.0s)]
*  They better chill out. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4617.84s)]
*  I think they're all trying to get the, [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4618.66s)]
*  trying to get the endorsement, which is crazy. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4619.5s)]
*  That she's in a position where she gets [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4621.280000000001s)]
*  influencing global politics. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4622.64s)]
*  I saw a thing that said like 10% of people [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4623.92s)]
*  said their vote would be swayed by Taylor. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4625.4800000000005s)]
*  She got 35,000 people to register last fall [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4627.320000000001s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4634.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean, a real post might do 10 times that. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4635.320000000001s)]
*  And if you're talking about elections close to the last one, [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4637.0s)]
*  it's like- [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4638.6s)]
*  35K. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4639.4400000000005s)]
*  That's a lot of people. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4641.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4642.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4643.280000000001s)]
*  All right, guys, we're gonna take a break real quick [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4644.12s)]
*  because some of you have a bad habit [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4645.360000000001s)]
*  that we cannot name because of YouTube rules [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4647.8s)]
*  and restrictions. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4650.92s)]
*  And I don't wanna get this episode pulled, [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4651.92s)]
*  but you have a bad habit that you need to break. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4653.240000000001s)]
*  It can give you lung cancer, emphysema, heart disease, [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4655.360000000001s)]
*  God knows what else, [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4657.84s)]
*  but quitting that bad habit cold turkey is hard. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4658.84s)]
*  So here is your solution. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4662.240000000001s)]
*  Fume. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4664.04s)]
*  It's not about giving up. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4664.88s)]
*  It's about switching up. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4665.72s)]
*  Fume, instead of just quitting that habit, [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4666.88s)]
*  takes it, replaces it with something that is healthier, [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4669.7s)]
*  better, a whole lot more enjoyable. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4672.74s)]
*  It's an award-winning flavored air device, okay? [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4674.3s)]
*  So instead of vapor, it uses flavored air. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4677.74s)]
*  Instead of electronics, it's completely natural. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4679.98s)]
*  Look, I am, I'm sober like October, baby. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4681.94s)]
*  That was pretty stupid. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4685.0599999999995s)]
*  Didn't make any sense, but I said it. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4686.46s)]
*  Either way, watch this. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4688.0599999999995s)]
*  You know why? [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4690.5s)]
*  Because there's no harmful chemicals in there. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4691.34s)]
*  It's all natural. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4692.5s)]
*  So you get what I'm saying. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4693.42s)]
*  Instead of bad, a bad habit, fume is good. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4694.38s)]
*  It's a habit you're free to enjoy [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4697.42s)]
*  and makes replacing that bad habit easy. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4698.86s)]
*  Also comes with an adjustable airflow dial. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4701.259999999999s)]
*  And this I love. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4703.2s)]
*  It's just an removable part. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4704.04s)]
*  You hear a little clicking? [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4705.0199999999995s)]
*  It just makes you feel a little less anxious. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4706.08s)]
*  Gives your fingers something to do. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4707.86s)]
*  Very helpful for de-stressing. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4709.44s)]
*  Great taste, guys. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4711.139999999999s)]

*  Now here's the thing though. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4894.96s)]
*  Underneath it all, there was some desperation. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4896.66s)]
*  That's what I picked up on. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4902.1s)]
*  Why would you do this? [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4903.38s)]
*  Yes. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4904.900000000001s)]
*  He's bragging about like, oh, we have hypersonic technology [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4905.74s)]
*  better than everybody else, and oh, we have the number one [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4908.38s)]
*  economy in Europe, and all that. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4910.26s)]
*  If everything's going so great in your country [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4912.900000000001s)]
*  and geopolitically for you, and the relationships [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4917.66s)]
*  that you've built are just flourishing, [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4919.7s)]
*  you don't do an interview with a incredibly popular [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4922.22s)]
*  American journalist that you know is going to be put on [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4928.5s)]
*  over here. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4931.62s)]
*  You're doing this, I presume, because you're trying [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4932.46s)]
*  to influence the American public to put Trump back [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4936.58s)]
*  in the election because you think Trump will stop the war. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4939.58s)]
*  And I mean, Uyeda said something interesting. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4943.62s)]
*  He goes, listen, the war between Russia and Ukraine [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4945.94s)]
*  is in triple overtime, and Russia's supposed to be [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4948.5s)]
*  a superpower, and Ukraine is basically just getting [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4951.179999999999s)]
*  weapons from Russia. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4953.66s)]
*  Yeah, this should have been mercy-ruled. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4954.5s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4955.82s)]
*  So it's like, why is this in triple overtime? [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4956.66s)]
*  So I think Putin, and if you notice, [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4958.099999999999s)]
*  he said he hasn't spoken to Biden in a couple years. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4960.38s)]
*  It could be that the Americans are just not communicating. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4962.62s)]
*  He's like, yes, our organizations talk to one another. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4965.38s)]
*  Okay, maybe they do, maybe they don't. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4967.42s)]
*  But it seemed to me as more of a desperate move. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4969.02s)]
*  You want to influence the election, [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4973.26s)]
*  you hope that Trump wins, but if he doesn't, [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4975.58s)]
*  you want to leave that conversation open [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4977.860000000001s)]
*  to potentially ending this conflict. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4980.14s)]
*  Because he kept saying, we had an agreement, [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4981.82s)]
*  we wanted to stop. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4983.54s)]
*  We want peace. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4984.5s)]
*  We're being reasonable people, we want peace. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4985.34s)]
*  And then he brought up a couple things that I thought [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4987.74s)]
*  were kind of goofy that he undermined his whole argument with. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4989.5s)]
*  Like what? [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4992.58s)]
*  Using the, I mean, Canada's just a bunch of fucking retards [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4993.42s)]
*  for bringing the Ukrainian Nazi in there. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4996.58s)]
*  But he used it as if it was done on purpose [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=4999.02s)]
*  because the guy was a Nazi. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5002.94s)]
*  Right. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5004.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5005.5s)]
*  Like as if he was brought there for his Nazi behavior. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5006.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5009.78s)]
*  I think what is a miscalculation by a bunch of dumb idiots [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5010.9s)]
*  in office in Canada, where they should have looked [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5013.82s)]
*  at the most basic thing, which is like, [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5016.7s)]
*  what side was fighting against Russia during World War II? [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5018.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5024.58s)]
*  Clearly Germany, right? [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5025.42s)]
*  Absolute retards. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5028.26s)]
*  And the guy is getting up there, [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5029.099999999999s)]
*  the fucking Ukrainian Nazi guy was up there, [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5030.18s)]
*  going, thank you, finally, you see what we've been waiting [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5032.78s)]
*  for this moment. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5036.94s)]
*  Now we got George Santos. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5039.099999999999s)]
*  We have our line. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5041.74s)]
*  So it's like, I don't know, but to me, it just had this like. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5043.3s)]
*  There is a wise philosopher once said, [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5047.62s)]
*  if you're explaining, you're losing. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5049.3s)]
*  Tom Brady. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5050.78s)]
*  Tom Brady. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5051.62s)]
*  For real, and he did a lot of explaining. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5052.46s)]
*  Crazy number two of all time. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5054.3s)]
*  So he goes, this is why Ukraine should actually be, [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5056.5s)]
*  these are Russian people and there's a Russian soul, [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5061.5s)]
*  all this explaining is going through the history [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5064.74s)]
*  and all this stuff. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5067.0199999999995s)]
*  It's like, listen, the history of America [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5067.86s)]
*  is that we were part of England. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5069.62s)]
*  Does that mean that, like that's his argument. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5071.54s)]
*  It's like, these are ethnically the same people. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5073.46s)]
*  Yeah, who gives a fuck if you're ethnically the same? [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5075.26s)]
*  You go out to the Balkans, outside of the Albanians, [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5077.14s)]
*  they're ethnically all the same people. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5079.46s)]
*  Does that mean that they should all be the same country? [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5081.3s)]
*  No, they've been fighting to be separate countries [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5083.18s)]
*  for the last few hundred years. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5084.860000000001s)]
*  Can Mexico annex like Southern Texas or something? [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5086.9800000000005s)]
*  Because Mexicans live there. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5089.14s)]
*  Yeah, he's very educated and when people are speaking [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5090.34s)]
*  about things that we don't know, [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5094.9800000000005s)]
*  we have a tendency to believe them [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5097.26s)]
*  because we can't exactly refute. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5098.700000000001s)]
*  I can't refute Russian history. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5100.820000000001s)]
*  I don't really know enough about it. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5101.900000000001s)]
*  Just frankly, I don't. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5103.700000000001s)]
*  But it did seem that he really desired something [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5104.9s)]
*  and if things are going so well, [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5109.179999999999s)]
*  your desires from foreign nations are not as high [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5110.94s)]
*  as they are if you're doing a Tucker Carlson interview. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5113.58s)]
*  No, he's stepping into an information war. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5116.82s)]
*  He's attempting to control his narrative [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5118.62s)]
*  and the narrative of his country [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5120.54s)]
*  to try to sway public opinion, specifically in America. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5121.66s)]
*  So, and he has historically hasn't really done that [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5124.74s)]
*  in the West because he didn't really need to. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5128.219999999999s)]
*  I mean, obviously, if you don't include [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5129.58s)]
*  political interference through ads and shit, [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5132.38s)]
*  through the elections and stuff, [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5135.54s)]
*  to have a public information war is very out of character. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5136.66s)]
*  So I agree with you. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5138.94s)]
*  I think it is kind of symptomatic of like, [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5139.78s)]
*  yeah, we kind of just need to get some support a little bit. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5142.66s)]
*  And he's a strong enough leader that I think he knows, [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5147.179999999999s)]
*  oh, we can kind of pull some people. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5150.94s)]
*  And Americans are falling for it. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5153.0199999999995s)]
*  I've seen a lot of people go, [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5154.98s)]
*  oh, this is what a strong leader looks like [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5156.62s)]
*  and they're trying to justify his positions. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5158.66s)]
*  And he is elegant in his approach to things. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5160.46s)]
*  There's a strength, but also an elegance. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5165.86s)]
*  I'm not gonna be one of these guys who goes, [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5168.22s)]
*  oh, look at this fucking idiot. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5169.78s)]
*  He's not a baboon at all. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5170.9800000000005s)]
*  This guy's managed to maintain control [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5172.34s)]
*  of a country of over 150 million people for decades. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5175.7s)]
*  That's fucking hard. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5178.9s)]
*  With staggering support amongst the population, [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5181.22s)]
*  people love him there. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5185.38s)]
*  It's not like he's this like hated leader. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5186.66s)]
*  There are detractors for sure, [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5189.08s)]
*  but I think the majority of the population [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5190.5199999999995s)]
*  is very happy with Putin from things that have happened. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5192.32s)]
*  Yeah, legitimately happy or? [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5195.24s)]
*  Again, we don't know. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5197.2s)]
*  Again, we don't know, but from what I understand. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5198.04s)]
*  But yeah, it just feels like he's praying [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5202.4s)]
*  that Trump gets in there, [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5207.76s)]
*  because he wants an end to this. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5208.96s)]
*  Now, here's the thing that's interesting. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5210.48s)]
*  When they say we're giving aid to Ukraine, [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5212.4s)]
*  I didn't realize what it really meant. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5215.5199999999995s)]
*  We're not giving them any money. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5218.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5219.84s)]
*  Did you guys know that? [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5220.96s)]
*  Yeah, we're giving them weapons. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5221.8s)]
*  We're giving us money. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5223.08s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5225.5599999999995s)]
*  So, Congress agrees on the aid package. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5226.4s)]
*  Let's call it $5 billion or $10 billion. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5230.0s)]
*  That $10 billion is not deployed to Ukraine. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5232.26s)]
*  It's deployed to Raytheon. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5235.36s)]
*  It's deployed to Boston Dynamics or whatever. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5237.42s)]
*  It's deployed to Boeing. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5240.28s)]
*  It's deployed to what we would commonly call [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5241.36s)]
*  the military industrial complex in America. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5243.96s)]
*  So, the money isn't going there. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5246.24s)]
*  It's going to American companies that hire Americans, [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5248.76s)]
*  that are employing Americans. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5252.78s)]
*  It continues to filter in our economy, not their economy. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5255.0s)]
*  And one thing we always read is war is good [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5259.16s)]
*  for the American economy. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5260.88s)]
*  So, I wonder if there's an argument to be made, [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5261.84s)]
*  and maybe they would never, as Vivek would put it, [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5265.16s)]
*  the managerial class would never come out and say it, [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5267.36s)]
*  but I wonder if they would say, [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5269.12s)]
*  hey, the managerial class, [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5270.599999999999s)]
*  I wonder if their conversations are basically going, [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5272.36s)]
*  please, Americans, shut the fuck up. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5274.88s)]
*  This is why we're coming out of COVID [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5276.32s)]
*  better than anybody else. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5278.56s)]
*  We basically manufactured a war [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5279.56s)]
*  to keep the economy pumping, [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5281.68s)]
*  because when these weapons companies are building stuff, [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5283.16s)]
*  they still need steel from wherever the steel plants [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5286.76s)]
*  that we're buying from. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5289.8s)]
*  We need things shipped. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5290.62s)]
*  We need screws. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5291.4800000000005s)]
*  We need paper. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5292.72s)]
*  We need employees to build it all. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5293.6s)]
*  Yeah, we need secretaries to push the paper. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5295.64s)]
*  We need everything. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5297.76s)]
*  These are massive companies. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5299.08s)]
*  Now, I'm not saying that we should go to war [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5300.4800000000005s)]
*  for this reason, [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5302.32s)]
*  but I think that the way that it's being positioned [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5303.16s)]
*  by a lot of people is very simple. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5305.2s)]
*  It's a drain on our economy. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5307.04s)]
*  Yeah, here's the money in America. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5307.96s)]
*  Instead of helping out Americans, [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5309.5199999999995s)]
*  we just give it to the Ukrainians, [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5310.88s)]
*  and now they buy soup with it. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5312.28s)]
*  It's like an organic stimulus check. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5313.88s)]
*  So, the criticism would be like, [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5317.84s)]
*  well, it's just helping these wealthy companies. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5318.98s)]
*  Those wealthy companies have people. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5322.5599999999995s)]
*  They buy pools, right? [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5324.0s)]
*  They buy houses. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5325.2s)]
*  They rent apartments. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5326.12s)]
*  Yeah, which you can argue with, [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5326.96s)]
*  but then you're just arguing the economic policy [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5327.8s)]
*  of trickle down or whatever. Exactly. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5328.92s)]
*  Which is fine. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5330.48s)]
*  You can argue that if you want to. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5331.32s)]
*  You might be right, [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5332.139999999999s)]
*  but it isn't money that's hemorrhaging [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5333.82s)]
*  from the US economy and going to Ukraine. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5334.78s)]
*  Are you sure we're not just giving them [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5336.62s)]
*  direct money as well? [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5337.459999999999s)]
*  I thought it's both. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5338.82s)]
*  I imagine that there's a certain amount of it [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5340.459999999999s)]
*  that needs to go there to utilize these weapons. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5342.98s)]
*  Maybe there's getting the weapons over there [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5348.0599999999995s)]
*  is another thing, [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5350.339999999999s)]
*  but still, we're probably not hiring Ukrainian companies [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5351.339999999999s)]
*  to bring the weapons over there. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5354.0199999999995s)]
*  Right, or even food support and rations and shit [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5355.5s)]
*  for troops, all that stuff. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5358.32s)]
*  Okay, so maybe there's some food and that kind of stuff, [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5360.099999999999s)]
*  but where is the food made? [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5361.7s)]
*  Exactly, no, to your point, [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5362.98s)]
*  it might not only be weapons. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5363.9s)]
*  It's like a stimulus, like you were saying, [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5365.34s)]
*  I think for the American economy, [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5367.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm not saying we should do it, [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5368.14s)]
*  and I'm not saying we should be involved [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5369.1s)]
*  in these foreign wars. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5370.1s)]
*  I would prefer that, listen, [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5370.94s)]
*  I would love there to be some sort of agreement [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5372.58s)]
*  that stops it completely. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5374.98s)]
*  That being said, the way that it's being positioned [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5376.38s)]
*  by people who are opposed to it [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5378.98s)]
*  is as if the money is just leaving America and going there. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5380.98s)]
*  And it is being funneled through American companies. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5384.5s)]
*  It still could look like, what is it called, [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5388.06s)]
*  like a money something scheme? [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5391.54s)]
*  A pyramid scheme? [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5394.62s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if it's a policy scheme [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5395.74s)]
*  or a pyramid scheme, but it's one of those situations [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5397.54s)]
*  where it's basically like they're laundering money, [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5399.3s)]
*  they're using Ukraine to launder money to themselves. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5402.1s)]
*  But that would be the case [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5405.22s)]
*  if real weapons weren't going there, [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5407.74s)]
*  but real weapons are going there. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5409.26s)]
*  And it takes real humans to make those real weapons, [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5410.5s)]
*  and it takes real materials to make the real weapons. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5412.58s)]
*  I guess I might be pro-war Ukraine. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5415.34s)]
*  No, I don't know, again, I don't know. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5417.1s)]
*  This is one of those things where we should talk [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5418.74s)]
*  to like a Vivek, you talk to like a Robert Kennedy Jr. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5420.2s)]
*  So what do we got here? [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5423.32s)]
*  So you got 4% is gonna be, I mean, out of 75 billion, [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5424.5599999999995s)]
*  4% is like humanitarian, emergency food, [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5428.12s)]
*  refugee support, et cetera. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5430.639999999999s)]
*  Financial, this is economic support, funds, loans, [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5432.16s)]
*  and then security. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5435.68s)]
*  So that is a big, well, can we go up? [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5436.5199999999995s)]
*  That is a big percentage, 35% is economic support, [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5437.8s)]
*  but it's economic support, funds, loans, [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5440.24s)]
*  and other financial support. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5442.72s)]
*  If it's a loan, you're gonna owe me that money [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5443.639999999999s)]
*  with interest. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5445.599999999999s)]
*  Well, here's the thing about that, [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5446.44s)]
*  which is very interesting. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5447.5599999999995s)]
*  I saw this clip, I think it was RFK talking about it, [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5448.4s)]
*  but he'd be really good to talk about this thing. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5450.2s)]
*  So in order to support Ukraine in this war, [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5452.2s)]
*  what I think Ukraine had to do is relinquish their rights [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5459.96s)]
*  to their natural resources. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5463.679999999999s)]
*  One of those resources being all these grain fields. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5466.16s)]
*  I think they call Ukraine like the breadbasket of Europe. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5470.36s)]
*  I think they provide more grain to the world [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5473.24s)]
*  than any other country, [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5475.12s)]
*  the greatest grain producer in all of Europe. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5476.44s)]
*  So they provide food, [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5478.32s)]
*  and that's a really valuable fucking thing. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5480.08s)]
*  If you have eight billion people on the planet, [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5482.04s)]
*  there's a lot of mouths to feed. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5484.96s)]
*  You need places that can grow a lot of food, [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5486.04s)]
*  and Ukraine is one of them. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5487.639999999999s)]
*  So they would have to relinquish, [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5490.4s)]
*  I think they've already relinquished 30% [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5491.719999999999s)]
*  of the rights to that, [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5493.5199999999995s)]
*  and I think they would have to relinquish all of it, [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5494.5599999999995s)]
*  because we're gonna have to go, by we, [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5497.599999999999s)]
*  I think BlackRock has to go rebuild, [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5500.719999999999s)]
*  I think they were given the right to rebuild Ukraine [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5503.32s)]
*  once the war is over, right? [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5505.84s)]
*  Now, I like giving the right. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5508.4800000000005s)]
*  It wasn't a responsibility. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5510.8s)]
*  It's the opportunity. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5511.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5512.96s)]
*  Right, and how are they gonna pay for that? [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5513.8s)]
*  They're gonna pay for that, [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5515.04s)]
*  but giving up the rights to their grain, [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5515.88s)]
*  giving up the rights to basic. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5518.16s)]
*  Which they can't pay for, which we know they can't. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5519.0s)]
*  Which we know they can't pay for, [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5520.32s)]
*  because how would they fucking pay for it? [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5521.4800000000005s)]
*  So that's the other thing. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5522.52s)]
*  It's like, in the most evil way of looking at this, [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5524.6s)]
*  do we push them into a war [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5528.360000000001s)]
*  we know that they cannot win without our support, [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5532.2s)]
*  hinder them with tons of debt, [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5536.28s)]
*  and then the only way that they can get out of this debt [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5538.12s)]
*  is to relinquish the only natural resources that they have [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5541.16s)]
*  that would present them [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5545.360000000001s)]
*  with any economic viability in the future, [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5546.24s)]
*  and now we own the bread, by we, BlackRock, [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5548.92s)]
*  or whatever it is, owns the breadbasket of Europe. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5551.6s)]
*  And controls food supply. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5554.76s)]
*  The alternative is you give up those lands to Russia before. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5556.64s)]
*  Exactly, so basically, Ukraine's like, [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5560.72s)]
*  okay, do we give it up to America, [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5562.16s)]
*  or do we give it to Russia? [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5563.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5564.52s)]
*  Maintain sovereignty and. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5565.5s)]
*  And then hope this gets forgiven at some point, [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5567.34s)]
*  we can get the rights back. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5569.1s)]
*  Yeah, no, I'm not saying that they necessarily [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5570.900000000001s)]
*  made the worst decision, but like, it is, [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5572.54s)]
*  I think Americans are kind of uninformed myself. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5574.860000000001s)]
*  I know 2% of what's really going on over here, [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5577.22s)]
*  but even with what I learned recently, [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5580.82s)]
*  oh, okay, so the money isn't really going over there. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5582.54s)]
*  There are people potentially benefiting from here. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5585.18s)]
*  Maybe too many wealthy companies are benefiting [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5587.26s)]
*  than average Americans, [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5589.38s)]
*  but those companies need to be serviced [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5590.82s)]
*  by average Americans. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5592.42s)]
*  So maybe it's beneficial to us, [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5593.74s)]
*  who knows, that's the trickle down thing you're saying. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5595.1s)]
*  And then also long term, like, [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5596.780000000001s)]
*  is America getting all them resources? [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5599.42s)]
*  I mean, it seems like BlackRock is getting a lot of them, [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5601.700000000001s)]
*  which is, again, not the best, [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5603.46s)]
*  but it's not draining from America. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5605.5s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of politicians [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5607.700000000001s)]
*  making money on it too. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5608.54s)]
*  I'm sure. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5609.38s)]
*  Like you see. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5610.200000000001s)]
*  BlackRock, the world won the rights somehow. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5611.04s)]
*  Go, go, go, go, go, go. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5613.1s)]
*  Politicians that are like buying stock [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5613.9400000000005s)]
*  in like Lockheed or Raytheon or whatever. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5615.5s)]
*  Yeah, I mean this is. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5618.34s)]
*  Like days before then the contracts go through. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5619.18s)]
*  Speak on this, this is actually great. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5621.42s)]
*  There's just like a bunch of like known politicians [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5623.02s)]
*  that are basically just like, [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5625.86s)]
*  as like days before it's announced [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5626.82s)]
*  that these things are going through, [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5629.179999999999s)]
*  where like they're getting these billion dollar contracts [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5630.379999999999s)]
*  through these military industrial companies. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5632.0199999999995s)]
*  They're buying huge amounts of their stock portfolio [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5633.74s)]
*  into these things. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5636.379999999999s)]
*  So there's like, and this is basically, [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5637.219999999999s)]
*  I'm working on a piece for this. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5638.74s)]
*  We'll put it out one of these days, [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5639.799999999999s)]
*  but like how politicians get rich. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5641.0s)]
*  And like one of the ways that they get rich [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5642.94s)]
*  is that they essentially do insider trading. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5645.16s)]
*  You know, they're privy to, [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5647.58s)]
*  they're on these different committees, [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5648.58s)]
*  so they're privy to information about like government deals [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5650.0199999999995s)]
*  that are gonna go through. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5652.54s)]
*  And oftentimes those government deals [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5653.78s)]
*  are using private entities, right? [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5655.139999999999s)]
*  So if you know that a massive deal is gonna go through, [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5657.16s)]
*  if the government is gonna commit [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5659.74s)]
*  to deploy $100 million towards Microsoft [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5661.44s)]
*  or something like that, [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5664.26s)]
*  well you can buy Microsoft the day before, [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5665.179999999999s)]
*  and now you get all those gains. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5668.139999999999s)]
*  And that's how a Nancy Pelosi, thanks, [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5669.38s)]
*  can like, you know, or her husband [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5671.58s)]
*  can beat the stock market. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5673.38s)]
*  So a lot of them know that we're gonna be putting [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5674.5599999999995s)]
*  these big aid packages together, [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5676.74s)]
*  and they're gonna put some money [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5678.42s)]
*  in that defense sector for sure. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5679.62s)]
*  And it doesn't just happen like that. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5681.38s)]
*  What happens with, if you're gonna put fuckin' [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5682.78s)]
*  speeding cameras on every single light post in America, [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5687.54s)]
*  there might be one company that the federal government [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5691.38s)]
*  gives the right to do it. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5693.719999999999s)]
*  Well guess who's heavily invested in that company? [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5695.179999999999s)]
*  The senator that is the one pushing that bill through. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5697.74s)]
*  And the tricky thing about it is like, [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5701.219999999999s)]
*  it's so blatantly obvious how these politicians make money, [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5703.86s)]
*  and it's kind of fucked up, [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5707.42s)]
*  because when we do it as like Samaritans, [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5708.82s)]
*  we go to jail for it. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5710.9s)]
*  Martha Stewart is in jail for less than Nancy Pelosi [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5712.42s)]
*  has done, 100% guaranteed. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5714.46s)]
*  So it is fucked up in that regard. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5717.4s)]
*  But here's the thing, like, [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5719.82s)]
*  and this is gonna sound unethical as hell, [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5721.14s)]
*  don't get me wrong. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5724.9400000000005s)]
*  And I think that we're in the worst case scenario, [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5725.78s)]
*  but like, if we don't let politicians [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5727.9800000000005s)]
*  leverage their power to make money, [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5732.14s)]
*  will we ever get the smartest people [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5735.26s)]
*  to be in those positions of power? [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5739.38s)]
*  Now, we're in the worst case scenario [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5743.34s)]
*  where we have idiots that are making the money. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5744.82s)]
*  But you want the brilliant people [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5747.7s)]
*  to be in those positions of power, [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5753.1s)]
*  and the way you incentivize most people is by money. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5755.18s)]
*  It's like, our smart people now [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5757.34s)]
*  are fucking working at hedge funds [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5758.74s)]
*  instead of making, I don't know, rockets, [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5760.26s)]
*  or they're definitely not making like policy. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5764.1s)]
*  Yeah, but they have the ability now to make money, [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5766.46s)]
*  and we still don't have the smartest people, [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5769.02s)]
*  so we might as well take away that advantage. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5770.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5773.04s)]
*  Yeah, or somehow compensate them more [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5774.24s)]
*  to where they're making decisions based off of [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5776.24s)]
*  what's in the best interest of the people [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5778.099999999999s)]
*  in their constituency and not for themselves. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5779.5599999999995s)]
*  You have the ability to make money, you're going to do it. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5781.4s)]
*  So now it's like, oh, I'm going to, [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5784.719999999999s)]
*  instead of doing what's best for the people, [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5786.839999999999s)]
*  I'm going to try to push this thing [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5788.04s)]
*  that's gonna help me the most. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5789.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, dude, it's so, [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5790.959999999999s)]
*  all this stuff is like, [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5793.86s)]
*  I feel like especially when it's around election time, [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5795.759999999999s)]
*  the truth to all these issues is way more boring [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5799.36s)]
*  than the headlines will make it seem. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5804.599999999999s)]
*  And I was even looking up this immigration thing, [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5806.679999999999s)]
*  because never in my life has immigration [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5809.32s)]
*  been an issue in New York, like illegal immigration. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5811.48s)]
*  Have you seen a lot of this popping up in the headlines? [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5814.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, the migrant workers [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5815.679999999999s)]
*  beat up the cop or whatever. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5817.36s)]
*  Yeah, but this was, in your life, [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5818.44s)]
*  do you remember this ever being in New York? [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5820.92s)]
*  There was one time I forgot what started, [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5822.5199999999995s)]
*  but I remember when MS-13. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5824.62s)]
*  Yeah, in Long Island, yeah, you're right. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5826.599999999999s)]
*  That was becoming an issue, [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5828.599999999999s)]
*  and then there were motherfuckers just knocking down doors [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5829.44s)]
*  and what's the ICE, ICE, sorry, [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5832.72s)]
*  and they're just going. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5835.12s)]
*  ICE, yeah, yeah, no, you're right. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5835.96s)]
*  I was hearing stories where they would just [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5839.36s)]
*  go to people's houses, take everybody out, ship them back. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5840.72s)]
*  And that was more of a gang thing [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5844.04s)]
*  that was indicative of, I guess, [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5846.2s)]
*  immigrants coming from a place. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5849.94s)]
*  But it was started as a gang problem. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5851.32s)]
*  And now, it's like there's an immigration issue [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5853.88s)]
*  where they're overwhelming our systems for people [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5857.88s)]
*  in New York, and I'm like, what is going on? [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5861.360000000001s)]
*  Why are there so many? [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5862.92s)]
*  The southern states that usually had to deal [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5863.76s)]
*  with the majority of that, they're like, [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5867.24s)]
*  yo, fuck this, I'm gonna put them on a plane, [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5868.68s)]
*  I'm gonna put them on a bus, and I'm just sending them to. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5870.52s)]
*  I looked that up, they did send some, [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5872.52s)]
*  but it's not to the point, which is an issue for sure, [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5874.64s)]
*  but it's not to the point where it would overwhelm our system [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5877.76s)]
*  in the way it has been overwhelmed. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5881.32s)]
*  And I looked into it, and this is why, [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5884.8s)]
*  America's a really interesting country. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5886.84s)]
*  I didn't realize this. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5888.2s)]
*  We are like an asylum-seeking country, [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5889.04s)]
*  meaning if you're going through some sort of political issue [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5891.04s)]
*  in your country or any sort of issue [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5895.24s)]
*  that's putting your life on the line, [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5897.04s)]
*  you can seek asylum in America, and we'll take you in. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5898.24s)]
*  We have an open-door policy. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5900.64s)]
*  We have sanctuary laws and stuff like that [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5901.76s)]
*  where it's like we have to provide you. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5903.56s)]
*  You can even sneak in. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5904.88s)]
*  There are people sneaking into America, idiots. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5906.2s)]
*  Walk in and say, hey, I'm seeking asylum, [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5909.0s)]
*  and then they'll look into your case, [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5911.08s)]
*  and that could take up to a year, two years. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5912.66s)]
*  And then in the meantime, you can't legally work. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5915.18s)]
*  It takes about six months to get a visa, [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5917.58s)]
*  but they basically be like, all right, [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5919.3s)]
*  well, when we get up to your case, you'll be good, [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5920.5s)]
*  so you can kind of kick it. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5921.94s)]
*  So then never go back and see your case. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5923.26s)]
*  You either live illegally by sneaking in [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5925.139999999999s)]
*  or live illegally by coming in. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5927.54s)]
*  By asylum. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5929.46s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, to me, it's just a no-brainer. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5930.3s)]
*  Anyway. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5932.26s)]
*  Yeah, sorry. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5934.82s)]
*  New York. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5936.18s)]
*  But they have to, the reason why they have to sneak in [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5937.82s)]
*  is because it's hard to get on a flight. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5939.58s)]
*  If you don't have the correct paperwork. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5943.34s)]
*  I'm saying walk across the border. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5944.9s)]
*  This is happening a lot. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5946.18s)]
*  But that's sneaking. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5947.02s)]
*  No, no, there's, you can go to border ports. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5947.84s)]
*  In TJ? [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5950.02s)]
*  Yeah, you just walk straight across. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5950.86s)]
*  There's plenty of them. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5952.06s)]
*  And then a lot of people do it in this way. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5952.88s)]
*  And again, I didn't know that either, [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5954.66s)]
*  because everybody, every Mexican dude that I worked with [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5956.9s)]
*  had told me their story of crossing the border [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5959.34s)]
*  when I work in restaurants. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5961.58s)]
*  It's like these amazing, amazing, [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5962.42s)]
*  that should be the podcast, but they don't speak English. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5964.78s)]
*  Their stories are unbelievable. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5968.06s)]
*  I met a dude who crossed, [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5970.06s)]
*  nobody was there to pick him up. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5971.2s)]
*  And he walked back. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5973.34s)]
*  Holy fuck. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5974.18s)]
*  Because he's like, I don't speak, [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5975.0s)]
*  I don't know anybody here, I don't have a cell phone. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5975.84s)]
*  I was supposed to meet a family member, [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5977.9400000000005s)]
*  I don't know where I am. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5979.86s)]
*  The only thing I do know is that Mexico's right there. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5981.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5983.54s)]
*  And that's the only place I feel safe. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5984.38s)]
*  Like think about it. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5985.66s)]
*  It's wild. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5986.5s)]
*  I talked to a guy on my pod that was working with a cartel [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5987.34s)]
*  to like smuggle people through the border of checkpoints. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5988.96s)]
*  Yeah, coyotes, yeah. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5990.86s)]
*  But he was going through the checkpoints. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5991.9s)]
*  So like, so the actual place, [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5993.18s)]
*  like he lived in TJ, went to school in America. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5994.86s)]
*  So every morning at six in the morning, [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5996.86s)]
*  he would cross the border, go to school, [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=5998.42s)]
*  and then go back. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6000.3s)]
*  Wow. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6001.38s)]
*  That was his life. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6002.58s)]
*  That's nuts. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6003.42s)]
*  It was insane. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6004.26s)]
*  And then he started getting in with a cartel [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6005.08s)]
*  and like sneaking people through the checkpoints [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6005.92s)]
*  with the border patrol. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6008.18s)]
*  And they would look at like fake documents [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6009.02s)]
*  and be like, all right, go. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6010.38s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6011.62s)]
*  I mean, it's just these incredible stories. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6012.4400000000005s)]
*  My boy did it, he did it just with a family. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6014.400000000001s)]
*  His family gave him to another family, [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6017.900000000001s)]
*  and he's a Nicaraguan kid, Ed Mundo, [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6020.76s)]
*  and he has blue eyes or green eyes. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6024.14s)]
*  So they just gave him to a white family. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6026.78s)]
*  And the white family just brought him across. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6028.5s)]
*  And they just had to hope he didn't cry. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6030.34s)]
*  This is fucking insane shit, right? [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6034.58s)]
*  Like every one of these stories. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6036.860000000001s)]
*  I smuggled my mom over the border, bro. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6038.7s)]
*  Exactly, you're not worried about it. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6040.58s)]
*  We got border pressure. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6041.78s)]
*  Anyway, New York, the only big city in the country [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6042.82s)]
*  that has a right to shelter policy. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6046.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6049.74s)]
*  This is very important. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6051.02s)]
*  This policy was developed for our homeless. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6053.7s)]
*  This is a liberal city. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6057.9800000000005s)]
*  We wanna make sure that everybody's taken care of. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6059.04s)]
*  It's got more money than any city in the world. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6060.64s)]
*  We can't have homeless people on the streets [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6062.24s)]
*  that don't have a place to live. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6063.68s)]
*  Also, homelessness is not a permanent thing [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6064.84s)]
*  in a lot of ways. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6067.4s)]
*  I think we see homelessness like our local homeless guy. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6068.24s)]
*  He's always homeless. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6069.9s)]
*  People cycle in and out of homelessness. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6070.8s)]
*  So basically what happens is that there is this system [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6072.96s)]
*  that we have that have shelters all around the city, [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6077.92s)]
*  and then people have that right. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6080.12s)]
*  If they are from this, we deploy money, [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6082.24s)]
*  and we make sure that they have a right to shelter. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6084.8s)]
*  If you are here and you are homeless, [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6087.08s)]
*  we will get you a place to stay. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6088.32s)]
*  That is a New York policy. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6089.44s)]
*  The only big city in the country that has it. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6090.5599999999995s)]
*  There are people that are seeking asylum, [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6093.639999999999s)]
*  or there are people who are coming here illegally [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6095.5599999999995s)]
*  that are taking advantage of that right [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6097.5599999999995s)]
*  to shelter policy. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6099.5599999999995s)]
*  It's not for illegal immigrants. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6100.44s)]
*  It's for New Yorkers and people who live here [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6102.0199999999995s)]
*  that are going through tough times, [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6105.04s)]
*  and they become homeless. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6106.599999999999s)]
*  So basically what happens is when they have [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6107.88s)]
*  a free fucking heroin district in San Francisco [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6110.48s)]
*  or Vancouver or one of these super liberal cities [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6114.0s)]
*  that like their way of making sure nobody spreads AIDS [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6116.12s)]
*  is by giving you the heroin or giving you the needles. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6119.72s)]
*  If you're a junkie, you go, oh, they're giving free shit? [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6122.36s)]
*  Let's do it. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6125.36s)]
*  Instead of struggling on the border here in Texas, [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6126.28s)]
*  let's try to find a way to get up to New York. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6128.84s)]
*  They're gonna put us up in a Roosevelt Hotel [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6130.76s)]
*  right across from Madison Square Garden [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6132.4s)]
*  for a few months, we're living good. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6134.16s)]
*  So we basically, they're basically taking advantage [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6136.84s)]
*  of a policy that wasn't for them, [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6139.92s)]
*  and now they're incentivized to come here. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6141.64s)]
*  And then when you add the politicians into it, [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6144.36s)]
*  they're all, like Mayor Adams is a shrewd politician. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6147.96s)]
*  He's using it to get more funds from the federal government [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6150.599999999999s)]
*  and from his state government. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6154.48s)]
*  He's like, look what's happening. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6156.2s)]
*  What's going on over here? [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6157.5199999999995s)]
*  I can't have a new recruiting class for the police. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6158.759999999999s)]
*  The library's gotta close. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6160.84s)]
*  All these things have gotta close. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6161.96s)]
*  He gets more money. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6163.599999999999s)]
*  He's like, yeah, I guess we don't need to close those. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6164.42s)]
*  But that's what politicians are supposed to do. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6167.04s)]
*  And then on the border, they're trying to pass a bill [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6169.24s)]
*  when there's issue with their ability to pass this bill. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6172.52s)]
*  But one of the crazy things that's happening on the border [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6175.72s)]
*  is the Republicans, you could make the argument, [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6177.400000000001s)]
*  do not want a bill to get passed [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6183.4800000000005s)]
*  because they want Trump to be able to use the border [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6186.160000000001s)]
*  as an issue for the election. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6189.88s)]
*  Well, they did want it. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6192.52s)]
*  They got, they asked for it. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6195.0s)]
*  They put up a fight against another bill. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6196.240000000001s)]
*  They got what they wanted, and then Trump said, [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6199.240000000001s)]
*  go against what you wanted. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6201.12s)]
*  But for that same reason. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6203.16s)]
*  Right. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6204.36s)]
*  So now there's some gray area here as well [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6205.18s)]
*  because both sides have different philosophies [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6208.48s)]
*  about how you stop this issue. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6210.36s)]
*  I think the Democrats are a little bit more like, [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6211.82s)]
*  why don't we make it one, easier to just shut down [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6214.96s)]
*  the border, like stop people from even seeking asylum. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6217.5599999999995s)]
*  Like Biden wants that apparently. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6219.72s)]
*  I think Biden's also like kicked out way more people [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6221.92s)]
*  than Trump ever did percentage wise, [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6223.96s)]
*  but way more people are coming over. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6227.86s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm wondering. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6229.16s)]
*  There's a lot of like weird stuff. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6230.52s)]
*  Basically, there's a lot of gray, [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6232.08s)]
*  but the headlines seem crazy. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6233.28s)]
*  Black and white, yeah. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6235.24s)]
*  Exactly, but philosophically, [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6236.08s)]
*  there's different issues on the border. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6237.8s)]
*  Like the Dems are a little bit more like, [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6238.92s)]
*  hey, why don't we get them their ability to work quicker? [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6240.28s)]
*  So at least if they're here, [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6243.52s)]
*  they're not working illegally, they're working legally. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6244.52s)]
*  And of course, conservatives go, [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6246.64s)]
*  well, now you're having all these extra people here [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6248.96s)]
*  that could potentially be taking jobs. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6251.76s)]
*  You're not looking out for Americans [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6253.88s)]
*  who are looking for jobs. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6255.24s)]
*  Like, and both of them are right about that. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6257.0s)]
*  Those are two fair sides. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6259.0s)]
*  To your old joke though, [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6260.72s)]
*  I don't think they're taking jobs that, [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6262.4s)]
*  they're not like stealing jobs that we're like really wanting. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6264.92s)]
*  That's the argument that a lot of people make up. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6267.16s)]
*  And then there's part of me that like hesitates to, [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6269.6s)]
*  to like, to support it, [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6272.6s)]
*  because I don't know the situation of some dude [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6275.2s)]
*  that like doesn't have an education [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6277.72s)]
*  and maybe that's the only thing he can do. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6278.96s)]
*  Like American Diner. Yeah, I guess I'm just basing it, [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6281.12s)]
*  and maybe it was stimulus related, [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6282.72s)]
*  but like, do you remember after COVID ended, [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6284.0s)]
*  restaurants were still staying closed? [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6285.92s)]
*  We don't have staff. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6288.12s)]
*  A Mexican would be staffed. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6289.44s)]
*  An illegal will be staffed. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6291.76s)]
*  You will not be understaffed [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6293.04s)]
*  if there's enough illegal Mexicans in particular. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6294.24s)]
*  I promise they'll work. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6296.28s)]
*  I don't think I've ever met an unemployed Mexican [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6298.76s)]
*  in my life, not that I think about it. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6300.24s)]
*  Got four jobs. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6301.88s)]
*  Yeah, met a lot of unemployed everything else. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6302.72s)]
*  They want people to come steal their jobs. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6305.08s)]
*  They're like, I have too many jobs. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6306.5199999999995s)]
*  I got seven. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6307.84s)]
*  I'll donate you two jobs if you want them. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6308.68s)]
*  So wait, why do the Dems care now though about this issue? [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6311.16s)]
*  It seems like only in the past like, couple months. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6313.44s)]
*  Which one, the border? [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6315.12s)]
*  Yeah, the border specifically. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6316.04s)]
*  Obviously, conservatives have been [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6317.4s)]
*  on the border thing forever. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6318.44s)]
*  Well, the argument that like an Elon Musk has put out, [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6320.0s)]
*  because he basically was like, [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6322.24s)]
*  oh, it's Biden and the Democrats goal [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6323.08s)]
*  is to keep the borders as open as possible [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6326.44s)]
*  so that those people can then become Democrats [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6329.68s)]
*  and they'll maintain a majority. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6331.84s)]
*  And while there's some logic to support what he's saying, [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6334.04s)]
*  it's kind of a manipulative take, I think, [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6339.0s)]
*  because like, one, it takes a while [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6341.96s)]
*  to get citizenship to vote. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6343.6s)]
*  So it's not like they come over and it's like, [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6345.36s)]
*  oh, here, you can vote in the election. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6347.04s)]
*  So maybe their kids would vote or maybe they do, [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6348.719999999999s)]
*  but that's not in this election. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6351.0s)]
*  It's gonna take a year to see all their cases. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6352.599999999999s)]
*  But even once you get your asylum, [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6355.599999999999s)]
*  it doesn't mean you get citizenship to vote. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6357.28s)]
*  So it's not exactly. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6359.4s)]
*  It takes years to get citizenship. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6360.759999999999s)]
*  So like, I don't think it's a fair argument, but. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6362.92s)]
*  He's been here for 30 years. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6365.96s)]
*  But that was on her. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6367.44s)]
*  That's citizenship. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6368.28s)]
*  But like, it's like, yeah, I feel like, I don't know. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6369.36s)]
*  I feel like the, so you're saying [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6374.44s)]
*  why the Dems upset at it? [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6376.4s)]
*  Yeah, like only now is it just because [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6377.679999999999s)]
*  it's affecting liberal cities that they care? [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6379.44s)]
*  Oh, by care, you mean like Mayor Adams. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6381.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I've just seen it. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6385.32s)]
*  Mayor Adams is not a Democrat. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6386.16s)]
*  He's the chief of police. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6387.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6389.4s)]
*  What we call a New York Democrat. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6390.24s)]
*  I feel like I've just seen it more in the forefront [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6391.2s)]
*  of Democrat politicians talking about it now, [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6392.759999999999s)]
*  whereas before, I feel like it was just ignored. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6395.839999999999s)]
*  So I'm curious if it's just because it's affecting New York [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6397.88s)]
*  or if there's something that's happening, [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6399.839999999999s)]
*  is there an inflection point [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6401.599999999999s)]
*  where border politics are changing, [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6402.8s)]
*  where things are getting more aggressive at the border? [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6404.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6406.52s)]
*  I mean, this is a total like coastal elite thing, [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6407.360000000001s)]
*  which is like, you know, not in my backyard [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6409.0s)]
*  or whatever like that. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6411.04s)]
*  Yeah, NIMBYism. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6411.88s)]
*  The NIMBY shit was completely, [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6412.72s)]
*  now that illegal immigrants are potentially [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6414.64s)]
*  interrupting affairs here in New York, [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6419.04s)]
*  all of a sudden New Yorkers are like, [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6421.68s)]
*  we gotta do something about the border. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6422.96s)]
*  Where before it was like, oh, be kind to that. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6425.28s)]
*  What are you, a racist? [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6428.400000000001s)]
*  Why do you not want these people in? [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6429.24s)]
*  So I think there is some of that, for sure. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6430.56s)]
*  And then you see headlines where it's like, [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6433.68s)]
*  oh, Eric Adams is gonna give every migrant [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6435.080000000001s)]
*  like a credit card for, what was it, like 10,000? [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6437.4400000000005s)]
*  I think a total of 53 million total [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6440.92s)]
*  was gonna be given to them. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6443.88s)]
*  And then everybody poor here in the state is like, [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6444.88s)]
*  the fuck, give us money. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6447.6s)]
*  That's valid. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6449.4800000000005s)]
*  So it's like, it's very. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6450.320000000001s)]
*  There's another one of those stimulus things [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6452.96s)]
*  where it's like, remember to keep the economy going, [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6454.68s)]
*  they gave the stimulus? [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6457.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6458.320000000001s)]
*  Giving the illegal immigrants here money to spend here. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6459.48s)]
*  If they give them a card, maybe this is why they do it. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6465.639999999999s)]
*  They're fucking smart. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6468.08s)]
*  If they give them a card, they can't take the money [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6469.12s)]
*  and send it back to where they're from. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6472.12s)]
*  They have to spend it here. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6474.76s)]
*  If they work jobs that they make cash, [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6478.0s)]
*  they could essentially take the money out of the economy [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6481.8s)]
*  and often do it and then send it back home. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6485.48s)]
*  As they should. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6487.28s)]
*  So maybe it's a way of maintaining the liquidity [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6488.5199999999995s)]
*  in the city where the asylum seekers are. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6492.2s)]
*  Maybe, I don't know. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6495.799999999999s)]
*  We need a guy who's way smarter about economics [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6496.719999999999s)]
*  and fiscal policy to figure that shit out. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6500.36s)]
*  But it seems to me like a lot of these things [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6503.36s)]
*  are boiling down to the same issue. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6505.099999999999s)]
*  Hey, we need some money to be spent? [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6506.5199999999995s)]
*  All right, let's get, what is it? [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6509.219999999999s)]
*  Let's create aid packages that aren't really going [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6511.679999999999s)]
*  to the average person. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6515.639999999999s)]
*  It was quick to give us all money [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6516.68s)]
*  when the economy needed a little boost. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6517.96s)]
*  That's very interesting. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6521.88s)]
*  So do you think this affects the election directly? [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6523.4800000000005s)]
*  Do you think it gets resolved by election time? [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6526.280000000001s)]
*  No, I think it will be a talking point. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6527.88s)]
*  I think they always do this, it's immigration, [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6529.72s)]
*  abortion will pop up. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6531.72s)]
*  Abortion is really the last thing Democrats have to stand on [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6534.04s)]
*  in terms of public perception, I think. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6536.52s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6538.84s)]
*  I think the reason they did much better [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6539.68s)]
*  than everyone thought in the midterms [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6541.56s)]
*  was the constitutional ruling about abortion. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6543.08s)]
*  I think a lot of people were more motivated to vote [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6547.12s)]
*  because they were like, oh, we need to codify [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6548.36s)]
*  Roe versus Wade or whatever, this is fucked up, [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6550.799999999999s)]
*  why would we let this happen? [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6552.759999999999s)]
*  We gotta go vote. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6554.08s)]
*  That's really the only PR thing the Democrats [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6555.4s)]
*  have to hang onto is they took away your right [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6558.08s)]
*  to have an abortion, your right to choose, blah, blah, blah. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6560.36s)]
*  They damn near need another abortion ruling [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6562.48s)]
*  if they, I think if they wanna do well at 2024. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6565.639999999999s)]
*  But the economy's kinda heading back in a good path. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6568.32s)]
*  Like inflation is still high, but at least the economy, [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6573.24s)]
*  job numbers are better. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6575.5199999999995s)]
*  Trump is seeing this, he's like, yo, he can't have wins. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6577.839999999999s)]
*  He can't have wins coming close to the election. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6581.24s)]
*  That's the thing that conservatives probably [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6583.879999999999s)]
*  don't wanna admit and everybody with a brain [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6586.2s)]
*  doesn't wanna admit, which is like, [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6589.879999999999s)]
*  country's doing pretty good under Biden. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6593.32s)]
*  It is doing pretty good under, at least the economy, [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6596.08s)]
*  and I understand. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6599.32s)]
*  Shout out to the managerial class. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6600.16s)]
*  I was talking to someone about this, [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6602.04s)]
*  no, we ain't about this yesterday. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6603.679999999999s)]
*  We have this criticism for the managerial class, right? [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6606.16s)]
*  And we have this criticism for the military industrial [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6608.679999999999s)]
*  complex, et cetera. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6610.8s)]
*  But the discussion was like, fuck, [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6612.24s)]
*  what was the metaphor that he used? [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6615.84s)]
*  It was like, are we, we're the best economy in the world, [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6617.04s)]
*  we're the strongest economy in the world. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6621.32s)]
*  You see what's happening right now with China, [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6622.5599999999995s)]
*  their stock market is really struggling. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6624.16s)]
*  They might have to do a stimulus package to buy in. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6626.5199999999995s)]
*  Apparently, it's like they really cracked down [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6629.28s)]
*  on the tech billionaires. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6631.12s)]
*  They basically didn't let the Elon Musks [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6632.32s)]
*  and the Mark Zuckerbergs and the Jeff Bezos [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6634.24s)]
*  just run free like America did. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6637.2s)]
*  Let the billionaires play. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6639.5599999999995s)]
*  They took Jack Ma and they put him in a basement [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6640.4s)]
*  and they said, you're gonna be making fucking dumplings [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6642.32s)]
*  if you don't get your act together. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6644.24s)]
*  And then people got a little skittish [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6645.88s)]
*  about investing into tech sectors, I guess. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6648.28s)]
*  So they lost a little bit of that. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6651.0s)]
*  This is what Ben is telling me, right? [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6652.2s)]
*  And he's Japanese, so I believe him. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6653.48s)]
*  But like, and whereas America's like, [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6658.2s)]
*  we've come out of COVID, it's really well, [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6663.679999999999s)]
*  like way better than most countries. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6667.16s)]
*  Like we've gotten that inflation [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6669.84s)]
*  that was running the fuck away [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6671.2s)]
*  to a point where I feel like, [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6672.92s)]
*  it's not to say there aren't people suffering, [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6674.76s)]
*  it's not to say that they're, but comparative suffering. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6676.12s)]
*  Like, are eggs cheaper here than they are in Canada? [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6679.36s)]
*  Yes. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6682.84s)]
*  Are groceries cheaper here than they were [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6683.679999999999s)]
*  in England or Norway? [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6685.24s)]
*  Yes. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6687.36s)]
*  So you can't go, is it as good as it was before, [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6688.32s)]
*  because there was a catastrophic event that happened. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6692.32s)]
*  You have to compare what's going on [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6694.28s)]
*  to what other people or other countries are doing. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6696.12s)]
*  And if we're doing better, [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6698.679999999999s)]
*  do we fucking pat on the back the managerial class? [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6700.48s)]
*  Like, do we pat Janet Yellen or whoever that woman is [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6703.28s)]
*  who runs the money and be like, [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6706.92s)]
*  yo, keep running the money good. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6708.48s)]
*  Like, are we bitching about, [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6709.92s)]
*  I think the metaphor he uses is like playing time? [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6712.28s)]
*  Like we're on the championship team, [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6715.599999999999s)]
*  but we're like, yo, I need more minutes, coach. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6717.759999999999s)]
*  All right, guys, you see the blue lights. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6720.64s)]
*  You know what that means. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6722.360000000001s)]
*  It means this is your daily reminder [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6723.4800000000005s)]
*  that your dick game sucks. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6725.360000000001s)]
*  And you know, I don't mean it sucks in a good way with dicks. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6727.52s)]
*  I mean, your shit is trash, probably. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6730.240000000001s)]
*  At least mine is. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6732.160000000001s)]
*  And if yours is, we could be friends on that. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6733.200000000001s)]
*  But you know what we could also do? [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6735.160000000001s)]
*  Improve the dick game, get a little better. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6736.6s)]
*  Even if your dick game is good, [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6738.240000000001s)]
*  you probably think it is and it's probably not, [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6739.52s)]
*  it could be better. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6741.280000000001s)]
*  That's why you need Blue Chew. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6742.160000000001s)]
*  It's got the same active ingredients [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6743.400000000001s)]

*  It's fantastic. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6774.0s)]
*  Guys, improve your sex life. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6775.16s)]
*  Why would you not do this? [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6777.32s)]
*  Let's get back to the show. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6778.24s)]
*  All right, guys, we're gonna take a break real quick [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6779.28s)]
*  because I need to tell you your bank sucks. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6780.96s)]
*  How do I know this? [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6783.639999999999s)]
*  Because pretty much all banks suck, so I'm probably right. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6784.48s)]
*  And that's why you need Current. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6786.96s)]
*  Current actually helps you build your credit, [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6788.8s)]
*  get your paychecks faster, [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6791.36s)]
*  and gives you a great interest rate on your savings. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6792.84s)]
*  Let's start with this thing right here. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6795.24s)]
*  This is called the Build Card from Current. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6796.719999999999s)]
*  And here's why it's great. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6799.2s)]
*  It's a secured credit card [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6800.599999999999s)]
*  that lets you use your own money to build up your credit. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6802.0s)]
*  What that means is it functions kind of like a debit card. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6804.96s)]
*  You buy shit using your own money, [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6807.92s)]
*  not the credit card companies. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6809.6s)]
*  But where a normal debit card [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6811.14s)]
*  doesn't have any effect on your credit score, [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6813.24s)]
*  the Build Card reports all of your purchases [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6815.26s)]
*  to credit companies, [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6817.52s)]
*  so it actually helps you build your credit, [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6818.52s)]
*  improve your credit score, [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6820.64s)]
*  and more importantly, there's no credit check [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6822.32s)]
*  or history required to get this card. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6824.4s)]
*  So if you're looking to improve your credit score, [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6826.36s)]
*  this is the card for you. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6828.32s)]
*  I know people who use it and love it, and you will too. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6829.72s)]
*  On top of all that, [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6832.4s)]
*  when you switch to Current and set up a direct deposit, [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6833.8s)]
*  you can get paid up to two days faster. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6835.76s)]
*  Guys, it's your money. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6837.88s)]
*  You worked hard for it, now get it faster. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6838.84s)]
*  And maybe most importantly, [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6840.400000000001s)]
*  you can get up to a 4% interest rate [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6842.14s)]
*  on your savings with Current. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6844.24s)]
*  Guys, how much more of a no-brainer can we make this? [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6845.12s)]
*  So guys, what are you waiting for? [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6847.6s)]
*  Get Current, the future of banking. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6848.96s)]
*  Go to current.com slash flagrant or download the app. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6850.8s)]
*  That is current.com, C-U-R-R-E-N-T dot com slash flagrant. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6854.32s)]
*  Terms apply. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6859.72s)]
*  Current is a financial technology company, not a bank. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6860.56s)]
*  Banking services provided by Choice Financial Group, [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6862.4800000000005s)]
*  member FDIC, and Co-Observer Bank, member FDIC, [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6863.72s)]
*  for full terms and conditions in the current.com [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6865.88s)]
*  or call 888-851-1172 for more information. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6867.88s)]
*  Let's get back to the show. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6871.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's tricky. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6872.900000000001s)]
*  I was thinking about this with even the Putin interview. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6873.74s)]
*  I was like, if you're the managerial class, [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6875.400000000001s)]
*  do you have an obligation to control the flow of information? [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6878.8s)]
*  Because obviously the free speech absolutist, [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6881.96s)]
*  and even myself included to an extent, [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6883.6s)]
*  I'm like, no, we should be able to hear [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6886.0s)]
*  what other national leaders are saying, [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6887.56s)]
*  but we're the only major superpower [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6889.88s)]
*  that basically is able to do that. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6891.88s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6893.56s)]
*  I don't think Chinese media is gonna be broadcasting [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6894.4s)]
*  any president, any US president's idea [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6898.12s)]
*  of what American imperialism is, [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6900.2s)]
*  or any Russian dictator, vice versa. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6901.759999999999s)]
*  So I don't think. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6904.879999999999s)]
*  They do, they just dub it and then. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6905.719999999999s)]
*  Say whatever we want. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6907.839999999999s)]
*  They don't even need to dub Biden, probably. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6909.44s)]
*  They're like, nah, listen to this shit right here. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6910.839999999999s)]
*  But isn't that amazing? [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6912.679999999999s)]
*  Keep going, this is a great point. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6913.759999999999s)]
*  What an amazing thing. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6915.24s)]
*  So it's cool that we have that [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6916.36s)]
*  and we're able to get all the information, [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6917.5599999999995s)]
*  and we're able to hear what other countries, [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6919.12s)]
*  leaders are saying, but at the same time, [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6921.759999999999s)]
*  there are Americans that are getting swayed by it. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6923.52s)]
*  Is that against our interest if this guy is just lying? [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6925.68s)]
*  And if he's just talking out of his ass [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6928.96s)]
*  to gain sentiment, is that bad for us, [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6930.84s)]
*  and should we be controlling what information can get in? [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6933.6s)]
*  Because every other country does. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6935.72s)]
*  I'm sure the managerial class would be like, [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6936.64s)]
*  yes, we should, because these idiots, the people, [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6938.12s)]
*  don't know what's good for them, [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6941.56s)]
*  and we have to make sure that they're not getting information [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6942.64s)]
*  they're being manipulated by, [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6944.92s)]
*  which clearly was the goal of that interview. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6946.0s)]
*  The goal of that interview was to manipulate, [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6948.08s)]
*  based on truth or based on falsehoods, it doesn't matter. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6950.04s)]
*  The goal was to manipulate into a direction. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6954.72s)]
*  Fair enough. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6958.92s)]
*  But maybe it's on us to be intelligent enough [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6959.88s)]
*  to combat that information. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6965.42s)]
*  Which is the argument against having a managerial class. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6968.24s)]
*  It's on us to be intelligent enough to govern ourselves. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6970.64s)]
*  Oh, I meant the managerial class. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6972.68s)]
*  Instead of squashing that interview, [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6975.08s)]
*  you put out something saying why Tucker, [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6978.72s)]
*  or not saying why Tucker shouldn't have done it, [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6983.360000000001s)]
*  but saying why Putin was lying [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6984.92s)]
*  or not being completely truthful. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6987.0s)]
*  This is indicative of his weakness. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6988.4800000000005s)]
*  But that's why they're coming so hard at tech companies, [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6989.72s)]
*  because it'd be like, yo, [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6991.96s)]
*  y'all are letting all this misinformation in, [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6993.12s)]
*  making our kids stupid, you're swaying elections, [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6996.240000000001s)]
*  it's like you guys have a bigger responsibility [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=6998.92s)]
*  to not let this shit run. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7002.12s)]
*  I do subscribe to that idea, which is like, [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7003.76s)]
*  you bare minimum have a responsibility [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7006.62s)]
*  to tell us if information is true or false, [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7009.46s)]
*  or there maybe is another term [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7014.74s)]
*  for when it's completely opinion-based. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7016.98s)]
*  Subjective, I guess, or biased. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7020.34s)]
*  It could be biased. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7022.0199999999995s)]
*  Like if somebody's out there going, [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7022.86s)]
*  the Miami Dolphins are the greatest football team, [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7024.3s)]
*  we're like, we all know that that's just someone's opinion, [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7026.7s)]
*  but maybe there's a version of that. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7031.3s)]
*  But yeah, I do think that they should have [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7032.66s)]
*  the responsibility to at least inform, [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7034.06s)]
*  which they're doing now, I think. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7036.660000000001s)]
*  The free speech absolutists are just like, nah. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7037.900000000001s)]
*  Every, you should be able to say whatever the fuck you want. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7041.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but I mean, lying is just like, yeah, [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7043.14s)]
*  I think lying is its own thing, as information. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7045.02s)]
*  Yeah, especially when a smart person's lying [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7047.42s)]
*  and you can't discern what's true. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7049.02s)]
*  And like other countries are getting information, [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7051.02s)]
*  this is a funny story, a friend of mine works [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7052.540000000001s)]
*  with a bunch of different factories in China, [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7054.3s)]
*  and is doing clothing and shit. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7056.06s)]
*  And he'll get a text randomly, once a week, [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7057.46s)]
*  from this Chinese lady that he's in contact with, [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7059.9800000000005s)]
*  that'll just be like, are you okay, all caps? [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7064.68s)]
*  And he'll be like, yeah, what's up? [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7066.52s)]
*  And then she'll be like, oh my goodness, [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7068.4400000000005s)]
*  I was so worried about you. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7070.860000000001s)]
*  And then we'll send a link to a train [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7071.82s)]
*  that got derailed in Portland. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7073.56s)]
*  And he'll be like, what? [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7075.400000000001s)]
*  And she's like, yeah, this is big news here, [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7077.0s)]
*  things don't seem good over there, hope you're okay. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7078.4400000000005s)]
*  And he's like, what is going on? [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7081.04s)]
*  And basically, when some bad shit happens here, [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7083.04s)]
*  I was actually talking to Des Bishop, [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7085.56s)]
*  he says that Chinese media will do this, [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7086.72s)]
*  where the opening thing will be like, [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7088.18s)]
*  here's why China's amazing, [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7089.84s)]
*  that's like segment one on the news. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7091.04s)]
*  Segment two is here's why the West is falling apart. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7092.64s)]
*  And then segment three will be some shit [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7095.0s)]
*  about like Gigi Pang or something, I can't remember. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7096.320000000001s)]
*  But there's always a segment about like, [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7098.160000000001s)]
*  all right, here's why America's getting fucked up. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7099.780000000001s)]
*  And they just control it. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7102.76s)]
*  To make the point I was arguing with earlier, [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7104.0s)]
*  free speech absolutists would be like, [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7106.280000000001s)]
*  that's why you need both sides, [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7107.68s)]
*  so you know what's coming from every angle. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7109.6s)]
*  And then you should be smart enough [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7111.160000000001s)]
*  to discern what's true and what's not. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7112.68s)]
*  I just, I don't know, it seems like if there's, [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7114.120000000001s)]
*  if there's a blatant lie, a little disclaimer, [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7115.84s)]
*  this has been proven to not be true, would be nice. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7117.900000000001s)]
*  The only tricky thing with that system [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7119.8s)]
*  is who gets to decide what is true or false. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7121.96s)]
*  And we have to at least acknowledge [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7124.4800000000005s)]
*  that that's frustrating. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7125.76s)]
*  And I get why the free speech absolutists is concerned [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7127.24s)]
*  because they're like, yo, I could be saying something [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7129.88s)]
*  that we believe is true, we've researched it, it is true. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7132.22s)]
*  And then someone out of nowhere, [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7135.92s)]
*  who's part of the managerial class, [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7137.4s)]
*  that doesn't like my opinion or thinks in my opinion [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7138.9800000000005s)]
*  could bias people in a certain direction, [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7141.16s)]
*  could say it's false and then completely discredit [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7143.24s)]
*  what I say, that's too much power to give them. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7144.96s)]
*  I get that argument too. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7147.04s)]
*  This is the problem of nation building. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7147.88s)]
*  Yo, this shit is tricky, bro. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7149.28s)]
*  People should be empathetic to the nation building [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7150.72s)]
*  and be like, yo, this shit is hard as fuck. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7152.4400000000005s)]
*  Maybe that, yeah, go, go, go. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7154.400000000001s)]
*  Because if you listen to Putin, you're like, [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7155.240000000001s)]
*  wait, did we blow up the Nord pipeline? [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7157.08s)]
*  We need SimCity but for geopolitics [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7159.0s)]
*  so people can really just get a sense of how hard that is. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7161.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7163.6s)]
*  I mean, yeah. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7164.4400000000005s)]
*  Who blew up the pipeline? [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7165.280000000001s)]
*  He's saying the CIA did it and there's probably, [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7166.4800000000005s)]
*  there's conclusive evidence or I guess, [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7169.56s)]
*  what do you call it, circumstantial evidence [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7171.92s)]
*  to say maybe, who could do it and who would want to. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7173.8s)]
*  I mean, there's probably a few countries [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7176.6s)]
*  on the planet that can do it. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7178.1s)]
*  That could. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7179.2s)]
*  And then you just have to line up the interests. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7180.48s)]
*  So it's like, yeah. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7182.64s)]
*  And then do we want to know that about ourselves? [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7184.04s)]
*  It's like, okay, we're getting true shit [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7185.599999999999s)]
*  and we're finding out about our fuck shit. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7186.88s)]
*  And then it's like, okay, as a major class, [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7188.72s)]
*  do you just propagandize your own country? [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7190.24s)]
*  And then all the people are like, no. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7191.92s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7193.92s)]
*  Nation building's fucking hard. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7194.76s)]
*  Which pill you want to take, my boy? [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7195.72s)]
*  Type shit. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7197.84s)]
*  Because that's really what it is and I genuinely believe. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7198.84s)]
*  And let's just, let's have an honest conversation [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7201.68s)]
*  with ourselves right now. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7203.5199999999995s)]
*  Blue pill. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7204.36s)]
*  Which one is the blue? [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7205.28s)]
*  That's the. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7206.2s)]
*  Yeah, the live in the false reality. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7207.68s)]
*  Live in the false reality. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7209.2s)]
*  Right? [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7210.04s)]
*  And it's like. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7210.88s)]
*  Red pill is when you hate bitches. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7211.96s)]
*  That's the, when you take that one, [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7213.5599999999995s)]
*  then you beat the shit out of your wife. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7215.72s)]
*  That's the one I would take. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7217.5599999999995s)]
*  So. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7218.72s)]
*  It really is the red, it's just misery, that red pill. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7219.5599999999995s)]
*  It really is. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7222.599999999999s)]
*  But the blue pill, you say you would take, [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7223.88s)]
*  because you've seen the movie. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7227.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7229.04s)]
*  So you don't have the curiosity about what the truth is [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7229.88s)]
*  and what it does to you, right? [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7232.639999999999s)]
*  Because I've thought about that as well. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7234.04s)]
*  It's like, after seeing the movie, you're like, [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7235.16s)]
*  I don't want to live in no fucking spaceship on the ground. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7236.32s)]
*  Food is fucking sludge. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7238.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, literally it's just the food. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7239.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7241.32s)]
*  That's the only, like, if the food was fire. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7242.16s)]
*  If they had P.F. Changs in that bitch, we'd be good. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7244.599999999999s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7246.719999999999s)]
*  Fucking giant hole in the back of your head. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7247.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7248.679999999999s)]

*  More similar. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7257.719999999999s)]
*  Seasoning at least. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7258.5599999999995s)]
*  Seasoning. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7259.4s)]
*  It might have been seasoned, I don't know. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7260.24s)]
*  That's y'all with the no seasoning. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7261.08s)]
*  That's fair, that's fair. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7262.4s)]
*  And the fits of fire when they're in the matrix. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7264.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7268.2s)]
*  I'm doing it for the clothes, bro. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7269.04s)]
*  They look good. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7270.4800000000005s)]
*  Is that easy? [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7271.320000000001s)]
*  You only look good when you in the blue pill world. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7272.16s)]
*  So it's like. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7275.76s)]
*  Blue pill beat. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7276.6s)]

*  but the only fun I ever have is when I'm in the blue pill [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7279.2s)]
*  and I could have just been in that world? [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7281.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7283.360000000001s)]
*  So. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7284.2s)]
*  It's rough. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7285.04s)]
*  So here's the question. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7285.860000000001s)]
*  Let's say we're doing okay. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7286.7s)]
*  Let's say you're doing okay, your family's okay, [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7288.72s)]
*  and things are going okay, right? [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7290.56s)]
*  Let's say we're blessed, things are going okay, right? [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7292.76s)]
*  Yeah, Mike. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7296.240000000001s)]
*  All right. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7297.08s)]
*  Things are going okay, we're blessed. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7299.24s)]
*  You have the curiosity of the red pill, right? [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7303.12s)]
*  Or in this circumstance, you have the curiosity [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7307.24s)]
*  of what would it be like if we didn't have [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7309.6s)]
*  a major class or what would it be like [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7311.32s)]
*  if we didn't have the military industrial complex [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7313.5599999999995s)]
*  or et cetera? [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7315.48s)]
*  But is it possible the people that are making [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7316.32s)]
*  those complaints are not satisfied enough with life? [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7320.6s)]
*  That they don't want to. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7328.08s)]
*  Yeah, their reality is not the best. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7330.28s)]
*  I imagine if your reality is good [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7333.2s)]
*  and you enjoy your reality, do you really wanna look into. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7336.0s)]
*  Why rock the boat? [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7339.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7340.64s)]
*  I think that that's the masses [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7341.48s)]
*  and I think maybe that's the. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7343.12s)]
*  What is it? [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7344.2s)]
*  You're just not happy people complaining at home on. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7345.04s)]
*  You're usually not. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7347.6s)]
*  Looking into conspiracies about whatever. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7348.44s)]
*  There's something that you need to understand. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7350.08s)]
*  And then, yeah, I don't know. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7352.12s)]
*  I look at that a little bit and I wonder [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7354.84s)]
*  if that is the, they talk about this all the time. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7357.16s)]
*  They keep us fighting against each other [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7360.8s)]
*  and that's why we never do anything. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7362.64s)]
*  It's like, I don't know if that's it. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7364.4800000000005s)]
*  I think what they do is the opiate that they give us [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7366.8s)]
*  is that incredible Super Bowl experience [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7370.16s)]
*  where the whole day is you and your friends, [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7373.88s)]
*  you're watching this amazing game [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7376.12s)]
*  and even the commercials are really good. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7377.52s)]
*  The opiate isn't constant racism and hatred. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7379.64s)]
*  The opiate is like. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7382.8s)]
*  We need both though. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7383.64s)]
*  You add a little racism, it gets hot. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7384.96s)]
*  Everybody likes drama. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7387.160000000001s)]
*  No, don't get me wrong, the drama's fire. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7388.280000000001s)]
*  But we still need Wreck League basketball that's awesome, [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7391.0s)]
*  that has a trophy at the end. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7393.8s)]
*  We still need a great TV show to watch. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7395.08s)]
*  The opiate, to make our lives fun and enjoy, [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7397.4400000000005s)]
*  it's not that much. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7400.52s)]
*  Like, do you know what I mean? [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7402.280000000001s)]
*  It's all blue pill stuff. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7403.12s)]
*  Yeah, so I wonder if that's it. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7404.360000000001s)]
*  It's like maybe life and there's tons of people [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7408.4800000000005s)]
*  who don't have this privilege, [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7411.200000000001s)]
*  but for the people who are living good lives [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7412.72s)]
*  and their families are safe, [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7415.08s)]
*  how much do they really want the Fed taken down? [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7416.400000000001s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7420.400000000001s)]
*  Like, I watch one Fed thing. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7421.240000000001s)]
*  You know me, I'm prisoner of the moment. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7422.12s)]
*  So the last thing I watch, that's how I feel. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7423.200000000001s)]
*  So I'm like, we gotta take down the Fed. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7424.96s)]
*  I don't think in that moment, like, [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7427.04s)]
*  shit, the Fed's been doing all right for me. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7428.84s)]
*  It's only 3%. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7431.280000000001s)]
*  Inflation, it's only 3%. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7433.68s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7436.92s)]
*  Like, am I making sense or am I being like a complete. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7437.76s)]
*  I do think people kind of look at their lives [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7443.52s)]
*  and they think like the little things that are bugging them, [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7444.64s)]
*  they don't think how it could be worse. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7446.52s)]
*  They just think like, oh, it could be better. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7448.52s)]
*  Because they haven't seen the matrix. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7449.84s)]
*  They don't know what America looks like [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7452.320000000001s)]
*  when we take that pill. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7453.92s)]
*  Also, if you haven't left America, [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7455.200000000001s)]
*  you don't know how great America is economically. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7457.68s)]

*  I've seen levels of poverty leaving America [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7462.72s)]
*  that I'm like, this ain't anywhere in America. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7464.56s)]
*  This ain't anywhere in America. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7467.52s)]
*  We're gonna talk about the 1%. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7469.0s)]
*  Most Americans are the 1%. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7470.36s)]
*  You know, the world you're saying. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7472.5599999999995s)]
*  Wall Street, take down Wall Street, take down the 1%. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7473.639999999999s)]
*  If you are American, for a large percentage of America, [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7476.08s)]
*  you are in the 1% globally speaking. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7479.5599999999995s)]
*  So what do we do, man? [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7483.48s)]
*  Dio, you know what you want? [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7485.36s)]
*  You wanna be able to just like peek in. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7486.44s)]
*  Like, you wanna know like what happened with Epstein. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7488.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7491.679999999999s)]
*  This is what probably most, I don't know about most people, [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7492.5199999999995s)]
*  but this is what I think a lot of people want. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7494.5599999999995s)]
*  They wanna just know [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7497.04s)]

*  Well, it depends. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7510.32s)]

*  is everybody's being selfish. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7540.64s)]
*  The person who's living good, got their mortgage, [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7541.88s)]
*  their family's fucking great, they're like, [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7544.4s)]

*  that could seem absolutely pointless, [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7550.12s)]
*  but they're not saying stop it [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7552.36s)]

*  will it take that sacrifice to stop those people from dying? [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7559.52s)]

*  My sister in law is talking to me about a podcast [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7763.639999999999s)]
*  She's recommending it, she's like you should check it out [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7765.639999999999s)]

*  Didn't even think about it, I went to Spotify [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7771.639999999999s)]
*  I never would have done that pre-Rogan [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7773.639999999999s)]
*  Another podcast of an asshole army member told me about called The Knowledge Project [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7775.639999999999s)]
*  You gotta listen to this, listen to this episode [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7779.639999999999s)]
*  Shout out to you, I forgot your name, I'm sorry [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7781.92s)]
*  But I remember now, I looked it up on Spotify [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7783.92s)]
*  That's why you throw the crazy bag at Rogan [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7785.92s)]
*  Because they made Spotify the place to go to [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7787.92s)]
*  Yeah, you're paying for market share [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7789.92s)]
*  You're paying for market share and he did it [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7791.92s)]
*  It would have been Apple Podcasts before that right? [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7793.92s)]
*  It would absolutely have been Apple Podcasts [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7795.92s)]
*  I don't even go to the podcast app [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7797.92s)]
*  Where podcasts were created, I don't even go to that [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7799.92s)]
*  I don't go to it, I used to go to apple [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7801.92s)]
*  I had one called Overcast that I would go to [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7803.92s)]
*  I had like all these different apps, I would never go to Spotify [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7805.92s)]
*  I don't even listen to music on apple no more [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7807.92s)]
*  That's how crazy it is [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7810.2s)]
*  To me, I listen to music still on apple [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7812.2s)]
*  And then I would listen to pods on Spotify [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7814.2s)]
*  And now it's shifted my music consumption [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7816.2s)]
*  So they're making money off of not just podcasts [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7818.2s)]
*  They're making money [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7820.2s)]
*  Like you said, it's not just his podcast [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7822.2s)]
*  It's everybody who listens to podcasts [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7824.2s)]
*  On Spotify [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7826.2s)]
*  And that's not just, I'm sure the same thing [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7828.2s)]
*  Oh, Alex Cooper's doing the same thing for girls [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7830.2s)]
*  But not to that same level [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7832.2s)]
*  And they kept Rogan for a reason [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7834.2s)]
*  I thought they signed her too [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7836.2s)]
*  I thought they let that go [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7838.48s)]
*  I think Rogan's number one, Alex Cooper's number two [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7840.48s)]
*  In terms of all the deals they signed panning out [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7842.48s)]
*  Rogan dissed at number one [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7844.48s)]
*  And then I give Alex Cooper her credit, she's a beast [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7846.48s)]
*  But Rogan is the reason [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7848.48s)]
*  Any dude is listening to podcasts on Spotify [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7850.48s)]
*  I gotta ask Rogan how he got the bag [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7852.48s)]
*  I don't know if it's [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7854.48s)]
*  I mean it seems like it's bigger than the first bag [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7856.48s)]
*  Plus he got the freedom to put it wherever [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7858.48s)]
*  From what I've read, Spotify's like [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7860.48s)]
*  I think, again, they're not dumb, dude [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7862.48s)]
*  I think they threw the bag at the top [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7864.48s)]
*  I think they threw the bag at Rogan to be exclusive [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7866.759999999999s)]
*  Because they knew [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7868.759999999999s)]
*  Changing behavior is the single hardest thing to do [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7870.759999999999s)]
*  Changing behavior of someone instinctively going to Apple Podcasts to Spotify [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7872.759999999999s)]
*  I need you to be exclusive [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7878.759999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna throw a crazy bag at you [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7880.759999999999s)]
*  And now they're like we don't need exclusivity anymore [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7882.759999999999s)]
*  Because we won [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7884.759999999999s)]
*  The war is over, now let's just do a revenue share on ads [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7886.759999999999s)]
*  And the best way to get revenue share on ads [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7888.759999999999s)]
*  Is let them have it everywhere [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7890.759999999999s)]
*  Oh [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7892.759999999999s)]
*  I don't know if that's how it's structured [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7895.04s)]
*  So it's worth 250 million dollars to get a percentage of Rogan's ads [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7897.04s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7899.04s)]
*  Yeah [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7901.04s)]
*  Oh, I didn't know that, that makes sense [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7903.04s)]
*  Yeah, they're getting the percentage of the ads [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7905.04s)]
*  I also figured there was another angle where it's like [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7907.04s)]
*  You've gotten the market share [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7909.04s)]
*  But you also know how he can move market share [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7911.04s)]
*  So you have to pay him to not leave [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7913.04s)]
*  To not leave [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7915.04s)]
*  Because he could easily just be like, I'm not putting it on Spotify anymore [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7917.04s)]
*  I'll go exclusive to Apple [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7919.04s)]
*  Or I won't put it on Spotify, he don't even have to go exclusive somewhere else [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7921.04s)]
*  Everyone else but Spotify [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7923.32s)]
*  I'm sure that factors in too [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7925.32s)]
*  This guy moves the fucking landscape of entertainment [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7927.32s)]
*  So you just have to [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7929.32s)]
*  It is what it is [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7931.32s)]
*  But I also think they aren't going to do exclusive deals anymore [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7933.32s)]
*  They're like we'll still do it [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7935.32s)]
*  Well they got the market share [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7937.32s)]
*  The whole idea with the deals is to get people to consume podcast [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7939.32s)]
*  On the Spotify app [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7941.32s)]
*  Or Spotify platform [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7943.32s)]
*  It's like you've achieved it, you don't have to spend any more money [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7945.32s)]
*  And I think that's why they slash so many people in that department [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7947.32s)]
*  It's like it's been done [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7949.32s)]
*  We've got all the people [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7951.599999999999s)]
*  I think people might even miss how hard that was [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7953.599999999999s)]
*  Because at least even for me I feel like I was on the edge of it [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7955.599999999999s)]
*  Had I not been involved in podcasting at the time [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7957.599999999999s)]
*  I don't even know if I would have noticed [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7959.599999999999s)]
*  But all audio was consumed on YouTube and Apple [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7961.599999999999s)]
*  Going from all the way back to iTunes days [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7963.599999999999s)]
*  And they just held that lineage all the way up [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7965.599999999999s)]
*  And do you know what's crazy? [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7967.599999999999s)]
*  Before the Rogan deal, they were handing out other deals [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7969.599999999999s)]
*  I think before [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7971.599999999999s)]
*  Other podcasts that I would listen to on my other apps [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7973.599999999999s)]
*  When they went exclusive to Spotify, I stopped listening [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7975.599999999999s)]
*  Spotify became my primary app [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7977.599999999999s)]
*  Spotify became my primary app [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7979.88s)]
*  And I just fell out of it with that podcast [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7981.88s)]
*  And I don't even want to make anybody feel bad or whatever [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7983.88s)]
*  So no names, but don't even think about them anymore [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7985.88s)]
*  Rogan got me to switch my entire behavioral habits [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7987.88s)]
*  Keep listening to that [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7989.88s)]
*  It's like a fucking crazy thing [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7991.88s)]
*  Huge risk, but it paid off massively [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7993.88s)]
*  That's awesome [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7995.88s)]
*  I mean, shouts, dude, that's insane [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7997.88s)]
*  I also think they learned that the Spotify exclusive pods weren't working [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=7999.88s)]
*  Especially if they don't come in with a built-in audience [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8003.88s)]
*  Like they launched so many [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8005.88s)]
*  Spotify originals [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8008.16s)]
*  Big names thinking that it will come [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8010.16s)]
*  And it's like, nah, they have to have the built-in audience [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8012.16s)]
*  We have to trust you [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8014.16s)]
*  You also had to overpay [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8016.16s)]
*  I think they did this knowing [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8018.16s)]
*  We're going to overpay, we're going to lose on a lot of these guys [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8020.16s)]
*  Like Russ was talking about with the advances you give [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8022.16s)]
*  Four of these won't pan out, one of them will [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8024.16s)]
*  Four of these podcast deals won't pan out [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8026.16s)]
*  One of them happened to be Rogan [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8028.16s)]
*  And the guy moves fucking mountains [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8030.16s)]
*  We got the right guy [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8032.16s)]
*  It's weird, it's like podcasting isn't like [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8034.16s)]
*  Podcasting isn't like [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8036.44s)]
*  Going to see someone at a nightclub [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8038.44s)]
*  Where like, if the person's famous enough [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8040.44s)]
*  Even though they got nothing to do with dancing or DJing [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8042.44s)]
*  You might just show up [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8044.44s)]
*  You know, you're going to be like, oh shit [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8046.44s)]
*  Fucking Jay-Z's going to be hanging out at 11 in Vegas [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8048.44s)]
*  For the Super Bowl after party [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8050.44s)]
*  I'll go watch Jay-Z 100% [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8052.44s)]
*  Podcasting is like, you got to specifically want to enjoy listening to those people [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8054.44s)]
*  So that's why I knew Charlemagne with the Brilliant Aids [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8056.44s)]
*  I knew it was going to kill [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8058.44s)]
*  Because people were all over the place [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8060.44s)]
*  And I knew that they were going to be like, [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8062.44s)]
*  I knew it was going to kill [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8064.719999999999s)]
*  Because people were already in a listening pattern with Charlemagne [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8066.719999999999s)]
*  But if random actor [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8068.719999999999s)]
*  Just starts a podcast [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8070.719999999999s)]
*  It might work, it might not [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8072.719999999999s)]
*  Smartless ended up working [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8074.719999999999s)]
*  Those three guys were great, and there's three of them, right? [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8076.719999999999s)]
*  Those three guys were great, they ended up killing [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8078.719999999999s)]
*  How many famous people have started podcasts [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8080.719999999999s)]
*  That no one gives a flying fuck about [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8082.719999999999s)]
*  It also takes time, and you got to be committed to it [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8084.719999999999s)]
*  Even like Dax, like Dax Shepard shows [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8086.719999999999s)]
*  One of my favorites, but he's been doing it for [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8088.719999999999s)]
*  Five years, six years, seven years? [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8090.719999999999s)]
*  It's an overnight success because we all found out about it late [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8093.0s)]
*  But [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8095.0s)]
*  He's already independently wealthy, successful actor, producer, whatever [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8097.0s)]
*  Like married to literally frozen [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8099.0s)]
*  And [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8101.0s)]
*  Just doubles down and works super hard [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8103.0s)]
*  On this one pod [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8105.0s)]
*  For dumb long, before he gets the bag from Spotify [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8107.0s)]
*  Is he going to keep doing it with Spotify? [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8109.0s)]
*  I don't know, I don't think they're not exclusive anymore [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8111.0s)]
*  I don't think [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8113.0s)]
*  But yeah, I think they cut a lot of their exclusivity deals [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8115.0s)]
*  Because they're like, hey I think we got market share, let's go [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8117.0s)]
*  Let's go blow the show up [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8119.0s)]
*  And now you see the guys who they made money [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8121.28s)]
*  Who the deal was like, this was the winner [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8123.28s)]
*  It's him and maybe Alex Cooper [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8125.28s)]
*  That's the other thing to think about [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8127.28s)]
*  When you take a deal like that [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8129.28s)]
*  Like if you take a deal that could [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8131.28s)]
*  Significantly [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8133.28s)]
*  With Rogan, he was great enough [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8135.28s)]
*  Where it didn't reduce his market share [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8137.28s)]
*  His show probably just grew [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8139.28s)]
*  And he had to bust his ass to do that shit [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8141.28s)]
*  He didn't over let up [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8143.28s)]
*  He could have gone three a week probably [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8145.28s)]
*  And did totally fine [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8147.28s)]
*  He could have gone four a week, five a week [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8149.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't even think he gets enough credit for that [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8151.5599999999995s)]
*  He went behind a paywall pretty much [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8153.5599999999995s)]
*  And the show grew [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8155.5599999999995s)]
*  Can you imagine going exclusively to Patreon [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8157.5599999999995s)]
*  And then your numbers go up overall? [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8159.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, kept the work ethic [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8161.5599999999995s)]
*  Unreal, but [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8163.5599999999995s)]
*  Fuck, what was I just saying [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8165.5599999999995s)]
*  What brought us to that? [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8167.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh, that's why you got to be careful [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8169.5599999999995s)]
*  When you take a bag for an exclusivity thing [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8171.5599999999995s)]
*  You better hold on to that [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8173.5599999999995s)]
*  Because you're not going to be able to [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8175.5599999999995s)]
*  You better hope that that bag [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8177.84s)]
*  Is all the money you're going to make [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8179.84s)]
*  For the rest of your time podcasting [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8181.84s)]
*  Sustainable [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8183.84s)]
*  Because what you're potentially doing [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8185.84s)]
*  Is significantly decreasing [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8187.84s)]
*  Your audience size [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8189.84s)]
*  For a two year window [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8191.84s)]
*  You don't know if that audience is going to be there [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8193.84s)]
*  When you come back to the open market [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8195.84s)]
*  And you don't know if the podcast company is going to [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8197.84s)]
*  Resign you because they might have gotten your market share [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8199.84s)]
*  Right? [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8201.84s)]
*  I remember Netflix had this strategy [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8203.84s)]
*  Where they would add an extra season [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8206.12s)]
*  On to popular shows [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8208.12s)]
*  So there was a popular show called [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8210.12s)]
*  The Killing on AMC [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8212.12s)]
*  And Netflix was like, we're going to do an extra season on Netflix [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8214.12s)]
*  It was a great way to grab market share [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8216.12s)]
*  There was all these fans of this show [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8218.12s)]
*  And they weren't necessarily the biggest shows [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8220.12s)]
*  But they were devout viewership [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8222.12s)]
*  And they would do an extra season on Netflix [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8224.12s)]
*  So this is early on, you're like, I'll buy Netflix to watch my favorite show [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8226.12s)]
*  The rest of Development did the same thing [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8228.12s)]
*  They did with the rest of Development as well [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8230.12s)]
*  And they're never doing another season after that [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8232.12s)]
*  Because they don't have to, they got you [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8234.400000000001s)]
*  They got you in the door [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8236.400000000001s)]
*  They gave you the little taste, whatever it was [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8238.400000000001s)]
*  Once you get the $10.99 on your monthly bill [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8240.400000000001s)]
*  And you see all the other shit that's on Netflix [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8242.400000000001s)]
*  Good to go [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8244.400000000001s)]
*  So I think that there were some people that saw the bag [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8246.400000000001s)]
*  And they were like, wow [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8248.400000000001s)]
*  All that money, that's fucking crazy [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8250.400000000001s)]
*  I'm definitely going to do that [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8252.400000000001s)]
*  But they might not have realized that that was the last [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8254.400000000001s)]
*  Bag that they're going to get [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8256.400000000001s)]
*  And this is where we'll see if they're good enough [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8258.400000000001s)]
*  To continue to build [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8260.400000000001s)]

*  Did you see, just to add on to that [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8373.52s)]
*  I also added audiobooks to all [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8375.800000000001s)]
*  Premium memberships [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8377.800000000001s)]

*  You can also listen to like 150,000 books [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8385.800000000001s)]

*  So that's what it seems like the next acquisition [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8393.800000000001s)]
*  They had a couple different audiobooks on there before [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8395.800000000001s)]
*  I think those were like independent [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8397.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the acquisition they're doing is crazy [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8399.800000000001s)]
*  They're trying to be the audiobook, anything that you listen to [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8401.800000000001s)]
*  I'll be honest, Audible is a pain in the fucking ass [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8404.08s)]
*  Bro, why is this so hard? [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8406.08s)]
*  I quit, I bought 23 credits, I didn't know how to access them [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8408.08s)]
*  You can't get more, you can only buy so many books a month [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8410.08s)]
*  Why can't I not just buy a book when I want to buy a fucking book? [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8414.08s)]
*  Because they don't want to lose money to Apple [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8416.08s)]
*  So you buy the token and then you buy the book [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8418.08s)]
*  But it's their way around Apple [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8420.08s)]
*  Because if you're buying things through the Apple store [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8422.08s)]
*  Apple gets that piece [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8424.08s)]

*  Because they give you all those credits [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8434.36s)]
*  But then if you try to cancel, you lose all the credits [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8436.36s)]
*  So it's like, it forces you to cut [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8438.36s)]
*  It's like, damn, I have like 10 credits in here [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8440.36s)]
*  If I cancel, I lose them all [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8442.36s)]
*  So I'ma just hold on to this [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8444.36s)]
*  It's good fast money, it's a one top blick [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8446.36s)]

*  Man [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8450.36s)]
*  I'm canceling, I ain't using these credits [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8452.36s)]
*  Ease of Ag, once Spotify comes in and just offers me books [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8454.36s)]
*  And I realize, oh shit, I like audiobooks [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8456.36s)]
*  And if they got the reading component as well [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8458.36s)]

*  Oh, dude, Mark, reincarnation [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8541.2s)]
*  Yeah, you didn't know this, he watched some TV shows [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8543.2s)]
*  He watched a lot of past lives and kids who remember their past lives [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8545.480000000001s)]
*  And it really affected him to the point that he's like texting Miles [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8547.480000000001s)]
*  Like, Miles, I need you to watch this [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8549.480000000001s)]
*  And Miles is skeptical, he's like, I need you to watch this and tell me why it's bullshit [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8551.480000000001s)]
*  Because if Mark has to believe in reincarnation, what is his life? [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8553.480000000001s)]
*  What is all these years of Catholicism? [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8555.480000000001s)]
*  I mean, he does believe in [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8557.480000000001s)]
*  I mean, Catholicism is the greatest example of reincarnation [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8559.480000000001s)]
*  Jesus dies and comes back [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8561.480000000001s)]
*  And only Jesus dies and comes back [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8563.480000000001s)]
*  Well, you didn't say that reincarnation applies to everybody [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8565.480000000001s)]
*  Apparently it does [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8567.480000000001s)]
*  Oh, does it? [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8569.480000000001s)]
*  I don't know if it applies to everybody, it applies to these six kids [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8571.480000000001s)]
*  That's six Jesuses [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8573.76s)]
*  That's more Jesusi than Catholicism [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8575.76s)]
*  I don't know, these kids knew some shit, I don't know how they knew it, bro [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8577.76s)]
*  There is a possibility that I'm like, I don't know, are the parents kind of like feeding it? [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8579.76s)]
*  What do they know? [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8585.76s)]
*  This motherfucker believes everything [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8587.76s)]
*  It's crazy, bro [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8589.76s)]
*  Is there anything you don't believe in? [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8591.76s)]
*  Why don't you watch and see what you think? [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8593.76s)]
*  Miles seeing his past lives? [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8595.76s)]
*  Mine I don't know, it's tricky [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8597.76s)]
*  But that's my question, there was an influence, there was someone talking about it [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8599.76s)]
*  In their past lives, what were they saying? [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8602.04s)]
*  The names of ships that they claimed to have been on in World War II [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8604.04s)]
*  And the names of people that they were friends with on the ship [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8606.04s)]
*  How did they know they were ships? [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8608.04s)]
*  Because there was a five year old kid who was on a big boat [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8610.04s)]
*  I had an airplane, they shot me [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8612.04s)]
*  Who shot you? [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8614.04s)]
*  The people with the red flag, the red dot [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8616.04s)]
*  I mean, they could have watched any movie where a plane was shot [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8618.04s)]
*  Why don't you guys watch the thing? [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8620.04s)]
*  I don't know, that's my point, that's why I'm skeptical in general [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8622.04s)]
*  I'm going to watch it, but it's time [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8624.04s)]
*  The other one [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8626.04s)]
*  Watch it on 1.2 [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8628.04s)]
*  The other one? [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8630.320000000002s)]
*  Watch it on 1.25 [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8632.320000000002s)]
*  What was the other one where it was an actor or something? [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8634.320000000002s)]
*  The Hollywood guy? [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8636.320000000002s)]
*  The Hollywood guy where he was like [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8638.320000000002s)]
*  Apparently none of this information was public on the internet [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8640.320000000002s)]
*  But he was like, look, this Hollywood guy, I used to be him [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8642.320000000002s)]
*  And that was my friend, and he was a cowboy [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8644.320000000002s)]
*  And I had this color car [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8646.320000000002s)]
*  And apparently the super niche details weren't on there [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8648.320000000002s)]
*  And they verified it with the family [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8650.320000000002s)]
*  He knew his death certificate was wrong? [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8652.320000000002s)]
*  He knew his death certificate was wrong [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8654.320000000002s)]
*  He said, when did you die? [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8656.320000000002s)]
*  He was 61, they were like, actually you were 59 [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8658.6s)]
*  And then they checked the death certificate, he was actually 61 [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8660.6s)]
*  The family had it wrong [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8662.6s)]
*  It's little things like that, where you're just like, what is happening? [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8664.6s)]
*  Can memory be passed down through DNA? [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8666.6s)]
*  It depends if you believe in epigenetics, yeah [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8668.6s)]
*  Like epigenetic research is based on can you inherit [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8670.6s)]
*  Trauma or feelings that your ancestors might have inflicted [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8672.6s)]
*  That's not genetically encoded in them [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8674.6s)]
*  But something that they experience [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8676.6s)]
*  So it's that [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8678.6s)]
*  Done, I solved your stupid riddle [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8680.6s)]
*  No one in the family was involved [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8682.6s)]
*  What else can you solve? [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8684.6s)]
*  It doesn't need to be from the family [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8686.880000000001s)]
*  They could have just consumed that content [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8688.880000000001s)]
*  And that content is baked into them [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8690.880000000001s)]
*  And then passed through their genetic material [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8692.880000000001s)]
*  Maybe [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8694.880000000001s)]
*  I don't think, if you watched it it would still seem like [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8696.880000000001s)]
*  You're the one who watched it [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8698.880000000001s)]
*  I heard your whole breakdown, you did a whole 20 minute breakdown [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8700.880000000001s)]

*  What else did I get to do? [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8706.880000000001s)]
*  You converted me to not be a Catholic [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8708.880000000001s)]
*  I'm killing it [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8710.880000000001s)]
*  We can talk about Shane [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8712.880000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8715.16s)]
*  First of all, Bud Light bag huge [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8717.16s)]
*  The amount of promo that Bud Light has been getting [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8719.16s)]
*  From Shane already [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8721.16s)]
*  They owe him millions [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8723.16s)]
*  Just for drinking all those Bud Lights on [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8725.16s)]
*  Rogan every time they go on [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8727.16s)]
*  Every time they do the protected parks [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8729.16s)]
*  The fact that Bud Light has been getting that for free [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8731.16s)]
*  And they haven't called up Shane [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8733.16s)]
*  And been like, hey here's a million dollars [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8735.16s)]
*  Thank you so much [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8737.16s)]

*  Is drinking our beer because of you [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8741.16s)]
*  I'm bummed that he wasn't in the Super Bowl commercial [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8743.44s)]
*  Son, I was watching it, waiting for him to pop up [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8745.44s)]
*  They must have filmed that before the deal was signed [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8747.44s)]
*  Or something like that [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8749.44s)]
*  He would have blown up [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8751.44s)]
*  We had Post and Shane, it would have been crazy [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8753.44s)]
*  Miles had a great idea for a Super Bowl ad that Bud Light messed up [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8755.44s)]
*  Okay [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8757.44s)]
*  I think that they should have started with the [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8759.44s)]
*  Dilly Dilly opening that was popular [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8761.44s)]
*  6-7 years ago for the whole controversy [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8763.44s)]
*  Same exact open [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8765.44s)]
*  And then when they go to the night in the all blue [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8767.44s)]
*  He peels his head off, peels the helmet off [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8769.44s)]
*  And then it's Shane Gillis, Gilly Gilly [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8771.720000000001s)]
*  Gilly Gilly [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8773.720000000001s)]
*  Gilly Gilly [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8775.720000000001s)]
*  And then him and Post [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8777.720000000001s)]
*  And everyone is just partying [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8779.720000000001s)]
*  Same commercial just on the second half [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8781.720000000001s)]
*  They could have easily put him in that fucking commercial [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8783.720000000001s)]
*  That's what kind of annoyed me about it [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8785.720000000001s)]
*  It must have been a timing thing [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8787.720000000001s)]
*  But they were at a place that had a stage already [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8789.720000000001s)]
*  So he could have been on stage [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8791.720000000001s)]
*  Or doing something [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8793.720000000001s)]
*  But the SNL thing [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8795.720000000001s)]
*  What a fucking win [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8797.720000000001s)]
*  What a win [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8800.0s)]
*  We were trying to think about other [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8802.0s)]
*  In entertainment, when does this happen? [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8804.0s)]
*  Chappelle getting the rights back to his show [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8806.0s)]
*  Norm got fired [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8808.0s)]
*  He kicked off SNL and comes back and hosts [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8810.0s)]
*  And has fired because that's one of Shane's [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8812.0s)]
*  Heroes [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8814.0s)]
*  No, it's sick because [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8816.0s)]
*  To get banished from the city [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8818.0s)]
*  And then return as king is always [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8820.0s)]
*  Biblical cool [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8822.0s)]
*  This is what all of us in our minds [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8824.0s)]
*  Are thinking when we're in the shower [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8826.0s)]
*  Replaying events, replaying things we would have said [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8828.28s)]
*  I'll show them [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8830.28s)]
*  He's going to get to show them [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8832.28s)]
*  And they're going to fucking knock it out of the park [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8834.28s)]
*  Is he going to have McKeever do a couple of sketches? [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8836.28s)]
*  He'd be so fired [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8838.28s)]
*  I would imagine that you would bring your guys [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8840.28s)]
*  I would imagine SNL if they're smart [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8842.28s)]
*  They're like, hey, you know how you make the best [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8844.28s)]
*  Sketches online? Why don't you do that for us? [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8846.28s)]
*  That'd be great [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8848.28s)]
*  He's got to do Trump [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8850.28s)]
*  No question [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8852.28s)]
*  I'm curious if he brings back other sketches [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8854.28s)]
*  If he brings back the guy Fieri guy [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8856.560000000001s)]
*  Like the PTSD dude [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8858.560000000001s)]
*  If he brings back some of those characters [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8860.560000000001s)]
*  I think it would be smart [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8862.560000000001s)]
*  If he has this show online already [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8864.560000000001s)]
*  Especially if we're familiar with them [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8866.560000000001s)]
*  Because it's less legwork [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8868.560000000001s)]
*  Of creating a new character [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8870.560000000001s)]
*  If the audience is not familiar with it [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8872.560000000001s)]
*  It'd be like, oh, this character is so funny [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8874.560000000001s)]
*  And you're like, yeah, have another sketch [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8876.560000000001s)]
*  I wonder if you can double dip like that [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8878.560000000001s)]
*  There's an interesting thing [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8880.560000000001s)]
*  There's some people that hit me up for comment on it [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8882.560000000001s)]
*  And they're like, doesn't this show that [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8884.84s)]
*  Cancel culture isn't real [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8886.84s)]
*  And yeah, it's like [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8888.84s)]
*  I already feel it kind of like [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8890.84s)]
*  Percolating a little bit [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8892.84s)]
*  I know that we had spoken about this a little bit [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8894.84s)]
*  But I don't like that angle [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8896.84s)]
*  Yes, I feel like cancel culture is different [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8898.84s)]
*  Than it used to be and I'm like annoyed [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8900.84s)]
*  Even as a comedian to talk about cancel culture [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8902.84s)]
*  Every time I get hit up by these fucking talk shows [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8904.84s)]
*  And they're like, would you like to come talk to us [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8906.84s)]
*  About cancel culture? The last thing I want to talk about [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8908.84s)]
*  Is cancel culture [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8910.84s)]
*  What I will say is I do think it's unfair [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8913.12s)]
*  To Shane [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8915.12s)]
*  If you're using this to go [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8917.12s)]
*  Cancel culture never existed [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8919.12s)]
*  Because [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8921.12s)]
*  You basically are removing [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8923.12s)]
*  His comeback [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8925.12s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like he was so determined [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8927.12s)]
*  And then he kept working [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8929.12s)]
*  That he was able to get the opportunity [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8931.12s)]
*  Despite being canceled [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8933.12s)]
*  When you go [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8935.12s)]
*  See, cancel culture never existed [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8937.12s)]
*  So then he never went through anything? [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8939.12s)]
*  Exactly [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8941.400000000001s)]
*  A guy is wrongfully in prison for 10 years and he gets out [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8943.400000000001s)]
*  The justice system works [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8945.400000000001s)]
*  I already know [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8947.400000000001s)]
*  That that's going to be a conversation [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8949.400000000001s)]
*  That kind of comes, they're going to use it to almost discredit it [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8951.400000000001s)]
*  But what he did [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8953.400000000001s)]
*  The internet hated this guy [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8955.400000000001s)]
*  They shit all over me [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8957.400000000001s)]
*  Even comedians were attacking another comedian [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8959.400000000001s)]
*  For jokes, trying to be funny [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8961.400000000001s)]
*  Team Z showing up at his shows [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8963.400000000001s)]

*  So I don't think [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8967.400000000001s)]
*  I don't think that's fair to him [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8969.68s)]
*  And I already know that that narrative [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8971.68s)]
*  Is kind of percolating a little bit [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8973.68s)]
*  And people don't even realize it [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8975.68s)]
*  Because I think a lot of times [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8977.68s)]
*  The articles are celebrating [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8979.68s)]
*  See, we're done with cancel culture [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8981.68s)]
*  Things are different, sure [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8983.68s)]
*  But don't discredit what the guy had to go through [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8985.68s)]
*  To get this opportunity [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8987.68s)]
*  And on the fringes there are some kind of talentless hacks [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8989.68s)]
*  For lack of a nicer way to say it [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8991.68s)]
*  Who mobilize cancel culture [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8993.68s)]
*  And act like they're getting canceled [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8995.68s)]
*  But, not even [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8997.960000000001s)]
*  Aside from all that shit the chain had to go through [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=8999.960000000001s)]
*  Imagine the internet calling you [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9001.960000000001s)]
*  And believing and thinking [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9003.960000000001s)]
*  This is a racist person [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9005.960000000001s)]
*  Like even that didn't know it's tough [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9007.960000000001s)]
*  Which they're right, look, you can be right [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9009.960000000001s)]
*  You can be right and wrong [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9011.960000000001s)]
*  But like, the whole internet's like this guy [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9013.960000000001s)]
*  I gave him the pass, I gave him the pass [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9015.960000000001s)]
*  Oh, he's been using it [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9017.960000000001s)]
*  But yeah, it's like that [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9019.960000000001s)]
*  You're even kind of marginalizing that [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9021.960000000001s)]
*  That's fucking miserable, man [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9023.960000000001s)]
*  I'm making some jokes that didn't land [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9026.24s)]
*  Okay, we all fail as comics [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9028.24s)]
*  Comics know that [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9030.24s)]
*  But now I'm just a racist for the rest of my life [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9032.24s)]
*  As far as I can tell conceivably [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9034.24s)]
*  Unless I flip it and he flipped it [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9036.24s)]
*  I really hope he does an Asian accent [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9038.24s)]
*  He gotta open on it [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9040.24s)]
*  That would be fucking life-changing [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9042.24s)]
*  RIDE FROM NEW YORK! [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9044.24s)]
*  I think that's Joe List made that comment [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9046.24s)]
*  On his IG when Shane announced [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9048.24s)]
*  He said ride from New York [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9050.24s)]
*  But how fire would that be if Shane was just like [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9052.24s)]
*  I mean, yeah, he's gotta do it [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9054.52s)]
*  I don't think he should shit on the show though [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9056.52s)]
*  I don't think he will [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9058.52s)]
*  I saw some people being like, oh, he's gonna get his revenge [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9060.52s)]
*  He's gonna call them all, like, he's gonna fucking put the swords around [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9062.52s)]
*  Son, you gotta give Lauren credit [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9064.52s)]
*  And remember Shane, after he got fired [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9066.52s)]
*  We had him on the pod early [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9068.52s)]
*  And he was like, dude, Lauren is the fucking man [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9070.52s)]
*  And Lauren was like trying to get him to keep his job [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9072.52s)]
*  He was like pitching it [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9074.52s)]
*  And I'm sure someone over Lauren was like, we can't do it [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9076.52s)]
*  But I think Lauren had to go to bed [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9078.52s)]
*  And be like, no, this kid needs to host [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9080.52s)]
*  So you gotta give Lauren his credit to give him his props [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9082.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's like [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9084.800000000001s)]
*  I think it's a cool moment [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9086.800000000001s)]
*  I wouldn't shit on the show [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9090.800000000001s)]
*  Because in a way [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9092.800000000001s)]
*  Him doing the show [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9094.800000000001s)]
*  I think [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9096.800000000001s)]
*  And it looks like he's passed this [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9098.800000000001s)]
*  And I think he's good no matter what [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9100.800000000001s)]
*  And obviously brands aren't concerned [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9102.800000000001s)]
*  But there is a moment after you get canceled [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9104.800000000001s)]
*  For something like racism [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9106.800000000001s)]
*  Where brands are scared to mess with you [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9108.800000000001s)]
*  And then you go have the successful Netflix specials [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9111.08s)]
*  And you have the Bud Light [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9113.08s)]
*  And now you're fine [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9115.08s)]
*  But going back on the show that canceled you [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9117.08s)]
*  Completely wipes the slate clean [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9119.08s)]
*  You could go do a Pixar movie now [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9121.08s)]
*  You could voice whatever [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9123.08s)]
*  And I think that [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9125.08s)]
*  I don't know if SNL is aware of it [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9127.08s)]
*  If they are aware that they're doing that [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9129.08s)]
*  That's cool [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9131.08s)]
*  And that's worth not shitting on [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9133.08s)]
*  It's basically, we fucked up [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9135.08s)]
*  And we fucked and kinda messed up your life [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9137.08s)]
*  And you had to work really hard to get where you're at [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9139.36s)]
*  And [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9141.36s)]
*  This benefits us by having you [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9143.36s)]
*  The super famous comedian on our pod [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9145.36s)]
*  On our show [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9147.36s)]
*  But at the same time we're gonna wipe the slate [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9149.36s)]
*  Because we fucked up [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9151.36s)]
*  This is them going yo we fucked up [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9153.36s)]
*  And we're gonna tell everyone hey we're good [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9155.36s)]
*  Because it's not like the things that they canceled him for [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9157.36s)]
*  Are still on the internet [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9159.36s)]
*  Right? [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9161.36s)]
*  That's why I think it's part of the reason why Bud Light [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9163.36s)]
*  Didn't put him in the question [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9165.36s)]
*  His slate might be completely clean yet [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9167.640000000001s)]
*  So it's like hey we're gonna [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9169.640000000001s)]
*  February 25th we got an ad locked and loaded [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9171.640000000001s)]
*  Son, I guarantee if SNL came out before the Super Bowl [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9173.640000000001s)]
*  He's in that condition [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9175.640000000001s)]
*  That's an interesting point [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9177.640000000001s)]
*  So yeah, yeah [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9179.640000000001s)]
*  It's gonna be [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9181.640000000001s)]
*  They did the thing with the trans person [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9183.640000000001s)]
*  And it's like that backfired on him so it's like [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9185.640000000001s)]
*  Hey let's just get a feeler [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9187.640000000001s)]
*  Let him announce it and see what people say about it [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9189.640000000001s)]
*  Yo the victory is killing [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9191.640000000001s)]
*  If he goes on there and kills [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9193.640000000001s)]
*  The whole ad, everybody watching would be like [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9195.92s)]
*  See y'all fucked up [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9197.92s)]
*  Y'all could have had this every week [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9199.92s)]
*  So that's the win, it's just killing [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9201.92s)]
*  Maybe there's a funny way to acknowledge it [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9203.92s)]
*  I don't know, I gotta hit him [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9205.92s)]
*  I truly don't remember the last time I was this excited for SNL [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9207.92s)]
*  That I'm like I wanna watch the premiere [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9209.92s)]
*  I wanna watch it live [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9211.92s)]
*  Maybe Chappelle [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9213.92s)]
*  Chappelle was crazy [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9215.92s)]
*  It is so dumb that you even still now have like [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9217.92s)]
*  News agencies and shit being like [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9219.92s)]
*  Oh here's the racist jokes that comedian St. Gilles says [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9221.92s)]
*  St. Gilles says they got him in [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9224.2s)]
*  And they run it right back [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9226.2s)]
*  How do you not understand this is helping [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9228.2s)]
*  Like if your goal is to try to hurt this guy's career [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9230.2s)]
*  You're doing the exact opposite [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9232.2s)]
*  They're probably just want some clicks [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9234.2s)]
*  They just want the clicks man [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9236.2s)]
*  If it works out for them great [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9238.2s)]
*  Shall we guys, is that the end of an episode? [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2qfbCvsKw&t=9240.2s)]
