*  let's start here, it was about to drop, you know, [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=3419.08s)]
*  in a month. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=3421.08s)]

*  Why didn't you put it on the album? [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=3438.7799999999997s)]

*  He's looking at the album as a piece of art. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=3453.48s)]
*  And if this doesn't match the art, [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=3455.48s)]
*  which is respectable, you're looking at as a businessman. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=3457.48s)]
*  And I get that. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=3459.48s)]

*  not making it. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=3474.48s)]
*  Every song on that album was made for that album. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=3475.48s)]

*  That's probably the reason. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=3970.88s)]
*  It's the same reason you don't drink alcohol or smoke weed. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=3971.88s)]

*  We do have a freedom. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4020.88s)]
*  Because you don't have the ego block as African American hip hop artists. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4021.88s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4028.88s)]

*  You're gonna get your ass gay. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4048.88s)]
*  I think that you have to, you know, establish some kind of dominance. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4049.88s)]
*  One way. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4054.88s)]
*  You feel you have to establish dominance. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4055.88s)]
*  If someone did that, after that I'd be like, go in the kitchen and make me a sandwich. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4056.88s)]

*  We never had a deep conversation. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4654.48s)]
*  Who is the person that you were the biggest fan of that you met and was the most impressive? [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4656.32s)]

*  And it could be any genre. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4662.44s)]
*  It's probably Drake. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4664.44s)]
*  Drake's the man. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4666.44s)]

*  How did you guys connect? [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4671.44s)]
*  I guess just like Instagram. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4675.679999999999s)]
*  Was he a fan of your music content? [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4677.679999999999s)]
*  I think he was a fan of my production. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4680.679999999999s)]

*  I don't know. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4688.679999999999s)]
*  You guys did a great pod. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4690.44s)]
*  That was a good episode. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4692.599999999999s)]
*  That was, right? [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4693.599999999999s)]
*  We almost made it a real thing. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4694.599999999999s)]
*  Dude, I thought it was going to be a regular thing. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4696.04s)]
*  I thought it would be recurring. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4698.599999999999s)]
*  We almost did. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4699.599999999999s)]
*  I thought it showed a side. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4700.599999999999s)]
*  I think you're pretty much yourself in everything I've seen you in. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4703.679999999999s)]
*  You have like a consistency. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4707.2s)]
*  As far as? [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4709.12s)]
*  Just your personality. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4710.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4711.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4712.12s)]
*  Like I don't think you fluctuate, but I thought that it showed a side of him. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4713.12s)]
*  That no one had seen, right? [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4716.96s)]
*  That's what it was. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4718.599999999999s)]
*  That was really interesting. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4719.76s)]
*  And you can draw it out. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4720.76s)]
*  We have a second one that for my pod with Mitch, me, him and Mitch, the great war happened [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4721.76s)]
*  and then we never dropped it. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4726.72s)]
*  But we have an episode that is so, so funny. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4728.08s)]
*  It is so... [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4730.92s)]
*  It's just like an hour just like fucking kicking the shit. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4731.92s)]
*  That's the thing is like there are certain people that bring out sides of you that not [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4736.84s)]
*  everybody sees. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4740.84s)]
*  And I think that was one of the reasons why it's super successful. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4742.96s)]
*  Obviously, you guys are huge. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4746.04s)]
*  That's why I mean that was the thing with the pod. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4747.04s)]
*  I wanted to like bring people on and have those conversations that people don't usually [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4749.0s)]
*  have. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4752.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4753.84s)]
*  And you have a relationship with them where they'll open up to you in a different way. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4754.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4758.12s)]
*  And we're sitting in my bedroom. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4759.12s)]
*  So like... [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4760.12s)]
*  I thought you did that with Sweetie actually. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4761.12s)]
*  I was listening. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4762.56s)]
*  I was like, oh, this is a side of her that I don't think most people exist. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4763.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4765.56s)]
*  That was a great episode. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4766.56s)]
*  That was my first like long conversation with her. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4767.56s)]
*  Wait, really? [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4770.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4771.64s)]
*  We met before, but that was a great conversation. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4772.64s)]
*  Mitch was very intimidated. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4774.96s)]
*  He was. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4776.56s)]
*  He's a huge fan of her. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4778.120000000001s)]
*  She's just a very attractive woman. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4779.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4781.6s)]
*  Mitch had to lock it down. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4782.6s)]
*  He had to control himself. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4783.6s)]
*  He was accurate. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4784.6s)]
*  Dude, he actually made a jersey with Sweetie's name on it. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4785.6s)]
*  It's not a bad thing. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4788.6s)]
*  It's a good thing. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4791.6s)]
*  It's a better move than the other one, but it's still... [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4793.6s)]
*  Yo, King was super embarrassed. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4797.6s)]
*  Can you break down the whole Bobby fallout? [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4800.400000000001s)]

*  I believe so, yeah. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4868.0s)]
*  But why'd you give her that look? [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4869.0s)]
*  Because to everyone else it looked like she's an industry player. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4870.0s)]
*  You know what's so crazy? [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4873.0s)]
*  That's just how similar me and her are. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4874.0s)]
*  We both found her at the same time and didn't talk about it. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4877.0s)]
*  And we did our episodes separately until she was like, yeah, I just did Drake. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4880.0s)]
*  And I was like, wait, what? [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4884.0s)]
*  Oh, you guys did not know? [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4885.0s)]
*  No, we had no clue. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4886.0s)]
*  We both found her on TikTok. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4887.0s)]
*  Just we started swiping. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4888.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4889.0s)]
*  And we both reached out to her and then we both did our episode. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4890.84s)]
*  And then like, yeah. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4893.84s)]
*  Wow. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4895.84s)]

*  He sent me a video that I had watched literally 30 seconds before. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4898.84s)]
*  And this happens so often where your algorithms are parallel to somebody else. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4903.84s)]
*  I thought that... that's interesting. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4908.84s)]
*  She banked a bunch of episodes. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4911.84s)]
*  I thought that the Drake shit dropped and then you were like, oh, this girl's kind of fun. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4913.84s)]
*  I'm going to do an episode. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4917.84s)]
*  So it was done by the time the Drake episode came out. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4918.84s)]
*  Wow. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=4920.88s)]

*  But I didn't know he did a roast. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5426.719999999999s)]
*  Not a roast. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5428.16s)]
*  He did a speech. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5428.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, when he wore that jacket, that big. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5429.759999999999s)]
*  And he had the Nike check in his head. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5431.5199999999995s)]
*  The Nike braid. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5433.08s)]
*  But he was doing jokes. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5434.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5438.08s)]
*  He's hilarious. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5438.64s)]
*  He's one of the funniest people I know. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5439.360000000001s)]
*  And I hit him and I was like, it's not that. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5440.56s)]
*  There are some people funny just hanging out. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5443.04s)]
*  And then there's other people that when they're delivering [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5445.04s)]
*  jokes, they're asking for a lot. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5448.200000000001s)]
*  They're begging the audience to react. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5450.200000000001s)]
*  And there's other people who just let it happen. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5451.88s)]
*  Like fucking Theobon. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5454.08s)]
*  Wait, who is that? [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5455.72s)]
*  He's just letting it happen. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5456.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5457.6s)]
*  Theobon, it's just so natural. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5458.08s)]
*  He's going to say it. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5460.4400000000005s)]
*  And whether you react or not. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5461.360000000001s)]
*  Whatever. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5462.84s)]
*  His face is stale. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5463.360000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5464.360000000001s)]
*  Whatever. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5465.0s)]
*  So Drake, I thought, delivered really fucking well. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5465.72s)]
*  And it was one of those things where it's like, yes, [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5469.64s)]
*  he's obviously active before the SNL shit was fired. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5472.52s)]
*  And maybe he just loves making music. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5476.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5478.08s)]
*  Because I'm sure he gets a million opportunities. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5478.6s)]
*  He loves living life the way he wants to live. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5480.6s)]
*  And you can't do that when you're acting. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5483.4800000000005s)]
*  I just think that he would only do it [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5485.56s)]
*  if it's something he wanted to do. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5488.6s)]
*  No person could tell him, bro, you were great here. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5490.0s)]
*  You should. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5492.2s)]
*  You ever sat with him? [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5493.04s)]
*  No. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5494.320000000001s)]
*  I mean, he's just very much like he lives his life the way [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5495.16s)]
*  he wants. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5498.8s)]
*  No one can. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5499.28s)]
*  You can't joke him into doing something. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5500.0s)]
*  You can't shame him into doing what the fuck he want to do. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5504.08s)]
*  You know what impressed me acting wise? [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5506.639999999999s)]
*  I'm not even saying this is a shot. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5508.5199999999995s)]
*  Again, I want to be respectful, your boy. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5510.12s)]
*  But the Damar DeRozan sketch, there's [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5511.84s)]
*  a line where the guy says his name is Damar. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5513.68s)]
*  And Drake is like, Damar. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5515.5599999999995s)]
*  Damar, I hear it. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5517.04s)]
*  Damar, I hate it. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5518.12s)]
*  Or something like that. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5519.12s)]
*  And the delivery is really funny. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5520.16s)]
*  He's a funny like. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5521.48s)]
*  He's fucking hilarious. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5522.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5524.12s)]
*  So it's really, I just don't want to go do this thing that's [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5524.64s)]
*  going to take me away from living the life I want. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5527.360000000001s)]
*  I don't know why he don't want. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5528.68s)]
*  I told him, bro, he could play any role. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5529.72s)]
*  He's a guy. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5532.68s)]
*  I don't know why he could play a great mob boss. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5534.04s)]
*  Was there like, I remember when the whole beef happened, [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5537.84s)]
*  if I was him, I would be resentful. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5541.56s)]
*  Because the narrative was, he sees these young artists, [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5545.240000000001s)]
*  he does a feature for them, they blow the fuck up. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5549.280000000001s)]
*  And he's done that tons of fucking times. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5552.08s)]
*  500 times. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5554.28s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5555.28s)]
*  And then the narrative changed to, oh, he's using them [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5555.88s)]
*  to be cool. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5559.96s)]
*  He's. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5560.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5561.32s)]
*  Would you, like if I'm him, I really resent that. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5562.12s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5565.28s)]
*  Shit, like, niggas is lame. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5565.84s)]
*  Why are they? [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5567.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5569.32s)]
*  Why this nigga is lame? [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5569.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5570.719999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5571.2s)]
*  It just is the way it is. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5572.0s)]
*  Is it because. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5573.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5573.8s)]
*  That's the thing. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5574.5599999999995s)]
*  We're talking about rap niggas. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5575.08s)]
*  I'm talking about people in general. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5576.12s)]
*  It's very easy in this business to be completely [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5579.16s)]
*  egocentric and only care about the things that fuel you. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5583.24s)]
*  And a lot of people are like that. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5585.76s)]
*  A lot of people don't care to help. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5588.0s)]
*  It's just how it be, man. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5589.639999999999s)]
*  You do shit when people turn around. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5590.599999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5592.4s)]
*  Like, I'm sure he's put people on that didn't necessarily [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5593.36s)]
*  have a cloud overlap. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5595.4s)]
*  What we mean is sure. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5596.88s)]
*  It's happened publicly. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5598.08s)]
*  We've seen this. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5599.16s)]
*  Yes. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5599.8s)]
*  But almost everyone, bro. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5600.5199999999995s)]
*  The trick of the trick is real. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5602.32s)]
*  It's deeper than we even know. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5603.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5604.88s)]
*  And there was no necessarily benefit to him. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5605.88s)]
*  He just wanted to help someone out. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5607.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5609.36s)]
*  Like I said, direct on charge for a feature and all that. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5609.84s)]
*  He doesn't charge anyone for a feature. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5614.16s)]
*  No. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5616.12s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5617.12s)]
*  You're going to give him 100 grand? [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5618.68s)]
*  If he did, it would be, what the fuck would it be? [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5619.76s)]
*  300, 400,000? [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5621.24s)]
*  Just because you have money, that [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5622.5199999999995s)]
*  doesn't mean you don't want more. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5624.5199999999995s)]
*  But he's just a kind person, bro. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5625.76s)]
*  But then you've got to do a track. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5626.96s)]

*  And this is like, the beef is starting to kind of come down [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5656.2s)]
*  a little bit. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5659.8s)]
*  And it's not like the DJ was trying to play Drake. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5661.92s)]
*  It was just a party, and you played the hits over the last [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5664.68s)]
*  decade. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5667.72s)]
*  And the way that the crowd was reacting to Drake, [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5670.24s)]
*  it was like there wasn't a beef happening. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5674.16s)]
*  Yeah, because in reality, bro, outside of the people who care [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5676.16s)]

*  And they just want to party. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5684.4s)]
*  There's some beautiful girl they want to dance with. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5685.599999999999s)]
*  And they want to dance to Drake. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5687.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5688.599999999999s)]
*  God's plan is going to come on. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5688.88s)]
*  And then you're going to fucking dance to it. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5689.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5691.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5692.96s)]
*  He really didn't give a fuck. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5693.76s)]
*  Really? [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5695.88s)]
*  No. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5696.4s)]
*  He was genuinely unfazed. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5697.92s)]
*  I respected it a lot. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5700.24s)]
*  And I talked to him. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5701.4s)]
*  That shit didn't bother him. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5702.5599999999995s)]
*  That's his shit. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5704.24s)]
*  And he's a fucking guy. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5704.92s)]
*  But if I had $700 million, I would fucking talk to him. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5707.08s)]
*  It got to bother you a little bit. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5711.04s)]
*  If you're an artist, you're sensitive. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5712.599999999999s)]
*  You feel the world. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5714.72s)]
*  That would make you guys great. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5715.5599999999995s)]
*  Obviously, you. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5716.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5718.48s)]
*  I wasn't there. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5719.28s)]
*  Like I said, I was in Europe. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5720.24s)]
*  I wasn't next to him, like how I usually do be. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5721.84s)]
*  But he was. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5725.8s)]
*  I never saw him down. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5728.52s)]
*  Ever. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5731.08s)]
*  I never saw him kicking his fucking foot, [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5731.6s)]
*  holding his head down. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5733.52s)]
*  And then to a point where I just stopped talking to him about it. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5736.2s)]
*  Because I felt like I was the one bringing him the negativity. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5739.360000000001s)]
*  I was bringing the cloud when I would be like, oh, man. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5742.400000000001s)]
*  Man, I hate that this person said this. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5745.52s)]
*  I was showing him shit he hadn't seen. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5748.64s)]
*  So then I started realizing, I'm bringing you the negativity. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5750.28s)]
*  Let me stop. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5753.04s)]
*  I understand that also where you don't [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5754.56s)]
*  want to ignore it completely. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5756.24s)]
*  And then you don't seem like an authentic friend who's seeing shit. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5757.76s)]
*  Right, that's true. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5760.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5761.639999999999s)]
*  But I just realized that his energy wasn't down. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5762.639999999999s)]
*  So I wasn't going to try to. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5766.88s)]
*  Bring him down. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5768.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5768.84s)]
*  OK. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5769.679999999999s)]
*  And then we wrap this up soon. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5772.8s)]
*  But I do need to know, are there any aspirations [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5774.84s)]
*  to have your own clothing line? [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5777.08s)]
*  Yeah, we're working on that right now. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5782.28s)]
*  OK, that is going to happen. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5783.88s)]
*  For years, I've dubbed the idea because it's like, [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5786.0s)]
*  is this another like, bro, you can't have that shit. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5789.44s)]
*  I couldn't have. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5793.96s)]
*  These podcasts are procrastinating. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5794.8s)]
*  Because you have to put an episode out every other week. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5796.28s)]
*  You can't skip. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5798.28s)]
*  Yep. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5798.96s)]
*  No matter where you are in the world. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5799.72s)]
*  We have to fly people to Germany once. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5801.96s)]
*  So I guess you have to get it done. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5803.68s)]
*  Same with a brand. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5807.0s)]
*  It takes hours. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5808.6s)]
*  Not that it can't be done. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5810.12s)]
*  But I know what that looks like. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5811.36s)]
*  You bring in all that extra work. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5813.4s)]
*  My nights are already taken by music. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5816.92s)]
*  Certain days, my day is taken on by a film episode. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5819.2s)]
*  Now doing fucking the brand is you're adding on, [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5822.92s)]
*  and then you got a kid, and you know. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5826.28s)]

*  I hear you. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5831.879999999999s)]
*  That's why you got to get married, bro. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5836.32s)]
*  Lock it down. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzPmTs_ywA&t=5837.639999999999s)]
