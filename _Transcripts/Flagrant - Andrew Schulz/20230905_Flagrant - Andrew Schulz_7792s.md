# Burning Man Flooded, FouseyTube Arrested, & Logan Paul Vs Dillon Danis Goes Too Far?
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [September 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs)
*  What's up everybody and welcome to Flagrant and I just want to let you all know right now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=0.0s)]
*  I know there's been a lot of messages because there was a lot of concern [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4.0s)]
*  You're like are you guys okay at burning man? I know you're stuck in the mud. Is everything okay? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6.72s)]
*  Is everybody safe? Is everybody having enough food? Is everybody having enough water and the answer to all that is yes [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=10.24s)]
*  Because we were in the hamptons where they have almost no mud and they have tons of water and tons of food [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=15.6s)]
*  We're having an absolutely amazing time and Akash was obviously filming his newest special. Yeah, let's go [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=20.96s)]
*  Now [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  Any regrets [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  Uh for not being at burning man. We know that you have none you guys. I think this might be the most fun year [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  I think so akash has a bunch of regrets [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=38.8s)]
*  All that [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=42.96s)]
*  Come on son if there was one year you [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=45.92s)]
*  This is the year I should have gone [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=48.56s)]
*  This is how you know god don't want me at burning man because he took me out the one year [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=50.56s)]
*  I would have liked or yeah [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=53.84s)]
*  Or he was like damn we were too hard on that kid the first time we need to give him his ideal burning man [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=55.44s)]
*  This time around yeah, but then he wouldn't put it this weekend. He wouldn't put the special date this weekend [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=60.48s)]
*  That's how it all felt god don't want me at burning man, bro. He wants me to stay faithful to my wife [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=64.64s)]
*  Away from the mud is it count? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=69.92s)]
*  It doesn't count as cheating in your culture when you guys fuck the ground. Yeah, because we love it so much [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=71.2s)]
*  But that does count as cheating it has to [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=76.24s)]
*  You know, I mean, it's just like it's the passion about that. It's not it's not the fucking it's the passion with which we do it [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=78.47999999999999s)]
*  You know emotional cheating. Yeah [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=84.8s)]
*  And try to not beat your dick [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=89.28s)]
*  Just imagine that just imagine any time you exit your tent [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=91.44s)]
*  You could just michael jackson dance where they just like on the ground or he's like you remember that shit. Oh jeez that bombed [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=95.12s)]
*  If you remembered it then it would have been [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=106.96s)]
*  Yeah [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=108.96s)]
*  I want to teach individually to apologize to alex for sure [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=124.88s)]
*  Alex you're right. I'm sorry. I apologize. Yeah, I should have known about the michael jackson dance where he does that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=128.24s)]
*  I accept your I don't know how it slipped my mind we can proceed. I don't know what [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=134.24s)]
*  I think mark you're 100% right [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=139.04000000000002s)]
*  I think listen as annoying as it would be and obviously looking at it right now going okay [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=140.96s)]
*  I'm pretty glad we weren't there. It looks kind of fucking crazy. Can't leave whenever you want [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=146.24s)]
*  Everybody's full of fucking mud. It looks disgusting. I do think [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=150.88s)]
*  That it would be the best burning man. Yes, dude. I mean that 100% [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=155.12s)]
*  I think hardcore burners are very happy this happened because it's gonna weed out the people who are like, oh, yeah [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, 100% put a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=164.8s)]
*  Also, like the burning man is about doing drugs [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=168.96s)]
*  But it's also about connecting with people on drugs [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=172.4s)]
*  Yes, and the best way to connect with people is drugs, but [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=176.88s)]
*  The second best way to connect with people is to have a group struggle. Yeah, that's right. That's true [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=180.56s)]
*  And it's why like everybody in canada is so nice is because you need to be nice to your neighbor because you might die [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=186.32s)]
*  Your heat goes out in the winter. It's negative 40 [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=192.0s)]
*  You'll die you need to be able to go to your neighbor's house and say hey, how you doing? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=194.0s)]
*  Can I stay with you so I don't die my family doesn't die. They go, of course you can so they're polite [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=198.0s)]
*  They're kind. Yeah, like crossFit people are weird [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=202.0s)]
*  Keep going on that because they're all hanging out doing hard work together all the time four days a week and by the end [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=204.48s)]
*  Of like a month. They're like you're my brother. Yeah [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  Work out together like no, no [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=211.67999999999998s)]
*  It has to be [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=215.35999999999999s)]
*  Almost death it has to be that level because I thought about this [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=216.72s)]
*  I was like well why it's not just inclement weather because then people in portland would be nice, right? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=219.67999999999998s)]
*  But the problem with portland is it's just rain. Yeah, it doesn't kill you [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=223.60000000000002s)]
*  It's the perfect amount to just drive you crazy without ever hurting you no bonding. No [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=228.24s)]
*  It's sadness, but not hardship. There you go hardship comes together. Yeah hardship brings you an army. Yeah, you're going against the mud [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=234.72s)]
*  You know, I think that's what the british used to do [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=243.12s)]
*  Isn't it was? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  No, okay. I'll take it out [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=247.60000000000002s)]
*  I'm saying [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=250.56s)]
*  I just didn't get it. It wasn't it. There was there I do [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  Getting that joke. I apologize dude. Yeah, that's not me. It's on me fucking hell. Okay. Let me get it back [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=257.52s)]
*  Let me get it back. Let me get it back. Okay. So the point is [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  I think that this would be by far the most fun-burning man to be at [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=266.4s)]
*  And uh, is there a little part of me that's up that said that we didn't go? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=271.68s)]
*  Yeah [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=276.0s)]
*  But we also had a fucking incredible time [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=277.28s)]
*  Like it was this week was fantastic talk about it. That's right. Well, I first want to talk about your uh, especial [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=280.64s)]
*  I mean maybe the best weekend of my life really yeah like up there with the wedding really yeah [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  And I don't even feel bad saying that I don't feel bad. What do you mean up there? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=290.71999999999997s)]
*  It's like tied for first and it might be first how close I mean it might beat out the wedding [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=294.96s)]
*  Only mentioned his wedding just so he doesn't die tonight [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=299.12s)]
*  No, you will see this when you get married that's a fucking unbelievable thing [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=303.03999999999996s)]
*  But my wife is also here with me shared the whole thing and she'd been with me through all the broke shit [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=306.47999999999996s)]
*  So like I have an out to be like hey you you know what I mean? You were at both [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=310.15999999999997s)]
*  So I can kind of get away with it. But the wedding is amazing [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=314.08s)]
*  It's like a different level of happiness, but this was like you get this because we're older [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=317.03999999999996s)]
*  What the one hour comedy special has meant to us our whole lives? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=321.2s)]
*  I remember watching bring the pain and being like what the fuck I remember [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=325.44s)]
*  Downloading killing them softly on an album and playing on the team [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=328.64s)]

*  I just I wanted to just put everything I had into this thing and I did I gave every ounce I have and I felt [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=482.72s)]
*  Like I made something really [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=488.32000000000005s)]
*  Fucking great. I really do and [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=489.84s)]
*  After that, I i'm not sure where we're gonna go [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=492.24s)]
*  We're gonna talk to some people some networks are already kind of talking to us [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=494.4s)]
*  So we're gonna see what what that looks like what the youtube route looks like we're gonna compare and then we'll figure that out [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=497.36s)]
*  Right now it's just take like a week or two kind of decompress and then get in the edit and figure it out [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=502.96s)]
*  But let me just ask you one question about your shirt. Yeah, when you put your shirts on [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=507.2s)]
*  Do you put them on feet first through the collar? Why is that? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=511.44s)]
*  I just I wore this when I like do you open the collar and stick your feet in and then bring the whole thing? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=515.84s)]
*  Up to your shoulders. Is that why because something happens around here? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=522.64s)]
*  Where I mean I can put my whole fist into your shirt going going without even really stretching the collar [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=527.12s)]
*  So I need you to explain because you have beautiful head your head in your whole life has never gained weight [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=533.44s)]

*  Beautiful fucking head so I need to understand why the collar gets stuck [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=544.24s)]
*  I think it is I have a weird thing if something's sitting on my neck and I always just adjust the collar [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=547.6s)]
*  It's just like a weird you're not strong enough to stretch out the collar [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=551.76s)]
*  That was great mud joke made no sense [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=564.48s)]

*  Yes, I will be saying that yes [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1633.96s)]
*  It's the only young people are playing paddle. I haven't seen one person that was all playing paddle. It's young people playing paddle [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1635.96s)]
*  Here's the thing paddle basically for everybody's watching go look at some youtube videos. It's ping pong, right? [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1641.32s)]
*  No, that's pickle. Let me explain it. It's pickle ball is a game. Okay tennis is a sport [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1646.6s)]
*  Paddle is in between the two. It's a lifestyle. It's a lifestyle [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1653.64s)]
*  Bro, you know pickle here you explain the shit. You never did. No, i'm on but look i'm on board with you [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1658.1200000000001s)]
*  Because one it was coming. It was created by a spanish man [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1663.88s)]
*  Exactly because he was too lazy to get the tennis ball when it got past him [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1667.8799999999999s)]
*  So he's like yo, let's just put up some walls [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1672.9199999999998s)]
*  So the shit never gets past me and we don't have to go run and get the ball. This shit's just always in play [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1675.3999999999999s)]
*  That's why they treated it that game. Yeah genius game. It's genius [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1680.68s)]
*  I mean, what's wrong with that? It's a game created for a lazy motherfucker who didn't want to walk and get a bowl [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1683.96s)]
*  It's still a great game [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1690.04s)]
*  But it's it's not lazy. It sounds like he wants to keep playing non-stop. Yeah [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1691.56s)]
*  It sounds like he actually wants to volley he actually wants to get some exercise he actually wants to have fun [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1695.8000000000002s)]
*  He wants to play non-stop. You know what I mean? Yeah or not. Anyway, the point i'm trying to make real sports [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1699.88s)]
*  Alex likes the break I think of like the ball going out and like going walking going to get it. No, I like [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1705.72s)]
*  Playing real sports. I like playing real sports. No [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1710.44s)]
*  Like you guys are playing the softball of tennis [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1713.16s)]
*  I'm not knocking tennis tennis is a more sophisticated sport. It's harder to play real [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1716.52s)]
*  Real real if you're stuffing balls in your underwear, is it real first of all, it's in your skirt [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1721.32s)]
*  So my point is this [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1729.1599999999999s)]
*  Wait, didn't dub be you? Nah, of course. He did six one six one [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1730.84s)]
*  Can I ask you a question afraid to come back? How did he get that game? [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1735.7199999999998s)]
*  And I don't mean that as an insult to you, but I don't i'm shocked. He got a game [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1738.9199999999998s)]
*  How'd he win a game twice and I just started playing [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1742.9199999999998s)]
*  Just started just picked up the racket he's been taking lessons. I just picked up four years [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1746.2800000000002s)]
*  I beat him six one six one son. I looked embarrassed after that. You have another man teaching you how to be gay [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1751.16s)]
*  That's unbelievable [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1757.64s)]
*  You're paying a guy two hundred dollars to be gay. I'm paying a woman dude. Yeah, is a woman teaching you that's even worse [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1759.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, a woman is teaching you a sport. She is in what world do we exist? [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1765.0s)]
*  I'm not doing well because I don't wear the skirt and I'm going [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1770.76s)]
*  Uh, I she was like yo go and i'm not going when I hit it and that's why i'm losing she's telling you [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1773.48s)]
*  She's telling me to go. Uh, okay. That's the thing dub was all day [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1778.84s)]
*  Anyway, he got that I did when you paid me the two hundred dollars for losing [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1783.0s)]
*  I'm not gonna lie while we were in the hamptons. I used an incredible invention [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1789.8s)]
*  One of the greatest things about this country is that we will find a way to turn [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1793.0s)]
*  Anything into a gun. We have a glue gun. We have a staple gun. Everything gets turned into a gun [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1797.1599999999999s)]
*  If it is something we value we turn it into a gun [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1803.08s)]
*  And we finally did it with barbecuing. Is there anything more american than barbecuing? No, there's not [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1808.12s)]
*  Okay, the only problem with barbecuing is that there's no gun element until now [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1813.1599999999999s)]

*  So it's just kind of coming on who is going to appropriate it over here. Yeah, it could be finance bros [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1953.8799999999999s)]
*  um [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1960.28s)]
*  Anyone that was playing tennis years ago, even if they were doing it just recreationally are stepping into it and then they're addicted quick [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1961.0s)]
*  Yeah, so you're seeing that and they actually at least now like oh wow new sport right away. I mean, yeah [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1967.8s)]

*  100 try tennis first and then try that [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1978.92s)]
*  It's a fun game why can't games be fun alex? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1987.0s)]
*  No as a game can we play a sport and then play a game? [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1989.32s)]
*  Why can't we play a game? We could play a game, but let's play sport then play a game. Okay, we can do all that [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1991.96s)]
*  Another thing that I want to say an observation from this this this week when we are away [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=1997.96s)]
*  um [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2002.52s)]
*  I think I understand what airbnb's [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2003.96s)]
*  like purpose in the ecosystem is and this is going to seem redundant because it's quite obvious, but like [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2007.24s)]
*  I always looked at airbnb as this like replacement for [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2013.64s)]
*  A hotel I would just be like, oh can I get a nicer house than I can hotel for the same price? Yeah, right? [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2017.8s)]
*  and going out to the hamptons and [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2024.76s)]
*  We had you know, it was a nice group of us. There was like seven of us, right? [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2027.56s)]
*  and [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2031.4s)]
*  I realized [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2033.4s)]
*  the airbnb experience [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2035.08s)]
*  for for me is [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2037.24s)]
*  Replicating traveling with family or friends, right? [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2039.78s)]
*  It's just like what is it like if you have a home in this place and you get to have all those intimate moments? [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2042.6s)]
*  The great thing about going away with your partner and staying in a hotel is fucking awesome [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2047.96s)]
*  You have all these amenities and everybody's serving you etc [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2051.08s)]
*  But when you go away with eight fucking people [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2053.8s)]
*  And you're all in your each little room [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2056.44s)]
*  And the only time you're really hanging out is maybe you agree to go to the pool or maybe you agree to go do an activity [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2058.36s)]
*  And then you maybe see each other at dinner [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2062.6000000000004s)]
*  But having this kind of communal living where you're all kind of busting balls joking telling stories and just connecting the whole time [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2064.92s)]
*  Man, it was fucking awesome [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2071.6400000000003s)]
*  It was really it was really fucking awesome. And uh [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2073.32s)]
*  I never looked at airbnb in that way because I always was looking for the value play [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2077.0800000000004s)]
*  I was like, oh can I get the nicer home than I can the hotel? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2081.64s)]
*  But now i'm looking at in terms of like if i'm going away with a group of people even when we're on the road [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2085.0s)]
*  Like if it's a group of us and we're staying in a city for x amount of shows or whatever [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2090.12s)]
*  I'm like I want to just get a house [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2094.2s)]
*  I just want to get a house and have everybody there everybody busting balls everybody cooking together everybody drinking together everybody [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2096.2s)]
*  barbecuing together and you really kind of see the group congeal and come together in this beautiful way and [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2102.02s)]
*  Yeah, it was just it was really cool so shout them out I wanted to shout them out if you're on the other side if you're [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2108.6800000000003s)]
*  Trying to airbnb your place [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2113.0800000000004s)]
*  Definitely and i'm speaking from experience [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2116.1000000000004s)]
*  Make sure they book through airbnb [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2119.2400000000002s)]
*  Because um, so I do property management a little bit and there was a place that I had that I was renting out [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2121.48s)]
*  And the guy was like, oh, hey, let's go off of airbnb [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2126.84s)]
*  No, maybe won't take the cut. You'll make a little bit more money [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2130.1200000000003s)]
*  That person rented out that place stayed there for three months [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2134.44s)]

*  Too quick, dude. They took one shower [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2242.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy jews would be a little bit more nervous about what shower they get in you saw [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2245.1600000000003s)]
*  You saw the smekkel [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2253.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, not big gotta be honest. So what happened with yours al? [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2255.08s)]
*  He left eventually on his own accord [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2259.88s)]
*  Yeah, but he moved into your place. It took three months. Did you show up to the place? I showed up to the place and [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2262.6800000000003s)]
*  I showed up in a way that like I would have thought he left after that [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2268.6000000000004s)]
*  God [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2272.52s)]
*  No, but he's still tall and he was like he's been occupying places. Yeah [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2273.88s)]
*  Yeah, this is his house. He's definitely had done this is what they did in palestine actually [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2278.52s)]
*  Yo, but it was crazy and I had to just eat that steal your house, bro [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2284.76s)]
*  Yeah, so in new york they have these like really intense tenant right situation [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2288.6s)]
*  So if you rent a place and then stop paying rent, I think you have six months [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2294.52s)]
*  To stay there before you get kicked out. Yeah, I believe it's six months [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2300.36s)]
*  You could just say I can't afford it and then you stay there for six months [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2304.2s)]
*  So I think oftentimes there are people that find ways to get these leases signed stay for six months [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2307.56s)]
*  They get kicked out get another one get another one get another and can't it could be a bougie ass place [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2312.52s)]
*  Usually they're doing credit checks, but if you can get around the system, but you all pay you all cash [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2316.6s)]
*  They'll give you that first month, but they're really giving you six months [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2320.52s)]
*  And I was the fuck I tried to get a little extra money and I fucking paid for that [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2323.48s)]
*  Isn't that the lesson though? You never found a guy though? Like you never know [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2328.6s)]
*  I would have been in if I found them. Yeah, like I was really that upset [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2333.08s)]
*  Fuck so you were covering the bills that whole time. Yeah, did he fuck up the place too, bro? [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2337.56s)]
*  He's like cigarette butts everywhere [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2342.52s)]
*  All the dishes the dishes were fucking piled high. It's like he just didn't wash the dish [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2345.3999999999996s)]
*  He just used every single fucking dish in the entire place [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2348.7599999999998s)]
*  Like it was a pig you couldn't turn off the electricity or like turn off the gas you can't legally [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2352.12s)]
*  Yeah, what about wait for him to leave and then go in and then change the lot [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2357.8799999999997s)]
*  I lived far and this is the time we were working so it's like i'm gone all the time and you own the place [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2362.4399999999996s)]
*  What? Yeah [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2368.9199999999996s)]
*  Okay [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2369.96s)]

*  I mean, yeah, there's gotta be something you could do if someone moves in your place and they don't leave [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2376.04s)]
*  You know, I was just in this situation right now charlie laduff with my old apartment with the sublet [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2378.84s)]

*  And because she was mocking her but I was not fat norwegian fucking cow. I will destroy her [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2387.16s)]
*  She stopped paying [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2395.7200000000003s)]
*  And I'm considered the over tenant she's a sub tenant [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2397.48s)]

*  Problem with new york city. She's got all the rights even though she's my sub tenant [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2407.0s)]
*  She's like in order to get her out. We have to sue you dove [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2410.6s)]
*  And evict you and then the eviction will happen [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2415.72s)]

*  Testosterone and no muscle mass or the ability to burn fat like i've had my entire life [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2629.14s)]
*  Is that I keep a full head of hair and you high testosterone fucks would go bald by the time we were 33 [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2634.36s)]
*  And that was the only silver lining to the dark cloud that is my genetic code [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2639.48s)]
*  Unfortunately, these fucking idiots at keeps are ruining the only advantage I had in my entire life [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2645.2200000000003s)]

*  Deon sanders won his first game at colorado. Can you explain why this is a big deal? Let's talk a little sports real quick deon [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2728.1200000000003s)]
*  Uh first, you know greatest cornerback of all time every cornerback you watch now is basically just trying to be deon [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2734.76s)]
*  Maybe greatest athlete of all time. Maybe just in terms of athleticism, but then he starts coaching at jackson state in hbcu [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2740.28s)]
*  And it works he's fucking good jackson state is good. What is an hbcu? [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2746.52s)]
*  Black college university, you're right. I should have explained that so [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2752.04s)]
*  These hbcus where you would think they would always be athletically gifted because so many division one college 12 players are black [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2755.2400000000002s)]
*  They just don't seem to want to go there because they don't have the recruiting power of these alabamas and these uts [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2761.56s)]
*  And by recruiting power, it's not just a financial situation. It's also tv time, right? [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2767.32s)]
*  When you go to alabama you go to auburn you go to what are some of the texas georgia [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2771.7999999999997s)]
*  Georgia you're gonna get on tv more coaches are gonna see you and you're gonna be competing against other elite athletes [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2777.24s)]
*  And that's really how a lot of nfl coaches sharpened iron nfl is watching like what is the division? [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2782.92s)]
*  You know more about yes the sec. Yeah, they run a pro style offense a lot of times in [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2787.8799999999997s)]
*  It's just where the they always seem to win the national championship [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2793.24s)]
*  So now all the good players are like I want to play in the sec for the powerhouse teams [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2796.3599999999997s)]
*  Their their games are always in prime time always lsu and alabama is a massive rivalry that everybody watches georgia and alabama georgia lsu [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2800.44s)]
*  Alabama auburn huge. Yeah. Yeah, so like the sec gets gets everybody ut [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2808.12s)]
*  Bcu's are not getting the same level of talent, but deon made waves at the hbcu [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2813.7200000000003s)]
*  But he eventually he always said i'm going to leave one an opportunity presents itself. That's worth it and he went to [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2818.52s)]
*  Colorado university i guess or university of colorado which has never been [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2824.6800000000003s)]
*  He got like a 27 million dollar contract and I think the university said I saw a post about this [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2829.0800000000004s)]
*  I think the university said we don't have the money to pay him, but we will yeah [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2834.36s)]
*  And he agrees to go and I think that the the boosters or the donors of the school raised 28 million dollars almost immediately [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2837.48s)]
*  And they sold out every single game. Yeah, and they have so now they have more than enough money to pay [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2844.6000000000004s)]
*  And I am very much a casual college football fan [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2850.12s)]
*  I will keep up kind of casually throughout the year from sports center or whatever and then it interest built [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2853.2400000000002s)]
*  I was immediately interested in deon going to colorado [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2858.36s)]
*  Because he talks a big talk and he is a confident arrogant guy have also always always has been but backs it up [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2861.32s)]
*  But like little things like at a postgame presser people kept saying deon deon deon. Hey deon [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2868.28s)]
*  What are you gonna even say call me coach prime or coach sanders? [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2873.4s)]
*  Don't call me deon. You don't do that to nick savon [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2876.2000000000003s)]
*  You don't call nick saving nick and we even I was like buddy. We know you as deon [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2878.04s)]
*  It's not that big a deal [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2881.96s)]
*  Yeah, he but he talks that shit and then he goes to this program and he the first day he gets there [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2883.0s)]
*  They film him speaking to the team that's currently there and they go a lot of y'all might as well just transfer [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2889.48s)]
*  Whatever the fuck you knew football to be is over the way you used to do things is over [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2895.32s)]
*  Everything is changing. I'm gonna make my son the quarterback. Should do her sanders. He's nice. He's got to earn it [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2900.2799999999997s)]
*  He's probably he's coming in to be quarterback and he brings in like 75% of the team brand new [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2905.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, new transfers highest transfer rate. Holy shit. I don't even know that's exact 75% [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2910.44s)]
*  But it's a massive number of transfers plus his new recruits. I assume so people are kind of like what's gonna happen [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2915.64s)]
*  I thought he would do well. Wasn't there a guy that played on both sides of the ball? Yes, travis hunter [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2922.52s)]
*  Yeah, his so his first game his son is playing quarterback. He's got this guy playing both sides of the ball [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2928.04s)]
*  In this like colorado, he's never coached at this level. He's talking shit [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2933.32s)]
*  Everybody kind of is divided a lot of people want him to fail think he's gonna fail [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2937.88s)]
*  A lot of people think he's gonna do great. This is deon and or fans [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2943.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, and then they play tcu who was last year's second ranked team in the country [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2945.8s)]
*  They lost in the national championship. They beat tcu in overtime [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2951.4s)]
*  I think it was not our time but it's like 45 42 or something close game [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2955.0800000000004s)]
*  But this program that has never really been that good [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2958.44s)]
*  Beats the team that made it to the national championship last year [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2962.92s)]
*  Wow, not a historical powerhouse, but you should they were fucking number two in the country last year beats them [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2966.2000000000003s)]
*  His son throws for 500 yards. Whoa plays out of his mind dime passes everywhere [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2972.1200000000003s)]
*  This kid travis hunter plays pretty much he plays like both sides of the ball almost every snap plays out of his mind [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2976.84s)]
*  Interception what position is he playing wide receiver cornerback? I believe I receive cornerback. Holy shit [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2983.8s)]
*  100 yards last [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2988.2799999999997s)]
*  In the pack 12 last year won an 11 last and then they went from the pack 12 [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2989.88s)]
*  Which is a dying division to the big 12 which isn't like the sec, but it's a better division [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2993.08s)]
*  They moved divisions beat the the team that won that conference last year [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=2997.56s)]
*  Sorry, not division conference team won that conference last year and then deon goes in the post game and he says this is the [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3001.56s)]
*  Clip that I saw going around [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3008.12s)]
*  He said a lot of times when people see a black man talking like I talk walking like I walk [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3009.64s)]
*  Talking to athletes that are 75 black they get a little threatened [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3015.7200000000003s)]
*  But we hear and this is what we're doing and we're gonna make noise and we're not going nowhere talking to athletes that are 75 [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3019.8s)]
*  Yeah, like not the percent not each black person is 75 black, but the team is 75 black people like it's [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3025.32s)]
*  And is that rare in sports? So what that's what a lot of people were saying? [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3031.7200000000003s)]
*  That's not rare in sports [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3034.92s)]
*  But what he's saying is rare is a black coach talking that shit and then backing it up [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3035.96s)]
*  We know nick saban is a great coach we know [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3041.24s)]
*  Whoever the historic people bo shembikler. What a fuck. I'm not can't jim harbaugh all these names that we know of like [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3044.28s)]
*  Hey, these are great coaches and we kind of see them as [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3050.36s)]
*  somewhat stodgy white guys [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3053.72s)]
*  Or just older white men and that's what we've seen and that's not bad. I have no problem with that [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3056.12s)]
*  But what deon is saying is I think some people out there might be threatened by the fact that here's a an arrogant black dude [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3060.68s)]
*  Talking to black people [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3067.8s)]
*  As a coach and winning and kind of disrupting things and I [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3069.48s)]
*  Somebody tweeted the exact same thing you tweeted no disrespect to the guy that tweeted me said same thing [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3073.7200000000003s)]
*  Hey, buddy, I think most college athletes are black and then I just tweeted back to him like [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3078.44s)]
*  Not trying to be mean, but I was like, hey buddy [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3083.8s)]
*  I think he just means like he's talking about him as a coach that was saturday [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3085.1600000000003s)]
*  I just casually sent a text didn't make a smart ass comment [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3088.2000000000003s)]
*  My mentions have been on fire for two days with just a bunch of triggered white people being like oh just because he's black [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3091.32s)]
*  You can say this blah blah black people arguing with him. This has become a really divisive thing [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3096.92s)]
*  Deon coaching has become this flash [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3103.08s)]
*  What is the division? I don't understand because he I do think there is something to what he's saying where it's like [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3105.64s)]
*  People don't like this black dude as a coach in a position of authority [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3111.08s)]
*  Talking that shit and then kind of disrupting the way we have things have been for a long time [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3116.04s)]
*  Oh, our coach should be humble a coach should be humble a coach should be hey, let's um, [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3121.08s)]
*  Let's not talk too much. Let's not boast too much [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3126.44s)]
*  Let's not demand respect of ourselves and say things like you need to call me coach and walk out of pro game press conferences [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3128.44s)]
*  And then he's just like i'm gonna be me are they doing the whole like you're disrespecting the game [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3135.24s)]
*  They don't say that necessarily. It's not and I think uh, a lot of the sportscasters talking about it [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3140.12s)]
*  But you've been doing that trying bro. A lot of the sportscasters were just like hey, man [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3145.32s)]
*  I don't think you can make this jump. It's a big jump. That's it [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3149.4s)]
*  But then a lot of the fans I do think are bothered by some of this shit [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3151.72s)]
*  Or at least just maybe there's bots in my tweets, but I've I mean it's been obnoxious [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3155.0800000000004s)]
*  I wouldn't wish I never sent this tweet just trying to clarify for somebody a simple point [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3159.1600000000003s)]
*  You know, I mean like it's become a massive flashpoint [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3164.0400000000004s)]
*  But also you have to watch if you're watching college football, you have to watch colorado [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3166.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, most fun thing in college is here is going to be if dion can do it. Yeah, how far he goes [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3172.36s)]
*  I mean, it's unbelievable. I don't think he can win at all just because he started with a program that had nothing [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3177.32s)]
*  But then not what not only what does he do this year? What does he continue to do? [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3182.92s)]
*  You know what? It kind of reminds me of [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3186.12s)]
*  We are old enough to vaguely remember the fab five [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3188.36s)]
*  Uh, yeah, this feels like the fab five for football [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3191.16s)]
*  Like it's just this new exciting [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3194.68s)]
*  Kind of thing that's more black than what we're used to fab five was michigan's [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3197.56s)]
*  College basketball program that had chris weber jalen rose joan howard joan howard [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3203.3199999999997s)]

*  And then one more and they were all freshmen [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3213.08s)]
*  Yeah, and they made it to the final four. I think the final four lead eight [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3215.24s)]
*  I think the final four jimmy king and maybe the ari jackson and then the next year the uh, the finals I think [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3219.08s)]
*  Or the final four and then chris weber had that [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3224.9199999999996s)]
*  Historic time out where he closed time out where they were out of timeouts and taking free throws [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3227.9599999999996s)]
*  So they end up and they end up losing the game, but they would wear like I mean this is how [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3231.7999999999997s)]
*  Posh college sports were at the time. They wore black socks. Yeah [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3236.92s)]
*  Yeah, and the country was up in arms in black shoes [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3241.08s)]
*  What the hell is going on over here black socks? These guys are so short to their knees [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3244.3599999999997s)]
*  Shorts to their knees. What's going on? But they were just these young kids. They were just absolutely just [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3250.04s)]
*  Crushing it. There's a cool 30 for 30. I think it's a 30 for 30 on it [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3256.2799999999997s)]
*  And uh, obviously jalen rose and chris weber so fucking unbelievably talented joan howard very talented [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3259.3199999999997s)]
*  Like imagine the three of them who went on to have incredible basketball career careers in the pro level [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3264.68s)]
*  Imagine all three of them being on the same team in college [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3269.96s)]
*  So naturally they're gonna go crush and they were just playing the game with a lot of like [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3272.36s)]
*  chutzpah, yeah, you know and uh, okay [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3276.58s)]
*  So that's what's happening right now. I feel like dian is coaching with a lot of chutzpah to say but he must be a great motivator [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3279.16s)]
*  I mean he it was awesome watching him talk to the kids when he was over at jackson state. Yeah, obviously [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3284.12s)]

*  Yeah, he like warns him of what the forgers are doing she'd have worn athletes [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3315.7999999999997s)]
*  This is how we're gonna try to get you just be ready become an informant [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3319.4s)]
*  That's crazy [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3325.8s)]

*  They want to see they're okay with the black man winning if they're doing it in like more of a traditional sense [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3338.36s)]
*  for the pittsburgh steelers head coach, he's like, uh [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3342.92s)]
*  Yeah, super outspoken brash guy he just kind of coaches and wins and the team is always relevant no matter what yeah, we love it [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3345.64s)]

*  Racial as it is. We are kind of used to what we're used to and then anytime somebody fucks with that [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3364.52s)]
*  We're like, I don't like this and to be fair to mike tommy. I don't see him code switching [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3369.48s)]

*  Uh, what's his face? Uh from the patriots, uh, bella check. I feel like [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3383.96s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't mean I know you were trying to say but uh, okay interesting interesting interesting [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3389.56s)]
*  But this is just the fucking internet. Yeah upset at the culture war and using him as a lightning rod [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3393.7999999999997s)]
*  Yes, whatever's going on [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3399.24s)]
*  It is funny to watch people who are really mad at cancel culture still get just as triggered as a cancel culture people [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3400.36s)]
*  Yeah, like you're the same guys. Yeah, you're the same human being did you go back and forth with anyone in your I didn't [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3405.88s)]
*  I thought about tweeting to one guy who was like how did this happen and being like buddy? [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3411.16s)]
*  I have no fucking clue what just went on [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3415.3199999999997s)]
*  But I was like even that's not worth because that's gonna get 20 responses [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3417.0s)]
*  It is just let it breathe for a few days and then it goes away eventually [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3420.2799999999997s)]
*  I need more context in terms of what he said because I don't I don't think saying [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3423.08s)]
*  75 black a team is that [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3427.54s)]
*  Yeah triggering just once you add race to anything to any situation such an easy [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3431.32s)]
*  For people to get and a lot of people will do this if white guy said this it would be blah blah [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3436.92s)]
*  But it's like I don't even know dude. Oh gosh next week. It's uh, Nebraska, Colorado. Who do you have? [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3440.92s)]
*  Oh, I got colorado and it's not it's uh, Nebraska hasn't been good since I was 18. Yeah [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3446.76s)]
*  So yeah, that's a long time ago. All right, my wife was a nine [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3451.48s)]
*  Stop reminding the people I know at the time [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3457.08s)]
*  22 [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3461.32s)]
*  Weird yeah, fresh prince was on last time. Nebraska was good your favorite show. Thank you. Thank you. That's a great [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3463.4s)]
*  Okay, what else we got oh yo nfl starting this week [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3472.04s)]
*  Yeah, you know what? [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3475.32s)]
*  Last year when we did this in england [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3476.6s)]
*  I said I think the chiefs are gonna win the super bowl at the beginning of the year [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3478.04s)]
*  That's what you called it. I switched over to the eagles out of fear because I [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3481.4s)]
*  There was a point in the beginning where you called it yeah, and what do you think in this year? [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3484.28s)]
*  You know who I i'm positive i'm jinxing them right now, but I think the cowboys have a real fucking shot [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3487.4s)]
*  The cowboys have a real fucking shot. Why do you think that this is just the best offseason? [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3493.1600000000003s)]
*  They've had in terms of like making smart trades. They picked up some veteran players to you know, every team has holes [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3497.48s)]
*  It's impossible with a salary cap a hard salary cap in a sport to not have holes and 52 roster spots [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3503.7200000000003s)]
*  But they like filled some of these holes with really like pretty good players and they didn't pay much in terms of draft capital [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3509.48s)]
*  and [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3516.2s)]
*  The eagles are the best team on paper. I just think last year they had such great injury luck like philadelphia eagles [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3517.3199999999997s)]
*  Were so healthy all last year in my brain that has to run out and you have to this year [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3522.92s)]
*  I just can't imagine it's going to be the same way on paper [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3528.2s)]
*  They're the best and what about the quarterback situation for the cowboys the cowboys have dac who I think is [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3530.36s)]
*  Good not he might he's not top five in the league [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3535.24s)]
*  I don't think didn't they trade for trailer and then they traded for trey lance who I think is a developmental piece in a year [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3539.08s)]
*  Or two [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3544.12s)]
*  I think he could be really good or really good enough to get a draft pick back for if dac is still really [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3544.8399999999997s)]
*  But is that a sign that the organization doesn't I don't believe in i think long term [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3549.8799999999997s)]
*  I think it was just a fire sale somebody [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3555.3999999999996s)]
*  Said it well has said you ever just go to costco and there's something that's 90% off and you don't need it [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3558.52s)]
*  But it was an unbelievable deal. They got for him, right? [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3563.16s)]
*  Yeah, this he was the san francisco 49ers third pick in the entire draft [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3565.56s)]
*  They traded three first round picks to get him and then the cowboys got him for one fourth round pick [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3569.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, two full years later for one fourth round pick. So like yeah, let's just take a flyer and see what happens [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3575.0s)]
*  And that's what I think smart teams. That's what the eagles would normally do. So seeing the cowboys do it [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3579.3999999999996s)]
*  I was like hopeful about them. So I think they might actually win it in the nfc [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3583.64s)]
*  AFC I don't know if the chiefs can do it again again. They're the best but yeah, because i'm homes [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3588.52s)]
*  But I think maybe maybe the bangles but I would still probably put my money on the chiefs [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3593.48s)]
*  Yeah, but I um, I do think the cowboys might actually do it this year and i'm probably jinxing them as a fan [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3597.48s)]
*  But like now is this cowboy's delusion in the same way that like cowboy's fan delusion the same way that like nicks fans [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3602.76s)]
*  We're delusional. I'm pretty good about that usually. Yeah, we're not delusional. I don't know what I was talking about [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3608.12s)]
*  Yeah, y'all actually building something as a basketball organization, which really bothers me [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3612.28s)]
*  But i'm usually not delusional about the cowboys i'll buy in for sure but not [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3615.72s)]
*  It's rare. Oh, so this is like real. This is like quietly hopeful [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3620.2s)]
*  I'm saying it, you know here this is the loudest this is the only time I [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3624.3599999999997s)]
*  I can't believe i'm gonna admit this but america could use a cowboy's super bowl win. Absolutely [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3627.8799999999997s)]
*  I and what I mean by that is that like [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3633.72s)]
*  The cowboys whether you like it or not are still america's team [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3637.0s)]
*  And what I mean by that is that there are cowboy fans around the country that have no connection [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3639.64s)]
*  At all to texas when you see yankee fans around the country [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3645.08s)]
*  Their dad's from new york. He moved out to la they were born in new york [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3649.0s)]
*  They moved out that there's yankee fans around the country, but there is some sort of like, um connectivity to new york. Yes [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3653.48s)]
*  charlotte means a cowboy fan [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3659.56s)]
*  The fuck he got to do with dallas. Yeah [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3661.7200000000003s)]
*  His dad don't got nothing to do with dallas, right? [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3664.04s)]
*  I think it was just they were getting so much tv coverage and they were just so successful and exciting team [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3666.28s)]
*  So maybe there needs to be a little bit if the lakers are not good for 20 30 years, it's like what's [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3671.1600000000003s)]
*  We need we could use the lakers. It's good when the massive franchises say what I said [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3677.56s)]
*  They're coming up on that time, but they won a championship in 2020 that kept him relevant [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3682.2000000000003s)]
*  Exactly, and it's good when the big franchises for the sports for the different sports end up winning [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3685.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's good for the sport. Yeah, because they bring out the most interest [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3690.76s)]
*  Yeah, even if I casually if i'm a casual sports fan [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3694.52s)]

*  Yeah, i'm a little more interested to see if they lose i mean with all due respect to kansas city [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3700.44s)]
*  That is the worst thing that could possibly happen for the nfl. The nfl is not thrilled about it [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3704.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that the the team in kansas city wins. Yeah. Yeah, you want the fucking giants to win the jets to win [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3707.96s)]

*  The raiders and raiders doesn't hit as much. Yeah, but just such an iconic franchise steeler [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3721.3999999999996s)]
*  Steelers [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3726.7799999999997s)]
*  How do you pronounce it? I know it's like [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3728.8599999999997s)]
*  Jets are looking good. Did you see hard? No, the jets could be good dude. So yeah, the jets could be good [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3733.02s)]
*  At least it's fun, right? New York. Here's the thing about aaron rogers, too [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3738.62s)]
*  He's hard knocks gas you a little bit [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3742.4599999999996s)]
*  No, but aaron rogers is different because he didn't he didn't give a fuck last year. I don't think he wanted out [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3744.2999999999997s)]
*  Now he cares and he wants to prove something. Yeah, that's the thing. He has to prove that he's that motherfucker [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3749.18s)]
*  And sometimes you need a situation like this to ignite the competitive flame of these guys that are like the true alpha males [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3755.44s)]
*  There's no such thing as a starting quarterback as good as an rogers who doesn't have an insane competitive drive, dude [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3761.76s)]
*  Imagine they don't exist the playoffs for the afc [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3768.32s)]
*  If you're making your picks on price picks, you're not going to know who the fuck to choose. Yes [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3771.44s)]
*  Because it could be aaron rogers joe burrow [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3775.12s)]
*  josh allen patrick mahomes [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3779.12s)]
*  They could all meet these are four of the top five quarterbacks in the league if jalen hertz is top five for philadelphia [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3781.7599999999998s)]
*  In the playoffs if that's your last four teams standing you're just like holy shit. That conference is crazy [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3787.7599999999998s)]
*  Playoffs are going to be crazy on the afc side. Okay. So who you putting your money on? [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3792.88s)]
*  I think i'm gonna have to go kansas city just with prize picks. Yeah [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3797.2799999999997s)]
*  Absolutely with prize picks i'm going kansas city and dallas. I think [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3801.68s)]
*  I think yeah again philadelphia looks the best on paper [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3805.2s)]
*  I just I feel like they have to I just can't see them not getting a bunch of injuries this year and jalen hertz runs [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3809.2799999999997s)]
*  A lot which he's fucking good at and he's a horse, but that's also these are nfl athletes tackling you now [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3814.96s)]
*  Yeah, the other guys run too. Yeah. Yeah, you're randomly right a lot [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3820.72s)]
*  I'd be randomly right. I randomly okay. So what'd you put it down? [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3824.72s)]
*  You said who you said cowboys cowboys and kansas city and I think kansas city would win that [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3827.7599999999998s)]
*  And [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3832.0s)]
*  You know two teams play [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3834.0s)]
*  That's not a bad pick. I think this year is going to be the first year where it's only one [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3837.0400000000004s)]
*  I think this year is going to be the first year where it's only one pick [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3841.1200000000003s)]
*  Only one single team. I think erin's got it dude. I think the jets are going to play the jets [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3844.7200000000003s)]
*  I would love it if the jets won the super bowl against the jets. Yeah, dude [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3850.0800000000004s)]
*  But then the jets would lose there are no losers and there are no winners. Fuck the jets would also lose [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3853.6800000000003s)]
*  And there are no winners fuck the jets would also lose so I would be wrong as well damn it [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3859.28s)]
*  Shit, we're in a real conundrum. We really are here guys. Um [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3865.36s)]
*  Okay, fine i'm gonna go my two picks me personally [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3871.04s)]

*  Dallas [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3884.8s)]
*  It has nothing to do with the fact that I don't know which divisions any of the teams are in and i'll never learn that in my life [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3890.88s)]
*  But I think it's just because that is what my gut was telling me. All right [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3895.2000000000003s)]
*  Well, hey, you can make those picks on prize picks in 60 seconds [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=3899.2000000000003s)]

*  Without some sort of like recourse, especially if you were employed by the cia [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4238.8s)]
*  It just seems mostly to say you're never out of the cia. Yeah, I 100 believe but uh, like really interesting shit [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4241.92s)]
*  And one of the things he said is the cia is specifically looking for personality types [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4247.280000000001s)]
*  it's like kids who have dealt with trauma because you want a certain amount of trauma where you [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4251.04s)]
*  uh become [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4256.56s)]
*  Really competitive because you're looking for outside validation, but not so much trauma that it's broken you and you're gonna hurt yourself [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4258.160000000001s)]
*  Because you never will feel like you will get the validation at all recruit comics. Yeah [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4266.56s)]
*  But I think you see some like athletes that are doing that I think you'll see [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4275.04s)]
*  But it's interesting the cia has kind of worked it out. It's like what would be the best employee? [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4278.88s)]
*  Okay [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4282.4s)]
*  These people who are seeking that external validation and we can curate them and mold them into the people that we need [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4282.8s)]
*  And put the carrot in front of them and the carrot will be like doing good for the company and making sure america is where it needs [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4288.88s)]
*  To be but there are gonna be certain people who are just gonna go. No, fuck. No, i'm not doing that shit [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4294.24s)]
*  I'm not gonna go to this fucking third world country and you know screw up their [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4298.4s)]
*  Military or police systems so we could extract some minerals [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4303.12s)]
*  That's what cops are doing in this example [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4306.08s)]
*  The city's rationale for the long-standing practice is that candidates who score too high could get bored with police work and quit [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4308.0s)]
*  After undergoing costly academic so they do I heard that too [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4313.84s)]
*  That was the reason I got bored and I quit so you know [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4317.599999999999s)]
*  Not for real so they'll do these studies and I imagine they'll find the employees that have stayed there for 30 or what? [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4321.28s)]
*  They're 25 and out 20 and out whatever the whatever it is and uh, and I guarantee they probably found like within [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4326.88s)]
*  two standard deviations of this iq [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4334.0s)]
*  These people stay the longest [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4337.36s)]
*  It's like do we really want to have to retrain and get people up to this next level and have them walking or do we? [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4338.88s)]
*  Want people who'll be here for 25 years? [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4344.96s)]
*  They know the fucking beats they're not going anywhere oh it's between this iq and this iq and this background [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4347.04s)]
*  Block them it that makes sense and it's and the thing that's interesting is [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4352.16s)]
*  We do testing all the time it's not like an awful thing to do there's testing to get into harvard [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4357.6s)]
*  If you don't score high enough on this test, you don't get in right. It's weird when we want you to be bad [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4362.24s)]
*  Yeah, being good. It's like oh, this is an achievement because you want it to be a meritocracy [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4368.4s)]
*  Especially when it comes to policing which is like involves our safety [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4372.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's why it's like well, you don't want the best what the fuck the best and the brightest is the idea behind everything [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4375.36s)]
*  What is the best that's the thing maybe they've figured out that the best is actually not some smart dude who's gonna go [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4380.48s)]
*  I don't like walking down the fucking streets every single day [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4386.4s)]
*  I want to I want to read engineering papers and do something else with my time [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4389.28s)]
*  No, I think they're saying what are the people who are going to stay? [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4393.76s)]
*  It's not about whether they're the best or not. I think the people who score high [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4397.44s)]
*  They're probably great cops, but they're just like hey [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4401.68s)]
*  I don't what what i'm trying to say is that being the part of being the best is staying because if you are the best and leave [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4403.76s)]
*  You're zero. Yeah, yeah, but we tie in intelligence to it because what do they say the best and the brightest? [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4412.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's like that's the colloquialism use well, I want the best and the brightest we kind of tie those two together [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4418.4s)]
*  Yeah, so when we're removing the brightest we're like, well then they can't be the best [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4423.76s)]
*  You see what i'm saying in inside in here we're like well then they're not the best if they're not the brightest is it wrong [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4427.6s)]
*  to discriminate [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4433.52s)]
*  based on [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4435.12s)]
*  intelligence [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4436.96s)]
*  The other way or a lack of intelligence. It's okay to discriminate based on a lack of intelligence [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4438.72s)]
*  Meaning this is how you get a job. This is how you get in school. This is how you uh become part of [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4444.4800000000005s)]
*  uh, I think they decide which uh [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4449.76s)]
*  Section of your branch of the military you go in like if you score really high they're like, oh we need you to be in the [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4452.320000000001s)]
*  um [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4458.08s)]
*  What is it called? [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4459.280000000001s)]
*  intelligence sector, whatever so [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4460.8s)]
*  Is it if that's okay [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4465.4400000000005s)]
*  Why is it wrong to discriminate based on too high intellect? [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4468.320000000001s)]
*  Why is it wrong to beg up? [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4472.64s)]
*  So you score too high on this test if it's okay to do with people that score low [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4473.6s)]
*  Why can't we do with people score high? [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4477.4400000000005s)]
*  I think the assumptions at the threshold is that if you're past the point you could go down [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4478.8s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like oh you're too smart to be a garbage man. It's like [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4482.64s)]
*  You would do it the inverse way because you're not smart enough to do a hard job [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4486.16s)]
*  But if you are smart, you can do an easier job [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4488.8s)]
*  You know what i'm saying? Like I have the skill set but what if they've proven or some economists that did this study proves that like [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4490.8s)]
*  They actually can't right now what they need more stimulus and because they need more stimulus for whatever reason they do the job worse [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4496.64s)]
*  That would be the counterintuitive and so to most people they're like, yeah, it's wrong that you can't go down [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4503.28s)]
*  So we're just looking at it that as like layman's but the reality is if you do the research they actually do a worse job [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4508.32s)]
*  Companies will say you're overqualified for this job and they're like people will be like, what are you fucking talking about? [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4515.12s)]
*  I'm overqualified the company's like well, this is the best [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4519.92s)]
*  We need people that have these qualifications because you're gonna get bored with it. It's the same idea [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4522.639999999999s)]
*  But that guy's like yo, I need a fucking job. I will do this. I promise [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4526.32s)]
*  Yeah, and to that guy it's like I can't eat because i'm too good [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4530.4s)]
*  Yeah, I can't feed my family because i'm too good but we're looking at as good you're not good enough for the job [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4534.64s)]
*  The good yeah, iq range right here is is what is good for the job and you're right [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4540.32s)]
*  Exactly. It's the person's gonna stay the person's gonna enjoy [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4545.92s)]
*  I guess their job and the person's gonna like put that love and affection into it [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4548.96s)]
*  And I guess they see at this iq range they they think they're over it [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4552.96s)]
*  I guess the part that's in congress is like they're talking about your long-term desire to stay at this job [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4556.24s)]
*  And that smart person's short-term desire is like yo, no my desire is I want to be here [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4560.4s)]
*  You're telling me I won't want to i'm telling you I do [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4565.84s)]
*  So we side with that person. We're like, yo, he wants to be here. What are you talking about based on probabilities? [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4568.48s)]
*  He won't bro. I wonder if like they see this happening with cops where [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4572.5599999999995s)]
*  Okay, you're a cop. You're in a position of power, right in authority and uh [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4576.5599999999995s)]
*  The the smart cops start realizing oh with my power and authority I could probably do some other businesses that [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4582.4s)]
*  Somewhat rely on this power and authority [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4588.719999999999s)]
*  Okay, I could probably do personal protection of people on my time off and I think maybe some in new york [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4590.719999999999s)]
*  I don't know if they allow the cops to do that on the side [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4595.76s)]
*  Like I don't know if you're allowed to be like a private [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4597.679999999999s)]
*  Usually after if you once you retire once you retire you can't but not during so then I wonder some of the cops like [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4599.76s)]
*  All right. Well, I what i'll do is i'll have a private security agency [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4605.12s)]
*  Well, I have all my retired buddies all working for me doing private security and now you got four or five six other hustles [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4609.04s)]
*  going on while you're a cop and [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4615.44s)]
*  If you're the chief you're like, all right, this guy's stretched them because he's already working 40 hours a week on this other stuff [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4618.4s)]
*  He's sleeping on the job or he's not taking this shit that seriously [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4624.16s)]
*  He's not chasing that that perp because he's got all these other things that are making him the real money [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4626.5599999999995s)]
*  I wonder if that's where things are going you're like, okay [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4631.84s)]
*  These really ambitious and industrious people aren't going to take this job seriously and and we really need them to take it seriously [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4634.08s)]
*  I like the idea of uh, discriminating based on intelligence being too smart. I like that [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4640.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4646.0s)]
*  You've done it with women your whole life besides the one you're with now. This is the first smart woman you dated [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4647.68s)]
*  You discriminated on intelligence for your whole life. Think about that. You see chifty. That's why you get engaged [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4653.84s)]
*  50 not even here [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4659.84s)]
*  I was so tired. I was looking into that like that was my thing like he was there. That's my single [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4664.4800000000005s)]
*  I was looking the wrong side for my single. Oh my god. That is impressive. Um [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4670.32s)]
*  You're telling me you weren't looking at chifty [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4675.52s)]
*  No, I was thinking his camera was gonna be on me and he's not even there and I saw he wasn't there and I was like [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4677.76s)]
*  But i'm still looking there [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4683.52s)]
*  It'll move it'll move [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4685.2s)]
*  That's all right. It's impressive [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4687.6s)]
*  I don't even know what's happening. We might need to do age limits for the pond dude [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4689.6s)]
*  We might honestly we might even have an age cut off for this show. Okay. Um [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4692.4800000000005s)]

*  And I think it pretty quickly is determined that it's not her [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4723.52s)]
*  Yeah, the woman in the video has tattoos that she does not have wasn't that quick to determine that you had to watch it a couple [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4727.36s)]
*  Done. Did you is that what you do? Yeah, yo, the dude does a fire move in the video [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=4733.6s)]

*  No, no, because you're an alien if you [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=5322.320000000001s)]

*  we [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=5328.56s)]
*  Would just be humans. We'd just be people. We'd just be whatever we are. They would be the aliens [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=5329.84s)]
*  They could be like illegal alien [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=5333.76s)]
*  Well, they would name you they would name us as winners because they're just like y'all named us indians when you came over [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=5335.68s)]
*  They're gonna come over and name us. What do we want to their movies look like? [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=5341.200000000001s)]

*  If I had to bet [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=5386.400000000001s)]
*  I don't think we would even understand them. Who knows? [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=5387.76s)]
*  And we would probably look crazy because we assume aliens look weird what if that's just an outfit they're wearing we assume that they're naked [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=5390.64s)]

*  But it's actually just the helmet that we're wearing the whole time. Keep going the real aliens are inside the alien, bro [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=5402.08s)]

*  When you just start saying something [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=5427.040000000001s)]

*  Anyway, I wonder how much longer I can linger this [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6014.0s)]
*  Date read I wonder if people have even skipped [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6017.599999999999s)]
*  You know who else lingers people that might want to suck your dick after a comedy show [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6020.320000000001s)]
*  This idea is starting to grow on me [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6025.92s)]
*  You know what else grows back to the show the youtuber foosie tube. Yes has been arrested and hospitalized. Yes [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6028.4800000000005s)]
*  It's very sad. Yeah, bro. This was sad to watch I felt it's so entertaining. It's unbelievable. It's crazy [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6035.84s)]
*  Why is it sad to watch? He's watching this guy fall apart. Who was this guy? [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6040.8s)]
*  So he's a very popular youtuber that then became a very popular streamer slash youtuber [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6044.719999999999s)]
*  And has recently been doing a subathon where he's just streaming non-stop. You've probably seen clips of him [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6050.08s)]
*  They've been popping up everywhere car crash car crash car crash [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6054.16s)]
*  So let's put it the best way like every single interaction he's having with people on the subathon is just how do I turn this into? [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6057.36s)]
*  a train wreck [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6062.639999999999s)]
*  so and so my question is why do you feel bad for somebody who's [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6063.84s)]
*  Intentionally trying to do this because people have started to suspect that he is just truly going insane [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6067.74s)]
*  Yeah, that he's having like a mental health crisis and as a result [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6073.28s)]
*  He was baker acted in Miami where he was doing a subathon and was arrested live on camera [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6076.16s)]
*  I feel like you have to be [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6080.4s)]
*  Saying at some level to like, uh every interaction. Let me make it a moment [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6082.88s)]
*  So this is what he was eventually arrested for [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6087.68s)]
*  uh [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6090.16s)]
*  After so basically he calls 911 and tells him that he's in a hostage situation [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6091.44s)]
*  He has a gun to his head even though that wasn't the case after spending some time convinced of the dispatcher [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6096.16s)]
*  This life was indeed in danger four police officers showed up to his hotel room [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6099.92s)]
*  Then he claimed that his mother was in danger and someone was calling and threatening her [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6103.12s)]
*  And then he's been talking about that. He has a stalker that people are following him [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6106.8s)]
*  He's been like displaying signs of paranoia. He's just like making up shit [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6109.68s)]
*  Well, there's also another streamer that does is talking to him and is calling him and telling him like I know where you're at [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6113.52s)]
*  Yeah, yada yada like da da da da so then he calls and he says i'm gonna ruin your life [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6119.28s)]
*  Like he calls the cops on himself in a weird way. It's hard to tell what's real and what's not [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6123.68s)]
*  And all of this is exaggerated to get the cops there quicker. Yes very much so [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6127.36s)]
*  I think you gotta look at it like this. It's like in the streaming world [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6131.759999999999s)]
*  The the currency is really the amount of people that are watching your stream, right? [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6135.679999999999s)]
*  So it's like how do you maintain those people watching? [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6140.48s)]
*  So it's like it's you have 10 000 people watching. How do you make sure those 10 000 people don't tune out? [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6143.679999999999s)]
*  You have to have a car crash every single second and what he was doing is I think he was doing like a live stream [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6149.2s)]
*  Throughout the entire day so he would just be filming himself constantly multiple days in irl live stream [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6154.48s)]
*  There's a few of these guys doing it like yeah [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6160.0s)]
*  And he became the biggest doing the subathon though. Yes, so that he's doing a subathon also streaming non-stop [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6164.0s)]
*  So I would see like people would clip his stuff and they put it up on instagram [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6168.88s)]
*  They put it up on youtube and center so i'd see all these fucking clips and there's no question [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6172.16s)]
*  It was so unbelievably entertaining. I mean like every single fucking moment and granted i'm seeing the clips [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6176.4s)]
*  So i'm seeing the most wild shit [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6181.76s)]
*  But it's just every interaction is heated emotional response to every single thing [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6183.76s)]
*  It's like the reason why I laugh so much at dove when we're just hanging out is everything is at 10 [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6190.4800000000005s)]
*  With the emotional reaction you leave a cup out here with some juice in it. You don't throw it away [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6196.0s)]
*  He doesn't come to you at a five like hey, can you throw away your cup? [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6200.16s)]
*  It's i'm not going to call the cleaning lady at all until everybody agrees to clean up their cups. This is fucking ridiculous [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6203.68s)]
*  We're gonna get roaches. We're gonna get bugs. I'm gonna get some sort of disease. I won't be able to see my family [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6209.68s)]
*  I'll never be able to see my family again. And if it's that's that is this guy [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6213.68s)]
*  On a million on every single interaction. Yeah, and he is producing it day after day after day now [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6218.08s)]
*  I don't know what it takes in order to give that type of energy. Do you need [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6225.12s)]
*  A substance do you naturally produce that and you need a substance to take you down like some people who are manic? [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6229.6s)]
*  Can naturally produce those moments. Yeah, but the cost is eventually you have to pay that debt, right? [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6236.8s)]
*  You're taking a debt. I assume either substance or mental illness to keep it going at that high of a level at all times [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6241.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting like if I know [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6247.28s)]
*  If you if he knows that there's a reward to these interactions, it's like hey, I just gotta act up like to me [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6250.72s)]
*  That's the most sane [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6257.68s)]
*  If you know, oh, I just gotta yell and be erratic every time I say people still have a line people online [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6259.44s)]
*  No, no, like if you walked around naked all over time square and did a subathon [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6265.679999999999s)]
*  You know you could get whatever the fuck make millions out you're not gonna do it [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6269.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but as I think now we're talking about like where people's morals are and what they're willing to do to [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6272.879999999999s)]
*  I would I would say it's not just morals. There's also sanity involved [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6278.48s)]
*  I think that I think there's enough sanity that he's aware. Yeah, and I think that they're [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6283.12s)]
*  This is the same guy who thinks you never got the flu ever in your life and you just missed days [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6289.599999999999s)]
*  Well, well, well that's a good ass point I mean [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6293.12s)]
*  I'm doubting doubting my book. There is enough sanity where he's aware of what it leads to the success [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6296.8s)]
*  And then there is enough [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6304.32s)]
*  I want to call insanity [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6306.4800000000005s)]
*  But there is he's missing enough of something that allows him to be way more shameless than the average person would [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6308.4800000000005s)]
*  Now does he get there with drugs? Does he get there with some sort of mental illness? How does he get there? [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6315.68s)]
*  I don't know but the average person would feel [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6320.4s)]
*  Some sort of shame in the situations that he's putting himself in and maybe when he's saying he doesn't feel that shame [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6324.24s)]
*  Or maybe when he's not on the drug, he doesn't feel that shame or maybe when he is taking his meds [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6330.08s)]
*  He doesn't feel that shame but I think that naturally as human beings behaving in a way that would ostracize the group [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6334.48s)]
*  Usually evokes some sort of like uh, uneasy disposition in ourselves, right? That's why we feel guilt. That's why we feel awkwardness [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6341.28s)]
*  That's why they feel discomfort, right? [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6348.32s)]
*  and uh [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6350.5599999999995s)]
*  It's appearing as if he doesn't feel it and that's why it's so hard to look away because you're like [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6351.44s)]
*  How could someone be so comfortable in this situation that would make me feel so desperately uncomfortable? [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6355.92s)]
*  and [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6362.08s)]
*  For a streamer [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6363.2s)]
*  That is perfection because I can't take my eyes away from the guy doing the thing that I would never want to do [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6364.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, in a purely objective sense entertainment only I mean if it is if you look at speed [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6370.719999999999s)]
*  He's incredibly good at this as well, you know like barking at somebody now. He's aware [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6376.72s)]
*  He's aware of what he's doing. I believe at least he's aware of what he's doing [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6381.84s)]
*  But he also knows that if I behave in a way that isn't congruent to just normal social practices [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6386.0s)]
*  It's going to draw eyeballs. Yeah, and what's interesting about him is that [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6392.240000000001s)]
*  Now people expect that behavior. So it reduces the awkwardness. It was more awkward in the beginning, right? [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6396.88s)]
*  When people thought that he was [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6403.36s)]
*  Just this absolute maniac now. They're like hey you do that funny thing where you act in like an awkward way [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6405.44s)]
*  Can you do that? [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6411.76s)]
*  So I wonder if now it's even easier for him to play up the character [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6412.96s)]
*  Because it's the the expectation is set now. You're not being awkward. You're being speed and we love it when you do that [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6418.08s)]
*  so could this be a [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6423.36s)]
*  like a [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6425.6s)]
*  A situation where Fousy's Fousy Fousy Fousy Fousy. Sorry. He's trying to find his line [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6426.96s)]
*  Yeah, Fousy was accused of similar behavior. Yeah, I mean [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6433.44s)]
*  But is he trying to find his [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6437.6s)]
*  Do you remember when he had that mental episode where he told everyone two weeks of flat on the curb [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6442.56s)]
*  Remember that when he had this breakdown [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6448.0s)]
*  In dc, but do you think he's maybe trying to find his line like how speed has [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6450.0s)]
*  The character and the and insanity are ball in one at this point. I think yeah, maybe that's the point [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6455.76s)]
*  He's been an online personality for a while, but that's the thing [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6460.56s)]
*  He didn't he have a lot of success and then went away for a while [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6463.84s)]
*  And I'm trying to gain it back and he doesn't really know how to gain it back and then he's like, oh this is working [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6467.6s)]
*  Let me lean in I think that [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6471.76s)]
*  I think what I would say the one difference between like him and like a speed is [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6474.240000000001s)]
*  It's very evident that speed is behaving in a manner [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6478.0s)]
*  That is not congruent with normal practices for human beings [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6482.4800000000005s)]
*  and [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6487.04s)]
*  Fousy [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6488.320000000001s)]
*  It doesn't seem like he's aware of it. Yeah [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6490.88s)]
*  Like really even whether he is or not is is left to be, you know [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6494.0s)]
*  Known right like we have a conversation with him and if he goes, yeah, dude, I was just running it up [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6498.160000000001s)]
*  It was crazy like everybody was watching I took over the fucking internet in five days [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6501.92s)]
*  So I had to keep on taking to another level another level another level [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6505.360000000001s)]
*  It's like an only fans girl [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6508.320000000001s)]
*  You start by showing the titties and then three months later in order to keep the only fans you get fucked in your ass [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6509.280000000001s)]
*  So starting out with one thing and heightening and heightening and heightening it [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6513.76s)]
*  So maybe he has that conversation with us but for for speed for me [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6517.599999999999s)]
*  At least whenever i've watched some stuff i'm always like, oh this guy knows that this is ridiculous [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6521.44s)]
*  And if we're off camera, he'd be like dude [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6526.08s)]
*  I'm just gonna dive into my laptop because it's such a ridiculous thing to do [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6528.4s)]
*  I think people will just laugh in a clip about and that's what I thought. I also think speed [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6532.16s)]
*  That's what you thought he was. That's what I thought [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6535.92s)]
*  I also think speed wouldn't do a 30-day subathon all the time because he turns it on and off he picks his spots [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6537.2s)]
*  He's not doing that all the time [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6542.5599999999995s)]
*  And he you know what I mean like as a sane person he needs he's gonna be really [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6544.16s)]
*  He's probably really quiet when he's not these numbers are up. So he maybe doesn't have the need to do a subathon [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6547.76s)]
*  Fousey's trying to get his shit back right there. I think even I don't think speed would do a subathon because he just [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6553.44s)]
*  Yeah [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6560.08s)]
*  Yeah, uh, it's similar. You can just watch the video. It seems very like [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6560.88s)]
*  He's not aware [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6566.48s)]
*  That he's maybe in a mental health crisis. Yeah, is he acting crazy or is he crazy? [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6568.0s)]
*  And it's hard to discern and that's what the police arrested him for is basically to figure that out [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6572.639999999999s)]
*  And that's also why he's so incredible at it because you don't know [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6576.08s)]
*  Like you're like fuck am I watching somebody who's crazy or am I watching? [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6581.04s)]
*  The greatest magician ever and the cops have showed up to speed before and the cameras go off [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6585.44s)]
*  I'm sure speed is like y'all doing a thing. I'm sorry. I'll cool off and then he doesn't get arrested [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6590.0s)]
*  But the fact that he got arrested is like, um, he never turned the act off which means it's not an act [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6595.5199999999995s)]
*  I think the act was different like he called the cops saying somebody's holding a gun to my head. That's a false. Um, [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6600.16s)]
*  Whatever like that's actually a crime. So they had to but when the cops show up he doesn't calm down and go no guys [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6608.24s)]
*  You don't know he just is fully still in the in the moment. Yeah [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6614.32s)]
*  But that's really the fact that I think one way and you guys think another way is like this is why you can't stop watching [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6619.12s)]
*  You just can't stop watching now. The question is is [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6625.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, if you live in New York, you can watch this for free you don't even have to stream it you can just go on the train [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6628.8s)]
*  Don't you ever disagree? [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6635.68s)]
*  We're saying it's the most entertaining city for which I wrote it just make sure [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6638.8s)]
*  Go to like the the Lower East Side 3 a.m. And just hang out and you will see [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6643.28s)]

*  Woman tries to bump into me. You don't think that what would you do with the knife? I mean that sincerely [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6662.32s)]
*  Say try to just somewhere on the train. Go ahead [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6667.44s)]
*  um [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6670.16s)]
*  He just wants to show it. No, I don't even think that I don't even think he would show it [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6671.28s)]
*  He'd be like tell us a story. Can I suggest something else? I wanted to take out my knife. No, no [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6676.0s)]

*  He took you down. No, that don't even scare me that it looks like that little [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6699.92s)]
*  Yeah, could I cut a pair of these skin an apple? [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6703.4400000000005s)]
*  That's not doing no damage [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6706.8s)]
*  What do you mean? I said he really looked it up because he knows like four uh, four inches [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6709.12s)]
*  Anything longer? Yeah [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6713.36s)]

*  I'm trying to stop criminals. I'm doing nothing. That's just something [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6720.16s)]
*  Mace [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6723.44s)]
*  Yeah, nice. I know it's embarrassing because it's for like women or whatever, but it is the most effective tool for [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6724.4s)]
*  Protecting yourself. Thank god cargo shorts are ended. Okay, so many pockets so many pockets [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6731.82s)]
*  I'm gonna carry all the self-defense equipment. I got no bullshit like [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6736.96s)]
*  I think the thing about having a knife which is so terrifying is uh, nobody by defending yourself through that action [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6741.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's like that's a scary action shooting someone's easier. It's easier to shoot than that [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6748.0s)]
*  But so you're carrying this for no reason if I have to do that to protect my car like this [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6752.799999999999s)]
*  And then they're gonna come at you and you're gonna be like dog. You got me distance six feet away with mace [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6756.4s)]

*  Before you brought out the knife you just can't beat up and getting your wallet taken not a sharp knife [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6769.120000000001s)]
*  This is charles and whites greatest service as to humanity is letting men use mace. Yeah, that's the best thing he's done mace [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6773.200000000001s)]
*  That's actually a good idea have a fake knife pretend to drop it mace [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6778.96s)]
*  He grabs the fake knife and then when he stabs me it actually has a blade comes out the other side [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6783.4400000000005s)]
*  It looks like a knife [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6787.04s)]
*  Just get a mace can that looks like a knife so you feel like that's a bitch or mace little button gun [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6789.92s)]

*  That actually be so sick, dude. Yeah, it is then everyone wins. That's kind of hard. I like that. I like that [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6797.84s)]
*  That is that from the part that they know [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6803.5199999999995s)]
*  That's actually kind of tough that is fire, but that's gonna get so many people killed [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6805.68s)]
*  Yeah, because you're gonna pull out your mace gun and the other person's like, oh shit. He got a gun [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6810.08s)]
*  I gotta pull out my gun and he's gonna shoot you but if you shoot first that motherfucking I get in his real gun [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6813.92s)]

*  No, you are so looks like you're stranded on an island. You want a fucking plane to come rescue [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6840.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's what i'm saying dude. Like if you pull that out someone pulls it out on you on the train. You're not a little afraid [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6844.88s)]
*  Of the whole thing you pull it out you got it you you got to spray [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6850.24s)]
*  Yeah, this is not this is not let your shit off because you're not killing it [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6853.76s)]
*  Their eyes i'll be honest [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6857.12s)]
*  I don't think you got to let it out. You got to you have to why not the reason why you don't have to is I think [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6859.68s)]
*  displaying it [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6864.96s)]
*  If that person has been maced before they're not coming near you [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6866.8s)]
*  If they haven't [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6871.5199999999995s)]
*  They're not coming near you [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6873.84s)]

*  I think showing the mace is going to be very similar to gun that knife shit. You're fucked [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6882.16s)]
*  You're fucked. I thought we were talking about this mace gun, but if you're talking about mace [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=6887.76s)]

*  And then she was like I'll cover and then she kind of told the coach that like there was a family emergency [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=7528.16s)]
*  And that we had to leave at a certain time and I got his attention and that we had to go and then he left [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=7535.5199999999995s)]
*  And then he heard that some kid shit all over the floor [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=7539.839999999999s)]
*  You believe that your jersey was left there with the number on the back of it, yeah [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=7542.32s)]

*  So my mom didn't lie. Yeah, my son should have said the truth [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=7617.280000000001s)]

*  You know what I mean? Yeah, because you kept it moving. Well, I went to my friend's house [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=7663.76s)]
*  It was like right off the block and I went to his bathroom and I didn't flush my underwear [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=7666.639999999999s)]
*  I fucked up there [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=7670.4s)]
*  I wrapped the shit that was left in the underwear and I just put it in their garbage in the bathroom [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=7671.599999999999s)]
*  And they called my parents and they were like did Andrew shit his underwear and then leave it [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPFQSzuqBWs&t=7676.48s)]
