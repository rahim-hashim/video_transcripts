# LA Fires: Why No One Seems to Care & Whoâ€™s Really to Blame
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI)
*  What's up everybody welcome to Flaygrant today we're gonna get to the bottom why Mark believes everything. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=0.0s)]
*  Mark just three seconds ago was telling us why demons exist and your proof was the Jews. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4.32s)]
*  Religious people believe in demons, Dove believes in demons. Let the record show you're a religious [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Jew you go to synagogue every day and according to Jewish religion you have to believe that there's [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=14.88s)]
*  good and evil. And that the evil are demons. Sure. Okay Mark I've learned from communicating with my wife [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=18.64s)]
*  okay that giving examples is not what they want okay examples undermine what they feel [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=24.08s)]
*  and they just want their feelings validated. Now my whole life has been dedicated towards creating [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=32.4s)]
*  metaphors and analogies for why I'm right. Turns out that's horrible for communication [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=37.2s)]
*  also interrupting apparently horrible. I'm like is it my wife that's commenting on the YouTube? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=42.0s)]
*  You gotta call it heckling. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=46.8s)]
*  Do people not have friends? I'm like what do you do with your friends? You don't just talk over [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=55.36s)]
*  each other that's just how friendship fucking works. That's how it's supposed to go. You want [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=59.28s)]
*  to say something you just say it. Yeah. Done. Except for when she interrupts you. Disrespectful [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=63.76s)]
*  come on a man is talking here a male embryo the embryo that was wanted and desired and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=70.56s)]
*  cherished around the world. Yes. Okay anyways Mark Mark Mark believes in anything we figured out why [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=78.64s)]
*  Mark believes in anything can you share? I believe in I give leashes to things okay I don't just [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=85.52s)]
*  believe I just don't believe in anything. Okay Mark heard so much absurd shit growing up from his mom. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  Obviously right so his barometer for what is normal and weird is way off. Yeah yeah yeah. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=94.8s)]
*  We end up a normal great way to start your morning. We haven't even gotten to the bottom of that have [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=101.52s)]
*  we? So hold on she's just backing up into the Nespresso every morning? Yeah well it's put into [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=106.64s)]
*  like a like a canteen. Oh she doesn't go right from the tap. She doesn't just tip that thing off. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=115.2s)]
*  No you gotta cool it down you gotta cool it down make it room temp and then put it in the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=120.48s)]
*  in the little container and then tube it up. Got it. She doesn't go for ice cold thing you know. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=124.0s)]
*  Refreshing wakes up. It's room temp. What does that do to a demon? Okay listen she knows that. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=129.76s)]
*  Okay okay so all right so Mark has gives a little bit longer leash to all the crazy people right. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Now I'm not saying the mom's crazy but she has some wild ideas and you would hear this. Some [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=141.84s)]
*  of the ideas are certainly kind of crazy. And then some of the ideas end up kind of being right. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=145.36s)]
*  So where the average person like us if somebody just walks up to us on the street and they're [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=149.2s)]
*  like bacon is uh uh uh uh fucking is really from pigeon or whatever like that we go all right [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=153.2s)]
*  whatever you're just a crazy person. There's a little bit of you that goes what do you mean by [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=161.11999999999998s)]
*  that? Yeah well why there's certainly a follow-up question and I thought everyone had follow-up [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  question. No. We walk away. Yeah you're engaged crazies. But here's the thing normally someone [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=171.12s)]
*  with Mark's condition would go to an island somewhere where there are people that are [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=177.76s)]
*  relaxed and calm and they don't believe in crazy shit and then they would just live out the rest [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  of their life in tranquility and peace. Yeah. No he went to the place where there are normal people [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=184.48s)]
*  screaming out crazy shit all day long and now he has to inquire about this. Yes. Thousand percent [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=189.12s)]
*  started a podcast about it. Yeah literally yes that's where this combo came from because I was [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=194.48s)]
*  talking to a guy that was telling me about aliens and I was like yo maybe dude they're so convicted [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=199.04s)]
*  tell me about aliens. Has there ever been a moment in your life where you just go [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=204.48s)]
*  ugh I don't believe that. Sure. Yeah when someone said you should enjoy movies. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=208.32s)]
*  You're like I don't believe that. So I watched Wicked and I was like I don't know. Too many people [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  and do that every single day. It seems too far from me. I'm not gonna watch movies. Shower daily. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=217.6s)]
*  Yeah I mean that's a that's a myth that's for the record that is absolutely a propaganda tool [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=223.76s)]
*  done by a capitalist America. Yes. By the Resnicks. Yeah by the fucking Resnicks. Yeah in fucking [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=228.72s)]
*  California's if you were washing yourself all day your city would be there. Consume more buy more [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=233.84s)]
*  that's what happens bro people shower all the time. Yeah. I was counting down the minutes until they [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=239.2s)]
*  blamed it on the Jews the wildfire. I was kept looking at TikTok I was like man you guys are [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  taking a little while and then boom where's all the water in California and some fucking Star Boys [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=248.8s)]
*  house in northern LA where were the Resnicks. I think Northern California. I'm gonna have all of it [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=254.0s)]
*  though anyway. Okay so. Yeah I give I give a little bit of a leash. Yeah. Okay but then some things [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=260.4s)]
*  like Flat Earth that's not true. But you would give us a leash to believe it. It had to be proven. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=266.0s)]
*  I was like. Just enough for me to walk off the face of the planet. Yeah it had to be proven to you that [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=272.32s)]
*  it wasn't true where the rest of us were like we know it's not true. But how do you know it's not [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=276.88s)]
*  true. Because. Exactly. Because. Can I tell you something. Exactly. Because. Because. No you look into it you say okay the light can't go through the hole. Didn't even look into it. Because the curvature. Didn't even look into it. I just said ah it's not flat. But when you're in an airplane you look out and you go it seems flat. Don't even think about it. No it doesn't seem flat. I don't even think about it in an airplane I'm like man we're going around. Around. Not flat at all. Not flat at all. I agree. But you think that it's flat. It's not flat. It could be. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=280.64s)]
*  He gives a leash to the idea. You give a leash to the idea that it's flat. Well it is it is measurably flat in our existence on the earth. The glass is thick on the airplane so it makes it look round from our POV on the plane. I get it. It's experientially flat but it's not actually flat in actuality. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=310.88s)]
*  That's true. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=329.84s)]
*  I wish he was sick. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=331.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=333.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm sick. I'm getting more sick listening to this shit. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=335.03999999999996s)]
*  Akash almost died this week. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=337.44s)]
*  So did Al. I gave it to him. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=339.52s)]
*  I got the Akash bird flu. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=341.48s)]
*  I did tell you not to hug me. Al wanted to hug everybody. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=343.68s)]

*  Nobody cares about your little fucking pneumonia. Akash was like oh pneumonia. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=352.6s)]
*  I didn't think I'm the real victim. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  You are the real victim. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=357.92s)]
*  Can you share what you're saying about the wildfires? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=358.84s)]

*  I've been trying to figure that out to be honest with you. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=433.68s)]
*  Like when is the time when you start. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=435.64s)]
*  One of the first questions I asked Jason. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=436.52s)]
*  I was like how quickly are y'all going to buy up this dirt? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=439.32s)]
*  And he was like and this is what he said he goes it's uninsurable. Not worth it. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=442.44s)]
*  And that is going to be the issue is it now that there are wildfires that run through every year or whatever it is and you don't know when this kind of stuff is going to happen the insurance companies are going to go ah it's not worth it. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=446.2s)]
*  And then the only people can buy the homes of the people who can buy them all cash and self insure. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=456.84s)]
*  I mean. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=462.96s)]
*  So housing prices. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=463.6s)]
*  Or it becomes an affordable area because the fair plan only insures up to three million dollars. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=464.6s)]
*  Oh is that like the government's natural disaster insurance? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=470.72s)]
*  That's when because they were canceling State Farm other plans so you only had the fair plan plus like little other umbrellas you could have done but if that's your cap. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=473.04s)]
*  What if you just buy land and wait for California or for LA to go Republican. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=483.08s)]
*  Now we're going to be fine. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=486.76s)]
*  Once these people start because a lot of these people whose houses are gone like they never built a house they maybe renovated one a little bit or they bought an existing house. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=488.36s)]
*  Once you start building a house in California you deal with the bureaucracy that is in place all these people are going to go man fuck the Democrats. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=496.92s)]
*  Fuck leftist shit like open it up turn this shit into Texas or Florida. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=510.56s)]
*  Let me do it. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=514.36s)]
*  I don't think they're going to streamline the shit because there's so many. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=514.64s)]
*  So here's the thing if you if it's now OK to streamline why the fuck was there a streamline before. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=517.44s)]
*  Why are you having up all these people. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=523.5600000000001s)]
*  No I mean in terms of building back like they will have less regulations just because we have to build this shit back. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=525.1999999999999s)]
*  OK so then they will and then people realize oh wow the housing shortage goes away quickly when you actually make it possible for people to build out here. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=531.76s)]
*  So either way I think the people start going all right I think we're done with the leftist policies. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=539.04s)]
*  Yeah progressive is dead. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=543.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah yeah yeah. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=544.64s)]
*  And then after this fire does that not mean that there won't be another fire for a while. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=546.24s)]
*  Like if this is basically a controlled burn that took down all of like the brush and shit does that by 10 years. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=550.24s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=555.68s)]
*  It's like the worst fire that's ever happened. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=556.28s)]
*  I feel like brush grows like that. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=557.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=559.92s)]
*  How fast is brush. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=560.8399999999999s)]
*  What's brush. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=563.3199999999999s)]
*  It's brush. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=563.92s)]
*  It's brush. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=564.8s)]
*  It's like it's dry. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=565.4s)]
*  Brush. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=566.36s)]
*  It grows like that. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=566.64s)]
*  It's the leaves. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=568.0799999999999s)]
*  It was brush. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=568.56s)]
*  It was 80 to 100 mile per hour wind was the perfect direction. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=569.12s)]
*  It was just an absolute nightmare. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=572.88s)]
*  Perfect shit attack. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=574.7199999999999s)]
*  Manmade bro. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=576.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=577.56s)]
*  I mean there were people like shit up. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=578.0799999999999s)]
*  But that's the other thing that's like the reaction to this. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=579.72s)]
*  It's funny like the Luigi Mangione stuff. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=583.0400000000001s)]
*  The reaction was people like supportive of Luigi Mangione. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=585.5200000000001s)]
*  And some people made it about him being good looking. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=590.9200000000001s)]
*  I don't think it was about him being good looking. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=594.12s)]
*  No. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=595.6400000000001s)]
*  At all. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=596.0s)]
*  It helps. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=596.6s)]
*  It helps because it's a little funnier to support it because you can pretend you're doing it because he's so handsome. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=597.4000000000001s)]
*  But like the undercurrent is really fuck that evil CEO. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=602.88s)]
*  They're the haves. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=606.7600000000001s)]
*  I'm the have not. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=607.96s)]
*  We've all been fucked by insurance and this is health insurance. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=608.88s)]
*  So it's life and death. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=612.2800000000001s)]
*  They play with your life. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=613.08s)]
*  Same thing with this housing shit. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=614.32s)]
*  Housing insurance companies are going to try to not pay out all these people. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=615.8000000000001s)]
*  CEOs better get fucking secured. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=618.96s)]
*  Yo that was one of your texts like right as it was happening. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=620.6800000000001s)]
*  And if another if a house like a state farm insurance CEO gets aced out you think people are going to give a fuck. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=623.1600000000001s)]
*  We're not going to give a fuck. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=629.64s)]
*  We're going to be like that's what's up. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=630.88s)]
*  There you go. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=631.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=632.8000000000001s)]
*  This is this is like I think we talked about this before but you know for the billionaire class right. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=633.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=638.96s)]
*  Or the hundreds of millionaires like the people who actually kind of control things and make decisions. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=639.24s)]
*  Throughout history you got to make sure that the poorest people have enough to live. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=645.2s)]
*  They can't be below the poverty line because if they're below the poverty line with no hope like they feel like there's no way out. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=653.5600000000001s)]
*  They're going to kill you. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=659.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=660.88s)]
*  And that's history right. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=661.5600000000001s)]
*  This is every revolution has started because of that. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=662.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=665.52s)]
*  So I think what you're seeing right now is there are a lot of people below the poverty line. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=665.8399999999999s)]
*  They feel no hope whatsoever and they're maybe not going out and killing the CEO but they are celebrating it or having zero empathy for it. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=669.7199999999999s)]
*  And unfortunately with the fires the way that the media has portrayed it is it's just kind of Malibu in the palisades and every time you turn on fucking Fox or CNN they're like this famous person's house burned out. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=678.12s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=689.68s)]
*  Stop talking about the famous people. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=690.16s)]
*  Houses that burned out. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=692.0s)]
*  Talk about the school. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=692.92s)]
*  What's that neighborhood. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=693.9599999999999s)]
*  Altadena they're talking about. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=694.76s)]
*  It's just talk about the poor people who are renting they no longer have a house and all their family heirlooms are done. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=696.56s)]
*  Yeah or they put all their money into this house. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=701.88s)]
*  They don't have a lot of money but you got a house in California that's going to appreciate. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=703.4799999999999s)]
*  Now that's gone. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=707.52s)]
*  Interns not paying out. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=708.0799999999999s)]
*  Also just the idea like if you don't have anything hearing someone's house that they own burned down didn't need your reaction is to not have empathy for that because you're like I don't even have a house to burn down. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=708.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=721.12s)]
*  You're immediately putting us in this position of have have not. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=721.92s)]
*  Nobody's talking about like all the landscapers and no longer have work because their entire neighborhood and area that they landscape is melted. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=724.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=731.08s)]
*  There's a lot of people who are fucked because of this. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=731.32s)]
*  I think the best portrayal of is just like what did you lose in the house. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=733.72s)]
*  People can relate to that. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=738.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=739.24s)]
*  You know I lost all the pictures of my daughter. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=739.6800000000001s)]
*  I lost all the pictures of my family. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=742.88s)]
*  I lost these family heirlooms. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=744.44s)]
*  Like I would be sad if I lost those things. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=746.36s)]
*  But when you talk about 40 million dollar Malibu house also don't even talk about the Malibu house. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=748.6800000000001s)]
*  Don't even bring that shit up. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=753.24s)]
*  Whether that exists or doesn't exist nobody want to hear about it. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=754.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=757.52s)]
*  Because nobody lives only in Malibu. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=757.92s)]
*  That's your second third fourth house is 50 million dollars. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=759.64s)]
*  Nobody gives a fuck right now. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=762.4399999999999s)]
*  Just point that shit at Altadena. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=764.64s)]
*  Point that shit at those families. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=767.1999999999999s)]
*  Where are they staying? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=768.52s)]
*  Are they in motels? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=769.52s)]
*  Do they have clothes? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=770.36s)]
*  Like what do the kids do? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=771.24s)]
*  The kids go to school. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=772.0s)]
*  That's the only way to get it. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=773.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=774.16s)]
*  You guys are so desensitized. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=774.92s)]
*  Like just in general. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=776.76s)]
*  Like you just see wars everywhere and then you see someone lost a house. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=777.64s)]
*  You're like well it's not as bad as. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=780.3199999999999s)]
*  The thing I saw two weeks ago. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=782.4s)]
*  It's crazy because you don't hear about the like it's death toll also. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=783.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=787.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=787.76s)]
*  When you hear 25 people died you're like first of all it's tragic. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=788.0s)]
*  Obviously 25 people died. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=791.1999999999999s)]
*  But. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=792.68s)]
*  That's like half a school shooting. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=794.56s)]
*  Yeah we're desensitized to 25. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=797.28s)]
*  Yeah like it's crazy. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=799.04s)]
*  Like. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=800.4s)]
*  So to us when you hear all this damage it's almost like. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=801.6s)]
*  If you resent the people who have. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=807.2s)]
*  And this like super wealthy class of people if you resent them it's almost like the perfect tragedy. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=811.32s)]
*  Because you're like wait a minute. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=817.4000000000001s)]
*  So all the billionaires houses got burned down. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=818.4000000000001s)]
*  And few people died. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=822.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=825.2s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=826.2s)]
*  Great. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=826.84s)]
*  This tapped into that resentment that I had and made me feel good. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=827.4000000000001s)]
*  Now you guys know the pain. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=830.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=831.5200000000001s)]
*  I feel like there's an overwhelming support for what's going on over there. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=832.5600000000001s)]
*  I think there's an undercurrent of this. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=838.32s)]
*  But I largely do feel a lot of that. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=839.8000000000001s)]
*  But I do think there's an undercurrent of people that are easily ridden off. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=841.48s)]
*  No there's some comment sections that are crazy. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=845.12s)]
*  Oh. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=846.6800000000001s)]
*  Palisades think about there's also people that have lived there an 80 year old is not going to take the time to rebuild and start over again versus. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=847.32s)]
*  Or is that first couple this is their first dream house their first. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=855.4s)]
*  Their kids schools burned down. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=859.28s)]
*  This is tragic. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=861.3199999999999s)]
*  There's so much like Palisades as well was like a real enclave of like locals like that was a dream neighborhood that was actually pretty well balanced. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=862.12s)]
*  Of course really rich homes but it's tragic. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=870.48s)]
*  I think LA is rallying behind it and there's a lot of support in LA. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=872.88s)]
*  But I think outside of LA and especially if you're a person who doesn't really have much and you're seeing like a celebrity post a GoFundMe for one of their friends. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=877.3199999999999s)]
*  The knee jerk reaction is like well why don't you fund it. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=888.28s)]
*  You know you're a celebrity you probably got hundreds of millions of dollars which they don't. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=892.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=896.0799999999999s)]
*  But you think they do. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=896.68s)]
*  So I and I think I looked at some of these comment sections also like making it about Gaza is just like bro the comments like this is Gaza every day is like nobody asked. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=898.12s)]
*  We're talking about California right now. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=909.88s)]
*  Talking about LA. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=912.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah but I don't like the left right stuff going on either. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=913.36s)]
*  Yeah you're saying like the politicization of the of the event. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=916.68s)]
*  That and also some people on a certain side are like oh you know what we're going to hold funding until they agree to a whole bunch of other stuff. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=921.3599999999999s)]
*  And I'm like you know when something this tragic happens like you just throw the money at it and let's just get everybody in a good place before you try to bring politics into this bullshit. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=928.88s)]
*  Yeah I mean I'm not against bringing politics in. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=939.3199999999999s)]
*  Why. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=941.88s)]
*  Because politicians make decisions that they have to be accountable for. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=943.1600000000001s)]
*  But I'm supportive of being critical of politicians on both sides. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=947.8000000000001s)]
*  So if these politicians are withholding funding simply to leverage the tragedy let's be critical of that. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=954.12s)]
*  If these politicians over here withheld funding to the fire department withheld funding to the things that clear the brush. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=961.72s)]
*  And withheld some or had some policy that affected the amount of water that could be in their reservoirs hold them accountable for that. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=969.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=978.3199999999999s)]
*  I think that political decisions have. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=978.56s)]
*  Influence this event. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=983.56s)]
*  So I think we got to hold those people accountable and please believe when politicians make decisions that benefit the city or the state or the country. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=985.48s)]
*  They love to take that credit. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=992.92s)]
*  This is my economy even Barack the best. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=995.0s)]
*  It was my economy that he inherited like. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=997.92s)]
*  I guess it's just no right time to talk about those things but it's just like when you're in the middle of the tragedy like let's just focus on helping the people. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1000.28s)]
*  I think. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1009.48s)]
*  Your anger needs an explanation. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1011.8s)]
*  How the fuck did this happen. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1013.52s)]
*  Now apparently like you guys said it's a lot of confluence of events that's crazy. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1015.0s)]
*  Hurricane level winds with the fire with the dry the drought blah blah blah. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1018.5200000000001s)]
*  But at some point you also got to look at how the fuck they can't be perfectly planned. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1022.6400000000001s)]
*  The city all the money was spent correctly etc etc. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1027.0800000000002s)]
*  And then everything happened. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1030.1200000000001s)]
*  And then we do feel like politicians don't really take accountability. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1031.68s)]
*  It doesn't feel like Gavin Newsom is saying you know what I take responsibility for what I've done. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1035.16s)]
*  Blah blah blah. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1038.64s)]
*  It seems like they're just like let me make sure I get reelected again let me make sure I look OK out of this. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1039.16s)]
*  And then you look at that and you get grossed out because you're angry looking at this. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1043.92s)]
*  You feel bad for those people. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1047.0s)]
*  There is a perfect out that there's a human being who fucks something up and isn't taking accountability. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1048.32s)]
*  Fuck that guy. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1052.68s)]
*  I also think that it's an outlet for their frustration that preceded this. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1053.32s)]
*  So it's like if you have frustration about homelessness if you have frustration about legislation if you have frustration about this city the crime rates in the city. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1056.72s)]
*  You had all this frustration about L.A. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1065.76s)]
*  But at the same time it's 75 every single day. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1068.32s)]
*  Got a job you still get paid you got a nice house. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1071.28s)]
*  All right. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1073.8799999999999s)]
*  Let me not cry about this right now. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1074.04s)]
*  Then this happens and it looks like there's an aptitude on behalf of the government and you're like you know what. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1076.6799999999998s)]
*  Fuck you. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1081.52s)]
*  You guys all got to get out of here. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1082.08s)]
*  So I think it's it's not the straw that broke the camel's back is a lot of fucking straw right here but it is indicative of a greater problem. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1083.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1091.1999999999998s)]
*  And I think it's a frustration with government in general. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1091.56s)]
*  And like progressive leadership. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1094.7199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1096.7199999999998s)]
*  People were mad at the mayor that she was in Ghana. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1097.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1099.76s)]
*  You see that. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1100.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1100.6799999999998s)]
*  Well I think she left before the fires. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1101.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1103.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1103.4799999999998s)]
*  But she was there already. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1104.28s)]
*  Which just what a fucking stressful. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1105.6799999999998s)]
*  I guess you knew it was going to be a fire. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1107.76s)]
*  I should have knew it was going to be windy that day. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1110.1999999999998s)]
*  What was crazy though is when they're interviewing her after she it's right after she gets off the plane but she just says nothing and then leaves. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1111.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1118.4399999999998s)]
*  The fucking the dead silence was crazy. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1119.1999999999998s)]
*  Your mayor. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1121.4399999999998s)]
*  Why are you going. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1122.1599999999999s)]
*  She's also promised not to do these international trips before. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1123.04s)]
*  Oh really. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1125.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1126.4799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1126.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1126.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1126.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1126.7199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1126.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1127.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1127.28s)]
*  That's a problem. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1127.4399999999998s)]
*  That makes more sense. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1128.1599999999999s)]
*  She can't take vacations. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1128.76s)]
*  No. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1129.6399999999999s)]
*  It's not a vacation. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1129.8799999999999s)]
*  She was at the inauguration of the new president of Ghana. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1130.6s)]
*  Like. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1132.9199999999998s)]
*  Why does she need to be in Ghana. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1133.28s)]
*  Because before she was on some committee that would send leaders out there like you're the mayor now. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1134.48s)]
*  You have one job. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1140.0400000000002s)]
*  All right guys. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1140.8400000000001s)]
*  Also we got some dates. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1141.8400000000001s)]

*  Bro, she's demanding to talk to the president of the United States. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1410.88s)]
*  That Mayor Karen is way better than this Mayor Karen. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1413.48s)]
*  Can y'all explain to me this smelt thing, the fish? [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1415.88s)]
*  No. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1419.5600000000002s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1419.92s)]

*  So people think it's controlled demolition. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1423.2s)]
*  Is that what you're talking about? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1427.2s)]

*  Don't even touch me. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1449.24s)]
*  The fact that it goes through that. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1450.3600000000001s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1453.0s)]
*  Smelt, smelt. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1453.52s)]
*  I can't smell. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1454.1200000000001s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1455.04s)]

*  I just thought it was similar types of clothing, but it's the same thing from yesterday. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1462.72s)]
*  It was white when I bought it. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1467.0s)]
*  Oh God. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1468.0s)]
*  So wait, what were we just saying? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1470.4s)]
*  Smelt. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1473.32s)]
*  The passage reservoir. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1473.96s)]
*  Explain this fish shit. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1475.0s)]
*  Like everybody's like, we could have, I think it was Trump on Rogan. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1476.24s)]
*  Who maybe started this conversation, but basically they could have taken water from, [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1480.2s)]
*  I don't know if it's Northern California or even Canada. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1485.28s)]
*  I think it's from up there to protect. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1487.28s)]
*  It's a threatened fish. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1489.64s)]
*  And instead of diverting it to reservoirs. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1490.76s)]
*  They diverted it to the ocean instead of bringing it to the reservoirs in an effort to protect the fish. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1493.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1501.6000000000001s)]
*  I heard it wouldn't have made a difference. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1501.88s)]
*  That's what I'm trying to get to. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1503.92s)]
*  It feels so easy. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1504.92s)]
*  The big thing was an empty. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1506.16s)]
*  But what kind of fish is it? [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1507.88s)]
*  Little. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1509.5600000000002s)]
*  It's a little tiny. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1509.96s)]
*  Nah. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1511.8400000000001s)]
*  It is. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1512.52s)]
*  But it's like, it just dictates the healthiness of your ocean. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1513.24s)]
*  If that particular fish is around. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1518.1200000000001s)]
*  It's one of the indicators that you have a healthy environment. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1520.88s)]
*  Shit. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1524.52s)]
*  Some bullshit. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1525.4s)]
*  Oh, the Delta smelt. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1526.0800000000002s)]
*  Trump is also, you know, he's having fun right now. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1527.72s)]
*  Trump is really having fun. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1531.6000000000001s)]
*  Talk to me. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1533.0s)]
*  He's just saying whatever the fuck he wants to say. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1533.48s)]
*  Even the shit last week, the Gulf of America. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1536.5200000000002s)]
*  I love it. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1539.4s)]
*  When we had that progressivism is dead conversation, it was based on me seeing him and Barack chopping it up at the funeral. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1541.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1547.96s)]
*  That was also very funny. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1548.68s)]
*  And I was like, oh, we're all done with all this progressive shit. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1549.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1553.3200000000002s)]
*  Trump is about to dominate. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1553.8000000000002s)]
*  Dems about to be popping. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1555.16s)]
*  No, I think the Dems are going to come back strong. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1556.5200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1558.1200000000001s)]
*  They just need somebody that's engaging. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1559.16s)]
*  And the problem is all these people that exist within the system right now are kind of indoctrinated by the Dem policy and the Dem rhetoric. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1561.0s)]
*  So I don't think it's going to be one of these people that we're seeing or that we've seen for the last like eight years at least. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1568.68s)]
*  I think it's got to be a new voice that pops up. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1575.24s)]
*  That's a rejection of that. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1577.3200000000002s)]

*  if you're allowed to park there during the day. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1963.4s)]

*  Where like, the rest of us, we got to read the sign. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1970.12s)]
*  I think that's the extent of the information that he has over us at this point right now. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1972.9199999999998s)]

*  Have you seen that AI app? [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1978.84s)]
*  You can just take a picture of a sign. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1979.7199999999998s)]
*  It tells you if you can park there. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1980.84s)]
*  That's how lazy we've gotten. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1982.28s)]
*  What? [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1984.1999999999998s)]
*  There's no way. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1986.28s)]
*  There's an app like, if people don't want to read a sign, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1987.3999999999999s)]
*  so they just take a picture of it and the app's like, no, you can't park there. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1989.8s)]
*  What do you mean don't want to? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1992.12s)]

*  But it's incredibly convoluted. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1994.84s)]
*  It's so confusing. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1996.1999999999998s)]
*  It'll say no parking Tuesday, Saturday, 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=1997.72s)]
*  and then right below it, no parking anytime. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2000.76s)]
*  And you'll be like, well, what the fuck does that mean? [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2002.52s)]
*  Why'd you even have the top sign? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2004.4399999999998s)]
*  That is a good point. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2005.72s)]
*  That is a good point. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2006.4399999999998s)]

*  I mean, that one's good. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2408.46s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2409.5800000000004s)]
*  The baby BBL is the- [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2410.54s)]
*  But that girl already got ass. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2411.82s)]
*  I think what they can do is they can take girls that have ass [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2413.02s)]
*  and move it around so it looks better. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2415.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2417.6600000000003s)]
*  What I don't think they can do is take the girls who have no ass [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2418.0600000000004s)]
*  and then add an ass on it without the hips. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2420.78s)]
*  It's like a shelf. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2423.02s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't look funny. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2423.5s)]
*  But why haven't they figured that out yet? [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2425.26s)]
*  Why is the ass so much more difficult than tits or jaw or nose [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2426.54s)]
*  or all these other things? [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2430.54s)]
*  I sometimes don't think it's the surgeon, bro. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2431.2599999999998s)]
*  I think it's girls going, [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2432.62s)]
*  give me the fattest thing possible. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2433.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2435.02s)]
*  Oh, so it's their decisions. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2435.2599999999998s)]
*  I think it's user error a little bit. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2436.86s)]
*  Really? [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2438.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2438.7799999999997s)]
*  Because when it first started, it was like, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2438.86s)]
*  the bigger the better. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2441.1s)]
*  Now it was starting to look a little ridiculous. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2442.46s)]
*  So now they're just perfecting this now. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2444.46s)]
*  All right. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2446.54s)]
*  And not enough people get it. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2446.94s)]
*  Call me crazy right now. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2448.22s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2449.74s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2450.38s)]
*  If you're a BBL surgeon, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2452.22s)]
*  do you go, like if you're a tattoo artist, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2454.62s)]
*  do you go, I refuse to do that because it reflects on me? [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2458.8599999999997s)]
*  This is what I think will work for you. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2463.42s)]
*  If you don't want this, then you have to go to somebody else [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2465.2599999999998s)]
*  to protect your brand. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2468.22s)]
*  Because if you see a botched BBL out there [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2470.54s)]
*  and someone's like, it's this doctor, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2472.2999999999997s)]
*  nobody's going back to that doctor. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2474.3799999999997s)]
*  That's true. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2476.7s)]
*  But I don't think they turned away any business. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2477.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2479.66s)]
*  The nature of that game is you get one thing, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2481.12s)]
*  you just keep coming back. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2483.2799999999997s)]
*  It is crazy to think like doctors are in the sales business. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2483.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2486.96s)]
*  Right? [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2487.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2488.3199999999997s)]
*  Like surgery, you don't need all that shit. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2489.12s)]
*  Explain that a little bit more to me. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2490.72s)]
*  Because I'm trying to think if there's something unethical about this. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2492.16s)]
*  It is. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2494.56s)]
*  I remember I broke my finger in college. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2495.04s)]
*  I know you're not going to make this about your finger. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2497.12s)]
*  Are you talking surgery? [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2499.6s)]
*  Only plastic surgery? [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2500.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2501.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2502.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2502.3199999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2502.64s)]
*  Wait, why? [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2502.8799999999997s)]
*  What'd they say? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2503.2799999999997s)]
*  How'd you break it? [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2504.08s)]
*  They said I... [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2504.8799999999997s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2507.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2507.6s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2508.56s)]
*  His own ass. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2509.28s)]
*  Son, it's way more complicated than the death you need. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2512.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2515.52s)]
*  Bring it down, bring it down. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2515.76s)]
*  So, oh, you were saying he was up charging you for a surgery? [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2516.7200000000003s)]
*  No, then I... [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2519.36s)]
*  So I broke... [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2519.84s)]
*  They put a little... [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2520.32s)]
*  The cast on or whatever. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2520.8s)]
*  Then they send me to a plastic surgeon. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2521.6800000000003s)]
*  And the plastic surgeon's like, [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2524.0800000000004s)]
*  yeah, you need surgery. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2525.1200000000003s)]
*  It's going to be $4,000. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2525.76s)]
*  And I'm like, all right, I guess. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2527.36s)]
*  And then my mom was like, no, fuck that. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2528.7200000000003s)]
*  We go get a second opinion from my uncle's friend [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2530.2400000000002s)]
*  who's like a hand bone specialist. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2532.6400000000003s)]
*  And he's like, surgery is not going to fix anything. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2534.6400000000003s)]
*  You're still going to... [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2536.5600000000004s)]
*  It's still going to look fucked up afterward. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2537.52s)]
*  You're just going to go through pain and money [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2538.96s)]
*  you don't need to go through. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2540.48s)]
*  Just leave a sling on it and that's it. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2541.6s)]
*  Or like leave the cast on and that's it. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2542.96s)]
*  How is that not considered medical malpractice? [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2544.2400000000002s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2545.84s)]
*  They tried to tell my mom that she had to get her thyroid taken out. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2546.8s)]
*  That's fucking crazy. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2550.48s)]
*  And they're like, yeah, you probably won't be able to have kids after that. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2551.6s)]
*  And she was like, what? [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2553.44s)]
*  They tried to tell my mom she needed a hysterectomy when she was like 35. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2554.4s)]
*  What's a hysterectomy? [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2558.08s)]
*  This removed the whole ovaries. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2559.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2560.32s)]
*  Trains? [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2560.88s)]
*  The whole uterus. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2561.28s)]
*  The uterus. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2562.0s)]
*  It's not trains. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2562.96s)]
*  They want to make it where I'm trained? [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2563.6s)]
*  Is that why it's a hysterectomy? [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2565.68s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2568.0s)]
*  What? [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2568.56s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2568.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2570.24s)]
*  The whole uterus. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2570.8s)]
*  Take out the whole uterus. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2571.52s)]
*  What'd you do in there? [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2572.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2574.48s)]
*  I must have fucked it up to be honest. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2574.96s)]
*  I did damage. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2577.68s)]
*  Or my dad did. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2578.4s)]
*  Bad ass kid. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2579.04s)]
*  No, for real. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2582.16s)]
*  And then she said no? [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2583.36s)]
*  No, she was just like, I'm not. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2584.24s)]
*  No, I'm not doing that. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2585.52s)]
*  That seems way too extreme. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2586.72s)]
*  And then she ended up being fine. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2587.92s)]
*  Wow. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2589.2s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2589.84s)]
*  I feel like that should be medical malpractice. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2590.24s)]
*  It absolutely should be. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2591.7599999999998s)]
*  And they're doing it just because they could charge the insurance company [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2592.64s)]
*  or whatever they get paid off of it. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2594.96s)]
*  They get paid crazy money and that's it. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2596.3999999999996s)]
*  Wow. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2598.16s)]
*  And then you're just taking out a woman's uterus. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2598.7999999999997s)]
*  And there's got to be some doctors that have done like 20 or 30 of these cases [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2600.64s)]
*  and the women are probably complaining about it. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2603.92s)]
*  Our dudes are complaining about it now and nobody's talking about it. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2605.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2608.0s)]
*  That's some scumbag shit right there. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2608.64s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2610.0s)]
*  I mean, that's the whole back surgery thing with Mangione. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2611.52s)]
*  What happened with him? [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2613.92s)]
*  It was like apparently there's like a back surgery racket that's going on. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2614.64s)]
*  The saying is like the first back surgery is unnecessary, [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2618.8799999999997s)]
*  but the second one is necessary. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2621.44s)]
*  And why is that? [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2622.7999999999997s)]
*  It's fixed what the first one did. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2623.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2624.24s)]
*  And that like they're overprescribing medical intervention on backs. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2624.88s)]
*  So now you're in this back surgery loop where you just constantly... [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2628.08s)]
*  I heard that about hip too. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2631.52s)]
*  Makes sense. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2633.2000000000003s)]
*  Like I think they've found some version of correcting this, [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2633.92s)]
*  but essentially like you want to push off hip surgery as far as you can [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2639.44s)]
*  because it needs to be resurfaced, I think it's called, like every 10 years. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2643.84s)]
*  So they were just chopping off your hip and then putting like a fake one in place now. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2648.32s)]
*  And I think that they have like a better version of it. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2651.92s)]
*  But yeah, what is the balance of that? [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2654.0s)]
*  Like if you're dentistry, they always crush into a pull a tooth. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2656.24s)]
*  They're rushing to put in braces. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2660.32s)]
*  First time I went to the dentist in LA, they said I had 10 fillings and I was like, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2662.08s)]
*  I'm freaking out again. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2665.2s)]
*  My mom was like, go get a second opinion. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2666.0s)]
*  Guy goes, you guys have two cavities we need to fill. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2668.0s)]
*  You got to start in your family. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2671.92s)]
*  I feel like you know so many doctors. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2673.12s)]
*  Why are you going... [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2674.64s)]
*  Stop going outsource. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2675.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2676.96s)]
*  I fucked that up. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2677.92s)]
*  Keep it in networks. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2678.48s)]
*  This is all when I was in college or right out of college. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2679.2s)]
*  Ever since then, I don't... [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2681.68s)]
*  Only Brown doctors. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2683.2s)]
*  I don't trust anybody else and I got to know you. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2684.24s)]
*  You trust the Brown doctors. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2685.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2687.2799999999997s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2687.8399999999997s)]
*  Shouts Omar. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2688.24s)]
*  Omar is great. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2689.04s)]
*  Yeah, shouts Omar. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2689.68s)]
*  Shouts. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2690.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2691.04s)]
*  But that's it. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2691.52s)]
*  Keep it in the family. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2692.3199999999997s)]
*  See, this is what happens. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2693.44s)]
*  My doctor's brown. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2694.24s)]
*  And oh, well, yeah, I guess we're both sick so we can do that. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2696.16s)]
*  He knows you. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2699.6s)]
*  He was like, do you work with Akashi? [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2700.48s)]
*  How do you say it? [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2703.44s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I tried to do it. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2704.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh, actually, cool, cool announcements in the world of the greatest sport that's ever existed. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2707.04s)]
*  The only people that would disagree with it are the people that have not played it yet, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2712.96s)]
*  and that is paddle. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2716.08s)]
*  The Reserve Cup down in Miami. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2717.84s)]
*  Reserve is this amazing paddle facility, but it's also a company that's really [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2721.12s)]
*  being like the ambassadors of paddle. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2727.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2728.88s)]
*  And they put on this thing called the Reserve Cup in Miami. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2729.52s)]
*  And I'm going to go down next week, like Wednesday through Saturday. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2733.52s)]
*  So I'm going to go down there. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2738.24s)]
*  I'm going to get to be a captain of one of the teams. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2739.52s)]
*  Me and Derek Jeter. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2742.48s)]
*  That's so fucking sick. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2743.44s)]
*  That's so fucking far. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2744.64s)]
*  And I got to tell Derek, I got to say, listen, winner gets a gift basket. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2746.64s)]
*  I think that's a very fair thing to pitch to him. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2753.28s)]
*  I'm also trying to find a way to pitch that to him without that being our first interaction. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2757.52s)]
*  He's a happily married man. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2763.92s)]
*  He's got a beautiful family, but I want a gift basket. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2765.12s)]
*  Anyway, so yeah, so that's going to be happening out there. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2768.48s)]
*  If you want to see paddle at the highest level, if you're someone who listens to the pod, [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2771.92s)]
*  you like paddle, I think what's cool about this setup is they have these teams that the players [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2776.16s)]
*  usually play with each other. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2780.64s)]
*  Obviously, it's a two on two sport, but with this, we can choose the teams through a lottery. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2781.76s)]
*  So we can, the teams could be different and could be teams that have never been played before. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2786.4s)]
*  So it could be you and a pro player? [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2790.8s)]
*  Well, there's going to do like pro-am. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2792.32s)]
*  There's going to be a charity. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2793.68s)]
*  We're going to raise some money. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2794.48s)]
*  And we should give the money to the fire. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2795.76s)]
*  Oh, that'd be sick. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2800.88s)]
*  That would be the right thing to do. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2801.76s)]
*  I suggested a different charity because that was before LA was on fire. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2803.76s)]
*  A charity. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2807.92s)]
*  But it was still a charity. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2808.96s)]
*  But yeah, we should actually do this for fire. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2809.92s)]
*  Can I ask you what charity and then we decide which one's more worthy of the money? [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2811.44s)]
*  I was going to say IVF, like fertility stuff. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2814.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2816.7200000000003s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2817.2000000000003s)]
*  But too bad for you guys, LA's burning. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2817.92s)]
*  We're going to rebuild some billionaire's homes and that'll do. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2823.04s)]
*  So anyway, but yeah, so that's going to be next week. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2825.36s)]
*  Wednesday, we're going to do the draft and then Thursday, Friday, Saturday, they got the thing. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2832.1600000000003s)]
*  So go down there. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2835.6800000000003s)]
*  And we need steak to be able to gamble on paddle. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2836.7200000000003s)]
*  That's right. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2841.2000000000003s)]
*  There's all these guys that got money to do these side matches where they're putting real money on games. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2841.92s)]
*  My thing is I don't gamble on anything that I actually enjoy doing [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2847.52s)]
*  because it will make it too enjoyable. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2850.96s)]
*  Do you know how fantasy football makes you so excited about teams you don't even fucking care about? [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2853.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2858.7200000000003s)]
*  So I'm just like, I got to stay away. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2859.2000000000003s)]
*  Imagine you win a paddle game and like 10 grand. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2860.48s)]
*  I don't want to even think about that. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2862.4s)]
*  I'll quit everything. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2864.0800000000004s)]
*  I'll tell my wife, I think I figured it out. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2865.1200000000003s)]
*  What am I going to do in the next four years of my life? [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2867.1200000000003s)]
*  Anyway, so the Reserve Cup down there, you can go get tickets. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2870.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm sure they'll put some kind of link, but go check it out. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2873.04s)]
*  It's a really awesome setup and they got it catered and it's beautiful. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2875.2000000000003s)]
*  It's right there on the water. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2878.7200000000003s)]
*  Go check it. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2879.76s)]
*  I think you guys really like it. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2880.88s)]
*  They are great ambassadors for paddle. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2882.16s)]
*  The guys who are involved really love the sport. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2884.4s)]
*  There's no money in the sport right now. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2886.88s)]
*  It's literally people who are obsessed with it [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2888.32s)]
*  and they're putting their own money up to make these things successful. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2890.0s)]
*  Go check it out. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2893.2s)]
*  I think it's going to be like the premier experience and I'll be there talking shit. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2893.92s)]
*  As a matter of fact, if you want to get a game and get that ass kicked, [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2898.0s)]
*  I'll play you with a pro of my selection. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2901.44s)]
*  I'll play any two people out there in Miami as long as I have a pro of my selection on my team. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2903.92s)]
*  That's very fair. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2909.2s)]
*  I feel like that's fair. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2910.08s)]
*  Very fair. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2910.8s)]
*  I'm not even putting money on it. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2911.28s)]
*  Anyway, okay, so outside in sports that are not as interesting and not as obsessive. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2914.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, there are some pretty. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2918.88s)]
*  Much more niche sports. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2919.84s)]
*  Yeah, let's talk about the niche sports out there. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2920.8s)]
*  Yeah, what's that? [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2922.5600000000004s)]
*  The playoffs are happening right now. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2923.6000000000004s)]
*  Oh, there's a place. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2924.5600000000004s)]
*  Okay, got it. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2925.44s)]
*  So tell us what's going on here. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2926.7200000000003s)]
*  We have some interesting scenarios. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2929.2000000000003s)]
*  Is Akash been in Oracle? [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2930.48s)]
*  No, actually I was wrong about the Texans. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2932.48s)]
*  I thought they kind of limped into the playoffs, but they beat the fuck out of it. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2935.36s)]
*  Who do they play? [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2939.28s)]
*  I forget who they play. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2939.84s)]
*  Chargers. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2940.4s)]
*  The Chargers, they beat the shit out of them. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2940.8s)]
*  And then the LA Rams play the Minnesota Vikings, who everybody thought was like the second best team [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2942.96s)]
*  in the conference. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2948.32s)]
*  Didn't you say Vikings could make it all the way? [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2949.04s)]
*  That's what everybody had convinced me. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2950.8s)]
*  And I hadn't watched this fucking guy. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2952.1600000000003s)]
*  Their fault. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2955.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2955.76s)]
*  It's not your fault. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2956.8s)]
*  It's their fault, man. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2957.52s)]
*  So I watched this guy, Sam Darnold. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2958.6400000000003s)]
*  I watched him one game early in the season. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2960.32s)]
*  He's like a, he was drafted very highly and then really struggled in the pros. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2962.0s)]
*  And then the Vikings are winning with him as quarterback. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2965.92s)]
*  It's kind of like a one year option. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2968.32s)]
*  But they keep winning. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2970.3999999999996s)]
*  And then I watched one game against the Colton. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2971.3599999999997s)]
*  He doesn't look that good, but they win. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2973.12s)]
*  So I'm like, whatever. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2974.64s)]
*  I was middle of the year. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2975.52s)]
*  And then I keep hearing about him and they keep winning. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2976.64s)]
*  So I'm like, maybe I just happened to watch a bad game. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2978.56s)]
*  Maybe they're really fucking good. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2981.04s)]
*  People are picking them to go to the Super Bowl. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2982.24s)]
*  I haven't been watching enough. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2983.52s)]
*  I see him against Detroit, gets his ass beat. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2985.52s)]
*  And then I see him this week, get his ass beat again. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2988.3999999999996s)]
*  And I'm like, well, this guy was exactly who the fuck we all thought he was. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2990.96s)]
*  You convinced us of something else. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2994.96s)]
*  He's not that. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2996.3999999999996s)]
*  Also, I think LA is playing for something now. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=2997.36s)]
*  They played LA and LA just throttled them. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3000.32s)]
*  So LA is playing the Eagles and I am an Eagles hater. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3003.2000000000003s)]
*  I would love for LA to win. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3006.4s)]
*  I don't know how long they can sustain this emotional thing. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3007.6s)]
*  But I do think it's possible they have a fucking cause [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3011.52s)]
*  that is unlike any other cause out there right now. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3015.44s)]
*  So I think LA is a dark horse that is pretty scary in that sense. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3018.2400000000002s)]
*  Okay. So you choose LA or LA. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3022.0s)]
*  I would put LA to cover. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3023.76s)]
*  I don't know what the spread is going to be. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3025.04s)]
*  I imagine it's going to be fairly high. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3026.08s)]
*  I put LA. I hope Detroit wins. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3028.0s)]
*  They should win. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3030.24s)]
*  They're the seemingly best team in the league probably. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3031.2s)]
*  And then the AFC, the best game is going to be the Ravens and the Bills. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3033.6s)]
*  That's going to be the best game of the whole playoffs, I think. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3039.2799999999997s)]
*  Because these are two really good teams. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3041.84s)]
*  Both quarterbacks are really fucking good. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3043.6s)]
*  They just can't beat Patrick Mahomes. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3045.2s)]
*  And now they have this kind of reputation of being like playoff underachievers. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3046.88s)]
*  But in reality, they're just going up against Jordan. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3050.08s)]
*  But then them two going head to head to see who could theoretically play Mahomes. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3052.64s)]
*  That's going to be a fun game. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3056.0s)]
*  It's going to be such a fucking good game. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3057.12s)]
*  So what do you got? [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3058.32s)]
*  So great games all around. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3058.8s)]
*  I think I'm going to go with the Bills. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3059.92s)]
*  I actually think the Bills, I think this is their year, I think. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3061.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3064.0s)]
*  To go to the Super Bowl. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3064.4s)]
*  And then I think the Chiefs will win. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3065.28s)]
*  The Texans look better than I thought, but I think the Chiefs will win. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3067.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3069.6s)]
*  So those are my picks. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3070.16s)]
*  Also the Cowboys coach basically just left. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3071.6s)]
*  He just peaced out. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3074.8s)]
*  Oh, I thought he was fired. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3075.44s)]
*  So his contract, so Jerry doesn't like paying any, like he wouldn't fire the coach last year. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3076.64s)]
*  He was saying that. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3080.96s)]
*  Yeah, I believe that. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3081.84s)]
*  Yeah, I believe Jerry. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3082.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3083.36s)]
*  So he just, his coach that should have been fired last year had a year left on the contract. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3084.08s)]
*  He's like, well, instead of firing him and paying him and hiring another coach, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3088.0s)]
*  I'll just let his contract run out and waste everybody's life for a year. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3090.2400000000002s)]
*  And now his contract is up and they were trying to renegotiate. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3093.36s)]
*  And the coach, from what I'm hearing, the coach was like, I'm good. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3096.4s)]
*  This is Chip Kelly. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3099.52s)]
*  This is Mike McCarthy. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3100.56s)]
*  Sorry, Mike McCarthy. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3101.92s)]
*  Why am I thinking of Chip Kelly? [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3102.88s)]
*  So now the, I don't know, he's the offensive coordinator of the, [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3104.08s)]
*  some college team that's good, Ohio State. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3108.1600000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3110.08s)]
*  But now the question is who are the Cowboys going to get to be their coach? [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3110.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3114.56s)]
*  There's one option that excites me. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3116.08s)]
*  Dion. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3119.12s)]
*  Dion. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3119.52s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3120.24s)]
*  Dion, I'd be so fucking excited. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3122.08s)]
*  I thought there was interest in the Raiders job because I think they just fired Antonio Pierce. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3122.96s)]
*  So yeah, apparently Tom Brady's trying to get, who actually probably will be the best coach [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3127.44s)]
*  is Ben Johnson from the Lions. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3130.7999999999997s)]
*  He's their offensive coordinator. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3132.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3133.2s)]
*  Apparently Tom Brady's trying to get him. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3133.52s)]
*  You know, it's funny, you get an owner, who cares? [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3135.36s)]
*  And knows how to win. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3138.0s)]
*  Things can change, but Ben Johnson's going to want 15 to 17 million a year. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3139.44s)]
*  I don't think Jerry's going to pay that. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3143.36s)]
*  Dion might not cost that much, but he has an $8 million buyout at Colorado. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3144.88s)]
*  I don't know if the Cowboys owner is going to want to pay $8 million. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3149.6s)]
*  In order for him to leave Colorado. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3152.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3153.68s)]
*  So I don't know if that happens, but if that happened, I'd be excited. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3154.16s)]
*  It'd be so fun. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3156.56s)]
*  It'd be the most fun. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3157.28s)]
*  You know, it's so, what's so crazy with sports, like the amount of money the players are making now, [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3158.16s)]
*  $8 million is an absurd amount of money. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3163.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3167.36s)]
*  But when you said it, my knee-jerk reaction was like, [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3167.84s)]
*  oh, well, I wouldn't the Cowboys just buy out $8 million? [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3170.32s)]
*  Well, also the Cowboys are worth the most valuable franchise in the fucking planet. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3172.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3176.32s)]
*  12 billion or whatever. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3176.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3177.6800000000003s)]
*  So what's $8 million? [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3177.76s)]
*  But he just don't spend, he's like Donald Sterling now. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3178.7200000000003s)]
*  He just don't spend money. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3180.88s)]
*  Got it. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3181.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3182.2400000000002s)]
*  Unless it's, you know, the place in St. Bards said he wants to stay. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3182.56s)]

*  You just got to keep it interesting. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3552.56s)]
*  Eventually you get through all your trauma and you're like, well, I don't want to let them down. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3554.0s)]
*  They eat this every week. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3558.16s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3559.52s)]

*  I continue to listen to you and make money. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3563.6s)]
*  You think they do that? [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3567.2799999999997s)]
*  You think therapists do that at all? [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3568.08s)]
*  Do you think they're like trying to like, I can't fix them too quick. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3569.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3572.16s)]
*  Stretch this out a little bit. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3573.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, maybe those therapy sessions are mad short. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3574.56s)]
*  I remember I went to one and they're like, all right, it's an hour long sesh. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3576.3199999999997s)]
*  And they go, well, technically it's 50 minutes. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3579.3599999999997s)]
*  And then the first eight minutes is, how are you doing? [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3581.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3584.48s)]
*  And the last five minutes is debrief. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3584.7999999999997s)]
*  So you got 30 minutes to unpack your entire life trauma. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3586.64s)]
*  Isn't it funny when the time is about to run out and they got to like politely. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3589.36s)]
*  Start talking about some heavy shit. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3594.0s)]
*  The two end of this, like you see them kind of clocking and be like, oh, so that must have been devastating. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3595.44s)]
*  So I don't know if we have enough time to figure this out. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3600.2400000000002s)]
*  And you're like, I'm getting molested right now. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3603.1200000000003s)]
*  I don't have another week to deal with this. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3606.0800000000004s)]
*  They're magnificent at buttoning it up. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3609.1200000000003s)]
*  We should talk to a therapist about that. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3612.4s)]
*  What is the gnarliest thing that you've had to button up because there wasn't enough time? [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3614.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3620.88s)]
*  Well, I think people also kind of do that on purpose. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3621.68s)]
*  They see the clocks running out and they're like, all right, let me just dump some shit and then keep it moving. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3623.44s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3626.72s)]
*  And so they just get it all out and they're like, yeah, I talked about it. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3627.2s)]
*  But then they don't actually work on it and then they can keep it pushing. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3629.6s)]
*  Sounds like that's what you do. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3631.7599999999998s)]
*  Of course. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3633.2s)]
*  You got to just dump right at the end. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3633.68s)]
*  You think therapists don't just remember the next week? [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3636.0s)]
*  They told me you got fucked in the ass by the end of the session. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3638.24s)]
*  How could they remember? [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3640.3199999999997s)]
*  That's the thing. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3641.44s)]
*  How could they remember? [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3642.4s)]
*  Yeah, but like, it don't ever look like they got it Dewey decimaled. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3643.84s)]
*  They got 15 different people who are retarded that they're talking to every single. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3649.44s)]
*  There's no way that those stories don't kind of cross. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3653.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that could happen. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3656.0s)]
*  Have you ever had your therapist think that your story was someone else's? [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3656.88s)]
*  No, that would be crazy. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3660.64s)]
*  Bring it up. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3662.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3662.48s)]
*  And then just go with it for two months. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3663.92s)]
*  You never did that? [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3665.6800000000003s)]
*  So you tried to kill yourself? [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3667.76s)]
*  You're like, maybe. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3668.7200000000003s)]

*  But yeah, I also don't believe that. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3714.72s)]

*  I just had a question, okay? [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3881.12s)]
*  I'm here with some of my friends, right? [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3882.4s)]

*  Abram says hi. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3888.0s)]
*  You don't have to talk about this if you wouldn't like to. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3888.88s)]
*  If you feel uncomfortable, you don't have to say a singular thing. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3890.4s)]
*  But Mark keeps talking about the coffee enemas. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3892.7200000000003s)]
*  And we need to know what the benefits of those are. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3895.28s)]
*  These guys don't believe in the benefits of coffee enemas. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3896.96s)]
*  And I said, oh, no, I think there are a lot of benefits. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3898.96s)]
*  And I wanted to ask you, are there any benefits to coffee enemas [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3901.04s)]
*  if you're willing to talk about it? [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3903.2s)]
*  It increases glutathione, detoxes your liver. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3905.12s)]
*  Detoxes your liver, increases glutathione. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3909.52s)]
*  Good things. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3911.44s)]
*  Yeah, glutathione being a master antioxidant [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3912.0s)]
*  was used, I think, originally during World War II or after World War II. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3914.88s)]
*  Yeah, I think before World War II for coffee for pain management. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3920.16s)]
*  So people have been doing this for 60, 70 years, maybe even longer. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3923.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's not new. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3926.4s)]
*  Not new at all. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3927.52s)]
*  OK, so now, Mrs. Gagnon, it's Schultz. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3928.24s)]
*  How do you create the time to do it without everybody knowing that that's what's happening? [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3932.64s)]
*  Why do you have to hide it? [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3939.04s)]
*  That's what I'm talking about. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3941.04s)]
*  We knew you wouldn't be embarrassed about that. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3943.04s)]
*  I thought you'd be embarrassed to talk about it, Mom. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3944.64s)]
*  But do you go to the bathroom? [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3948.56s)]
*  Is it something you can do publicly? [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3950.08s)]
*  How is it done? [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3952.56s)]
*  You definitely don't do it publicly. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3953.52s)]
*  You do it in the privacy of your own bathroom. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3955.52s)]
*  If you were going to take a shower, you know? [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3958.24s)]
*  OK, we once walked into the bathroom here and Mark had his legs in the air and we're like, [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3960.56s)]

*  And there was no enema. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3967.68s)]
*  We were just like, why are you lying? [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3968.72s)]
*  This is not a true story. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3970.3199999999997s)]
*  I would never do that. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3971.68s)]
*  You lie. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3972.9599999999996s)]
*  You do lie. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=3973.68s)]

*  She's very confident in herself. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4001.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4003.28s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4008.64s)]

*  So she's... [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4014.16s)]
*  Why is there anything to be ashamed of? [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4015.44s)]
*  There's nothing to be ashamed of. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4016.72s)]

*  Yes. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4038.64s)]
*  I think we should all do it. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4038.9599999999996s)]
*  Like a hookah, we get eight of them lined up. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4040.08s)]
*  We just fucking let it rip, dude. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4042.7999999999997s)]

*  We might need a hookah for the pod. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4048.96s)]
*  That could be a nice little vibe. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4050.56s)]
*  That would be fire. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4051.6s)]

*  What's the shit with hookahs? [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4072.24s)]
*  They say you're not inhaling, but you're inhaling. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4074.8s)]
*  No, you're not inhaling. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4077.44s)]

*  I mean, do you inhale gum? [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4082.64s)]
*  What? [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4085.92s)]
*  You just put it in your mouth. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4086.32s)]
*  No, it goes down and then it goes back up. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4088.08s)]

*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4236.8s)]
*  I was reluctantly having sex with this model. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4237.679999999999s)]

*  You don't get uncomfortable lying. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4245.28s)]
*  You say a lie and you feel like, and then it just ruminates in your head forever. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4246.32s)]
*  And then you're like, I should call my friends in high school and be like, hey, man, that actually wasn't true. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4250.639999999999s)]

*  This is what I think. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4260.96s)]
*  This is the discomfort with the lie. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4262.24s)]
*  There's obviously the moral shit that starts chipping away at you a little bit. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4264.799999999999s)]

*  I'm doing something that's wrong. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4270.48s)]
*  The other thing is the anxiety and exhaustion of keeping the lie going, I think is worse than just admitting, actually, I did do that. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4272.24s)]
*  Like that keeping the lie going is... [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4284.48s)]
*  Look at how unrelatable this is to Al right now. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4287.36s)]

*  It is crumpled up because I've already devoured it. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4380.32s)]
*  These are the David protein bars. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4382.96s)]
*  But before you say anything, just let me just state right now. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4385.36s)]
*  OK? [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4388.96s)]
*  This will be the biggest protein bar on the planet. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4390.24s)]
*  It will be the protein bar that everybody just consumes because it's very simple. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4393.52s)]
*  Not only does it taste delicious, it's going to give you more protein than any other bar. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4397.68s)]
*  That's why we're eating it. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4401.36s)]
*  We're not eating the protein bar because we're like, you know what? [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4402.32s)]
*  I don't want to go out to dinner with my boys. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4405.28s)]
*  I'd rather just have a protein bar. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4406.96s)]
*  No, no, we want the fucking protein. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4408.24s)]
*  OK? [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4410.24s)]
*  Most protein with the least calories. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4410.56s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4412.16s)]
*  That's the other thing. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4412.96s)]
*  You have some of these other protein bars, but it's really all calories. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4413.52s)]
*  So you're just eating a cookie. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4415.92s)]
*  Give me the fucking cookie if that's the case. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4417.12s)]
*  The protein bar. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4419.04s)]
*  This is again, I've already devoured it. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4420.08s)]

*  Here's a better idea. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4564.080000000001s)]
*  American financing. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4565.84s)]
*  American financing can help. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4567.6s)]
*  They give you loans using your home's equity. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4569.6s)]
*  It's a family owned company that's been around for a quarter century. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4572.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4574.96s)]
*  Their mortgage consultants are also salary based. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4575.200000000001s)]
*  So there's no financial incentive to put you into a shitty loan [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4577.84s)]
*  just so they can make a commission. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4581.040000000001s)]
*  That's very important. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4582.320000000001s)]
*  I think it's worth saying again. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4583.6s)]
*  Their loan people are salary based. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4585.04s)]
*  They're not trying to just throw you into loans [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4588.16s)]
*  so they can add a pool to their house. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4590.0s)]
*  They're salary based. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4592.08s)]
*  Okay. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4593.68s)]
*  They're not going to put you in a shitty loan just so they can make some money. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4594.16s)]
*  Customers save $800 a month on average [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4596.88s)]
*  and you won't be charged for any upfront or hidden fees. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4599.2s)]
*  Okay. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4601.6s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4616.96s)]
*  But you have that. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4618.88s)]
*  This is where I think like a religious background is very helpful [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4620.08s)]
*  because it's like this nudge in an ethical or moral direction. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4623.36s)]
*  So like I can see the concern you have about lying. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4627.6s)]
*  Now he'll go as close to lying as you possibly can. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4631.2s)]

*  and he'll get the thing that he needs. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4638.08s)]
*  But he doesn't lie to get it. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4640.16s)]
*  He won't straight up say something that's not true. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4642.32s)]
*  Is that a fair act of a statement? [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4645.2s)]
*  Like you won't be like, oh this horrible disaster happened. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4646.88s)]

*  You're right. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4652.56s)]

*  Like I've one time, this was like a year ago, [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4661.28s)]

*  This is where, this is where it gets into the discussion of maintaining the omission. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4690.240000000001s)]
*  It's almost as bad as maintaining the lie. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4695.6s)]
*  So like my wife goes, oh, what'd you guys do last night? [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4698.0s)]
*  I forget where we were. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4700.320000000001s)]
*  We went to some strip club or something like that. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4701.120000000001s)]
*  We were in Hawaii, right? [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4703.28s)]
*  And I was like, we went to some strip club. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4704.4s)]
*  I could say, oh, we went to dinner and then we party at this thing and then we went home. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4707.759999999999s)]
*  But it's like, we didn't exactly do that. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4711.759999999999s)]
*  So if I dragged it and then she goes, oh, well, what happened after? [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4714.639999999999s)]
*  Oh, but this funny story. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4718.32s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4720.5599999999995s)]
*  And it's just like, if I just say we did this thing, which I didn't do anything bad at the [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4721.04s)]
*  strip club, then it's perfect. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4724.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4726.8s)]
*  How was Hawaii's strip clubs? [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4727.2s)]
*  Bro, we, we, we, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4728.719999999999s)]
*  they weren't Hawaiian. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4731.6s)]
*  It's just a bunch of Samoan girls like testing the integrity of the pole. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4733.52s)]
*  No, no, no, but we did some shit at this like, it's not even strip club. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4739.76s)]
*  It's like, what is it called? [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4743.360000000001s)]
*  They're like, we're so gay. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4744.8s)]
*  This is, this is, this is all sounding like a brothel. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4747.76s)]
*  So you have that. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4750.400000000001s)]
*  I was like, blow your mind. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4750.88s)]
*  There's, you know how like in Asian cultures, they don't really know how to like talk to [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4752.8s)]
*  women. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4755.84s)]
*  So what they do is they commodify it, right? [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4756.160000000001s)]
*  And they're like, there's like a, there's like a Korean experience where you go to a [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4758.16s)]
*  place and then they just have girls there to talk to you. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4764.0s)]
*  And it's called a host club or something like that. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4768.0s)]
*  And it's basically a bunch of like Asian businessmen go there and they talk and they [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4771.6s)]
*  kind of do their deals, but there's like girls around, right? [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4774.8s)]
*  And so this guy who was like taking us around, he's like, do you guys want to like see this [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4778.08s)]
*  like Korean cultural experience? [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4783.2s)]
*  And we're like, yeah, all right. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4785.2s)]
*  Sounds like really weird. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4787.759999999999s)]
*  So we're in this room and it's just awkward because we're not Koreans doing business. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4788.879999999999s)]
*  We're just sitting around. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4795.44s)]
*  There's a pole in the middle of the thing, but we're kind of talking. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4796.24s)]
*  And then we just go, yo, put on the Hamilton soundtrack. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4798.96s)]
*  We want these girls dancing to [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4806.0s)]
*  and at first they didn't know how to dance to it. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4811.2s)]
*  So then we started singing and dancing Disney, Disney songs mixed with Hamilton, bro. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4815.12s)]
*  At one point, five of us were standing up on the pole singing. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4825.2s)]
*  The girls were sitting down drinking. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4827.44s)]
*  It was like 30 minutes of it. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4838.32s)]
*  And they were just sitting there like, what do we leave? [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4839.84s)]
*  Like, are we getting paid? [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4842.16s)]
*  Like what is happening? [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4842.96s)]
*  They had no clue what was going on to the point. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4843.84s)]
*  They just started taking their clothes off. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4846.8s)]
*  We're like, no, no, we're good. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4848.0s)]
*  Just keep your clothes on. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4848.88s)]
*  We're going to dance these songs. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4849.68s)]
*  Do you know the words? [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4850.8s)]
*  We put on Frozen. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4852.16s)]
*  One of these little 12 year olds was like, oh, I got this one. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4853.04s)]
*  They were not 12. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4857.04s)]
*  These are today's men, bro. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4859.4400000000005s)]
*  We're respectful. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4862.72s)]
*  This is what the red pills could play. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4863.4400000000005s)]
*  And then I was DJing and we got the vibe back. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4870.16s)]
*  I was playing just regular rap music and the vibe was sick. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4872.48s)]
*  And then 10 minutes in, I just went right back to Hamilton. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4875.84s)]
*  And one of the girls just left. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4878.639999999999s)]
*  I remember the first time she was on Walker Strupler. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4881.76s)]
*  Bro, she's on the pole trying to dance all day. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4887.36s)]
*  And then you just hear, I can show you. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4889.44s)]
*  She just left. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4893.84s)]
*  You hit that, by the way. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4894.32s)]
*  Thank you, dude. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4895.2s)]
*  Thank you, dude. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4895.679999999999s)]
*  Bro, that was fun. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4896.719999999999s)]
*  But isn't it so much better to tell the truth and then it's fine? [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4898.16s)]
*  And if you don't want to tell the truth, [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4901.360000000001s)]
*  then maybe what you're doing, you shouldn't do. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4902.4800000000005s)]
*  So you just stay in front of it and everything works out. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4904.56s)]
*  OK, what about the example I gave? [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4907.92s)]
*  Do I have omission? [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4910.4800000000005s)]
*  But you could just be like, hey, I'm super exhausted right now. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4911.52s)]
*  Can I call you back tomorrow? [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4914.72s)]
*  That's a lie. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4915.68s)]
*  Wait, what? [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4916.64s)]
*  No, what if I just don't want to talk to the person? [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4917.120000000001s)]
*  Why not? [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4919.200000000001s)]
*  Just don't feel like talking. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4920.4800000000005s)]
*  Don't pick up the phone. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4921.360000000001s)]
*  Oh, that's true. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4922.96s)]
*  But what if, OK, let's say hypothetically I picked it up. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4923.52s)]
*  I thought it was going to be a quick call, but it turns out to be longer. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4926.080000000001s)]
*  The best thing to say, even though it's hard, is to be like, [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4928.48s)]
*  you know, I'm just kind of done talking. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=4930.719999999999s)]

*  Anyway, back to what I'm trying to say. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5660.16s)]
*  If you want to have a strong, male-dominated, obedient housewife, [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5661.76s)]
*  your day starts with 200 milligrams of black rifle coffee. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5667.4400000000005s)]
*  Yes. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5670.400000000001s)]
*  Okay? [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5670.72s)]
*  Notice what color the rifle is. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5671.4400000000005s)]
*  The most messing- [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5675.360000000001s)]
*  Anyway, go to blackriflecoffee.com and use the code FLAGRANT to get 30% off. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5680.8s)]
*  Or an amount of women would get paid to do a job. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5685.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5689.28s)]
*  Today. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5689.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5690.32s)]
*  See what all the hype is about. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5690.8s)]
*  Let's get back to the show. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5692.64s)]
*  All right, what's happening with TikTok, man? [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5694.08s)]
*  Yo, is this shit done? [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5696.88s)]
*  Yeah, it seems- I mean, they're basically going back and forth, like, [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5698.72s)]
*  should we ban it, should we not? [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5701.28s)]
*  And it seems like Trump is kind of into keeping it. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5702.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5704.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, it seems kind of crazy to ban it, don't it? [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5705.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5708.0s)]
*  It's very possible it'll only be banned for several days before Trump just re-enacts it. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5708.56s)]
*  Just do a trade. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5713.360000000001s)]
*  Say, yo, China, you got to take meta. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5714.64s)]
*  And if I'm China, I'm taking that any day of the week. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5717.76s)]
*  If you look at Reels right now, I think someone was pointing this out, [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5720.4800000000005s)]
*  it's just repurposed TikToks. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5723.84s)]
*  It's like a lot of it, at least. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5726.72s)]
*  Like, I think very few people are making only Reels-specific content. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5728.8s)]
*  There are a lot of people making TikTok-specific content [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5733.52s)]
*  that goes viral when people repost on Reels. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5735.76s)]
*  So if I'm the US, I'm like, all right, listen, [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5738.240000000001s)]
*  you could have your data collection service here and influence our elections, [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5740.320000000001s)]
*  influence our culture, and do whatever the fuck you want. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5743.92s)]
*  But we got to have one over there. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5746.400000000001s)]
*  Isn't that a fair trade? [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5748.72s)]
*  What if China says no? [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5749.76s)]
*  Then I think it's reasonable that we would remove it. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5751.52s)]
*  Here's what- what does it really do? [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5754.400000000001s)]
*  Like, I imagine China already has whatever data they need. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5757.92s)]
*  And this, if anything, the fact that nobody can recreate the [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5762.0s)]
*  ByteDance algorithm in the United States proves to me that they're so far ahead of us in AI [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5765.599999999999s)]
*  in every capacity that it's like, this is the least of our concerns as a social media app. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5769.84s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5774.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5775.599999999999s)]
*  I don't know if they're ahead of us in terms of AI. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5776.24s)]
*  But nobody can get the algorithm. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5778.4s)]
*  So to me, I would assume it's under the AI umbrella. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5780.16s)]
*  I think that you can- I think that you can recreate that algorithm. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5784.0s)]
*  I think the issue is Instagram is this like friend slash community-based app. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5787.84s)]
*  So it needs to show you your friend's shit every once in a while. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5794.56s)]
*  Like they're kind of beholden to this thing that we no longer care about. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5799.200000000001s)]
*  The reality is like, we don't care about what our friends are doing [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5802.240000000001s)]
*  until the algorithm chooses something that they're doing randomly [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5804.96s)]
*  and then it throws in front of us. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5808.0s)]
*  The beauty of TikTok is they're like, people pretend like they want to keep up with the [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5809.6s)]
*  Joneses with their boys and shit. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5813.280000000001s)]
*  They don't. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5814.8s)]
*  They just want to see the next piece of content that's really interesting. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5815.360000000001s)]
*  It's really engaging. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5818.400000000001s)]
*  That's dramatic or funny. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5819.360000000001s)]
*  We got you. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5820.88s)]
*  I would push back with YouTube shorts. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5821.68s)]
*  It's big, but it's not TikTok. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5823.84s)]
*  It's not, it doesn't have that same addictive, [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5826.08s)]
*  like people are in it for 14 hours a day. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5828.08s)]
*  I agree too. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5830.32s)]
*  Forming communities. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5830.8s)]
*  I would just say that with YouTube, like the goal is a little different. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5831.68s)]
*  Like YouTube, when I hit that app, I'm like, all right, [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5836.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm going to sit here for a little bit and watch a video and kind of indulge in something. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5839.4400000000005s)]
*  Where TikTok, I even see the way my wife uses it. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5843.2s)]
*  She's brushing her teeth, throws on TikTok and just lets some shit go. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5845.84s)]
*  It's just this meaningless time spend, right? [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5849.52s)]
*  Or if you're going to bed, you're like, all right, I got 15 minutes. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5853.68s)]
*  Let me just scroll and find some shit. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5856.08s)]
*  And I think if Instagram really wants to compete, [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5857.84s)]
*  they just got to knock the friend thing away completely. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5860.88s)]
*  But people don't want that. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5863.92s)]
*  They think people don't want that. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5866.08s)]
*  We do. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5867.76s)]
*  Yeah, I just think they're further behind than you do. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5868.88s)]
*  I think that's just really where we disagree. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5871.6s)]
*  Yeah, maybe. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5872.96s)]
*  I also think, you know, the number one downloaded app the last couple of days? [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5873.52s)]
*  The backup to TikTok? [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5876.4800000000005s)]
*  The red note, which is the actual Chinese government. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5877.68s)]
*  It's a Chinese app. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5880.16s)]
*  So they're like, instead of giving it to TikTok, [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5880.88s)]
*  let's just give all our data to China right away. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5882.72s)]
*  There's a lot of pushback to this that I don't know if the government... [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5884.96s)]
*  I don't think the government understood how much people love that app. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5887.68s)]
*  And I don't think they are prepared for the anger that will come if you take it away. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5891.04s)]
*  I wonder if there's anger. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5896.16s)]
*  Like, I wonder if there's anger. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5898.0s)]
*  I wonder if people are furious or they just find another form of distraction. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5899.04s)]
*  I think they bank on that, but I think they're going to make more noise about this than most things. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5903.04s)]
*  Yeah, maybe. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5908.0s)]
*  And I don't think it's worth getting rid of it. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5909.4400000000005s)]
*  But you could see why it'd be a liability. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5911.28s)]
*  I understand the concept of it. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5913.36s)]
*  I do. I just don't think it's that real of a threat. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5915.04s)]
*  I think China is a threat, but I don't think TikTok is the reason China is a threat. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5917.84s)]
*  If we want to push China around and reassert ourselves, [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5921.4400000000005s)]
*  there's a lot of other ways to do it, I think, than just like the TikTok app. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5924.16s)]
*  What about allowing them, like, algorithmically to push certain things to us [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5927.84s)]
*  and like affect us culturally? [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5932.8s)]
*  Yeah, but Facebook, we've already... [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5934.4800000000005s)]
*  Didn't Russia already do that in 2016? [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5936.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, you could make that argument. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5938.5599999999995s)]
*  It didn't work, right? [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5940.799999999999s)]
*  But... [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5941.919999999999s)]
*  I mean, that was what... [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5942.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if that's what... [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5943.839999999999s)]
*  That's what everybody was blaming the Trump went on forever. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5945.36s)]
*  Yeah, but they always need to find a way. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5948.0s)]
*  But that's a concern either way. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5950.4s)]
*  Like, WhatsApp, there's tons of misinformation on WhatsApp. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5951.839999999999s)]
*  Take it from an Indian whose parents were sharing the craziest shit ever. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5954.639999999999s)]
*  WhatsApp is like the biggest misinformation thing in the world. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5958.5599999999995s)]
*  Really? [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5961.2s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5961.759999999999s)]
*  There's so many memes that just like... [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5962.959999999999s)]
*  Washing your hands could cause AIDS or whatever, [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5964.799999999999s)]
*  and then your uncles are just sharing it to all their uncles, [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5966.88s)]
*  and it's just going around like crazy. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5969.36s)]
*  Looking into it. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5970.639999999999s)]
*  Ah, who knows? [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5971.2s)]
*  Right? [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5972.4s)]
*  Yeah, but misinformation shit is everywhere. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5973.36s)]
*  Pushing content is like, you can do it on any app. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5976.4s)]
*  I don't think it's exclusive to TikTok. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5979.04s)]
*  But I guess the difference is that if someone is using a loophole to exploit that [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5980.48s)]
*  versus the fundamental backend being owned by another country, [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5984.16s)]
*  like is it an easier pipeline to then push a cultural agenda? [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5988.16s)]
*  I think there's no question that that is the truth. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5992.0s)]
*  I mean, that's the reason why China doesn't allow our apps over there. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5994.639999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, I can agree. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5997.679999999999s)]
*  If there is merit to it, I just think [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=5999.12s)]
*  they're kind of picking a fight with something they probably want to for whatever reason anyway. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6001.04s)]
*  Yeah, and it could just be a posturing. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6005.36s)]
*  Yeah, could be a lot of money from the US social media apps being like, [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6007.599999999999s)]
*  let's lobby, get this thing taken out of here. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6011.92s)]
*  Who's the biggest beneficiary? [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6013.5199999999995s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg and Metta, yeah. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6015.759999999999s)]
*  Did you see rumors of Elon buying it and then buying it, [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6017.759999999999s)]
*  and then Mr. Beast also saying he wants to buy it? [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6022.08s)]
*  And then China responded to that and they were like, [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6024.16s)]
*  we cannot comment on completely fictional rumors. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6026.24s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6030.5599999999995s)]
*  No, that could be them just trying to cover up the fact that they're going to sell it. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6031.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, if Elon buys TikTok and he has Twitter and TikTok, that's crazy. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6035.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6039.599999999999s)]
*  That's a lot of... [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6040.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a lot. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6041.28s)]
*  That's a lot. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6042.639999999999s)]
*  If Trump's able to save it, like does it make Trump look good? [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6043.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's an easy win early on weirdly. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6045.92s)]
*  The one demographic that he still hasn't fully won over is like young liberal kids on TikTok. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6048.4s)]
*  He saves the app they love the most. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6053.68s)]
*  What a cool... [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6056.08s)]
*  I think it's such an easy win early for him. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6056.64s)]
*  And I don't know if people looked at that because I think he's basically reversed on it. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6058.56s)]
*  He's basically saying like, I don't know if we should look into it, like think about it. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6061.92s)]
*  He loves his views on there. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6065.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6066.240000000001s)]
*  He's like, we got like 36 billion views last quarter. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6066.64s)]
*  Like, why do we got to get rid of these people? [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6068.88s)]
*  He's got TikTok jack, dude. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6070.0s)]
*  He's got the TikTok jack. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6071.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6072.8s)]
*  I think we just need to understand what the real cost to America is. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6073.92s)]
*  And then we're all just speculating right now, [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6078.4800000000005s)]
*  but if some actual independent data came out that this is potentially dangerous, [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6080.64s)]
*  and the only thing we lose is a distraction tool for five minutes, [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6086.08s)]
*  or kids are just like dancing and lip syncing, I think we can live without it. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6089.84s)]
*  But we just don't know that actual cost. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6094.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6095.76s)]
*  And if the actual cost is nothing, then let that shit go. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6096.320000000001s)]
*  Let them get their data. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6098.56s)]
*  Whatever. It's fun. It's great. We all enjoy it. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6099.4400000000005s)]
*  But if the actual cost is, oh, we found out that China influenced these local elections over here [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6101.6s)]
*  so that they could gain more influence and buy up these hotels and this real estate or whatever. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6108.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's fair. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6114.48s)]
*  If we found that there was actual real impact that was not even dangerous to Americans, but [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6115.68s)]
*  put us on the unaffected side of a negotiation, then I think it's maybe worth yanking it. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6121.36s)]
*  I wonder if even if Britain thinks about that when they're selling large swaths of real estate to [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6130.96s)]
*  outside investors, if they go long-term like, is this beneficial for us? [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6136.96s)]
*  Yeah, a few developers were able to make their money back. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6142.08s)]
*  But what does it look like 30 years from now when 20%, 30% of London is owned by foreign entities? [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6144.8s)]
*  I think this happens on such a small scale. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6151.76s)]
*  You're just an individual seller and some foreign national saying, [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6154.08s)]
*  hey, here's cash for your house. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6157.68s)]
*  New York would have stopped it. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6160.8s)]
*  So in a microcosm, I think you can look at some of the vacation destinations that impose these [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6162.8s)]
*  kind of rules where you can't buy land unless you are a citizen of the country. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6170.08s)]
*  And it's simply because you're going to price out the people who actually live there, grow up there, [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6175.84s)]
*  and don't have the opportunity to just move to another country and find a place to live. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6179.68s)]
*  And you've even seen in, I think, Vancouver, they said China bought up all these apartments. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6183.04s)]
*  Now there's this apartment shortage, and there are these apartments that are vacant, [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6186.56s)]
*  and the people that live there and actually grow up there don't have places they can stay. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6189.68s)]
*  Or they do, and they're just absurdly expensive. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6193.280000000001s)]
*  So I think there is a long-term maybe concern. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6196.240000000001s)]
*  But this is America, short-term greed. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6200.240000000001s)]
*  Somebody's willing to give you $300 million for your building, [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6203.04s)]
*  you don't go, fuck, where they're from. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6205.360000000001s)]
*  You're cashing out. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6206.64s)]
*  It's interesting with the Greenland thing too. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6208.8s)]
*  Trump trying to get Greenland and pushing hard to get it. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6211.6s)]
*  I spoke to the guy who is his ambassador to Denmark. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6214.64s)]
*  So he's essentially, Denmark is the custodian of Greenland. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6220.400000000001s)]
*  So he's essentially tasked with, I mean, the job of getting Greenland. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6224.56s)]
*  Why does Trump want it? [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6232.080000000001s)]
*  Minerals? [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6233.280000000001s)]
*  It seems like there's a couple different things from just what I've read. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6233.92s)]
*  It seems like Greenland is obviously covered in ice, and the glaciers are melting on Greenland. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6237.68s)]
*  So as a result, there's going to be huge mineral deposits and potentially even oil [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6241.4400000000005s)]
*  underneath the ground is now going to be able to be accessed. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6244.56s)]
*  Some people speculated that Elon is actually a big proponent of getting Greenland in order [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6246.64s)]
*  to get precious materials for some of the stuff he's developing and getting minerals [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6250.96s)]
*  and things like that. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6254.160000000001s)]
*  And then obviously the oil interest. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6255.360000000001s)]
*  And then there's also trade routes that are now going to be more opened up that Russia [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6256.4800000000005s)]
*  has more access to. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6259.92s)]
*  And it benefits Russia to have these trade routes. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6261.68s)]
*  So if the United States can put bases there and control the trade routes, [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6263.52s)]
*  it gives them a lot more leverage globally. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6266.240000000001s)]
*  And then thirdly, if Trump is able to get more land, [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6268.0s)]
*  does that look good for him individually as the president? [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6271.76s)]
*  I think it's a good point. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6274.32s)]
*  I think it's a good point. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6274.88s)]
*  I think it's a good point. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6275.28s)]

*  I think it's a good point. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6278.0s)]
*  If you were a citizen of Greenland [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6278.48s)]
*  and you could be Danish or American, [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6281.28s)]
*  what would you want? [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6284.96s)]
*  What's a good point? [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6285.68s)]
*  Well, it depends though, [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6286.8s)]
*  because Danes, I feel like, are probably like, [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6288.8s)]
*  and like if they're living there, [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6290.5599999999995s)]
*  if they're like culturally Danish, [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6291.36s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6293.36s)]
*  But they're culturally Greenlandish. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6293.84s)]
*  Yeah, but I imagine that they're... [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6296.32s)]
*  Influenced by Danish culture. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6297.92s)]
*  And that they're like, we're Danish. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6299.12s)]
*  I feel like I've met Danes that are very much [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6301.2s)]
*  not into the American vibe. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6303.12s)]
*  I don't know if they fit with... [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6305.12s)]
*  But that's Danes. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6305.76s)]
*  Buddy, put down the fucking butter cookies, [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6306.56s)]
*  pick up a chocolate chip, [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6308.400000000001s)]
*  see how much better it is on this side. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6309.68s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6311.200000000001s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6311.84s)]
*  We gotta put some Americans over there. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6312.320000000001s)]
*  We gotta send the boys to go, you know, colonize them. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6314.080000000001s)]
*  Give them more black people, [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6316.320000000001s)]
*  they can see how fun it is. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6317.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6318.320000000001s)]
*  And you'll make a lot of people hear very happy. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6319.200000000001s)]
*  Dude. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6325.120000000001s)]
*  That's a win-win. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6325.200000000001s)]
*  That's a win-win. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6326.0s)]
*  Should we just put Israel there? [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6326.88s)]
*  Oh, there you go. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6328.96s)]
*  That's it. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6330.320000000001s)]
*  Problem solved. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6330.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6331.92s)]
*  Well, honey, what do you feel about that? [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6332.56s)]
*  They can't handle the cold. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6333.84s)]
*  Yeah, they hate the cold. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6334.88s)]
*  They hate the cold. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6335.92s)]
*  No, they'll turn into metropolis [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6336.8s)]
*  and then be blamed again by something. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6338.16s)]
*  Now, you gotta have green, Lin-Yo. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6340.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6342.56s)]
*  I think they're Inuits. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6342.88s)]
*  Like the indigenous population there? [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6345.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6347.36s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just thinking, [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6348.88s)]
*  if I'm some Greenlandish Inuit, [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6349.68s)]
*  and that's my life, [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6353.4400000000005s)]
*  that's the only place that I've grown up, [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6355.2s)]
*  that's all I know, [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6357.4400000000005s)]
*  and I also can go to Denmark. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6359.12s)]
*  I don't even know if they have like EU citizenship. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6361.12s)]
*  I don't know how that works. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6362.88s)]
*  Or you could be the exact person you're gonna be, [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6364.88s)]
*  but if you wanna pop down to Miami [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6368.32s)]
*  for a few weeks in the winter, [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6369.92s)]
*  there's no red tape at all. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6370.96s)]
*  If you wanna start a business in New York, [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6372.4s)]
*  there's no red tape at all. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6374.0s)]
*  That should be the deal that they bring. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6374.64s)]
*  Yeah, it depends how the economy is. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6376.0s)]
*  If they're doing bad, then they're gonna want to. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6377.6s)]
*  They're gonna wanna choose. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6379.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6380.48s)]
*  There's only like 100,000 of them. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6380.8s)]
*  And I think one of the big issues [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6383.44s)]
*  that they're running into right now is that they want, [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6385.36s)]
*  basically Greenland's like empty. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6388.64s)]
*  It's just a big like beautiful, like untouched land, [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6389.92s)]
*  and their fear is that America is gonna come and touch it. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6393.2s)]
*  So I think a lot of- [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6395.84s)]
*  Why would they think that? [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6396.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6397.36s)]
*  Why have we done that before? [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=6397.84s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7115.32s)]
*  What's that pussy look like afterwards? [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7116.04s)]
*  Was it all the same? [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7118.36s)]
*  It had to be vagina. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7119.88s)]
*  I mean, maybe she was sucking some of them. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7122.28s)]
*  Oh. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7124.2s)]
*  Like is that... [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7124.36s)]
*  But that shouldn't count. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7124.84s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think that counts. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7125.72s)]
*  That should count though. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7127.88s)]
*  That should count for two to be honest with you. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7129.4800000000005s)]
*  That doesn't count. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7131.4s)]
*  All right, so what do you guys think about that? [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7133.24s)]
*  I mean, has she spoken on it? [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7135.56s)]
*  Has she said how fucking awful she feels or anything like that? [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7137.08s)]
*  She broke a thousand and then there was just 57 people left and she was like, [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7142.84s)]
*  ah, run it up, apparently. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7146.84s)]
*  She's a real path. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7148.360000000001s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7149.0s)]
*  That's kind of sick. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7149.56s)]
*  But I mean, if sex means nothing, then why is this different than like a hot dog eating contest? [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7150.4400000000005s)]
*  Because it's getting fucked in your vagina contest. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7154.52s)]
*  Yeah, just putting food in your mouth contest. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7157.56s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7159.72s)]
*  It's like, if it's just an act that people do that doesn't have any type of social bearing, [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7160.12s)]
*  it doesn't really matter who you do it with. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7164.280000000001s)]
*  No, I... [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7166.4400000000005s)]
*  Fucking liberal cuckoo. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7166.84s)]
*  I disagree. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7168.52s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7169.16s)]
*  I understand. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7169.56s)]
*  If culturally we view sex just like, yeah, who gives a fuck, do it with whoever, then [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7171.08s)]
*  why is it? [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7174.92s)]
*  Why are people defying it? [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7175.639999999999s)]
*  It's difficult for us because we don't view sex like that entirely. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7176.76s)]
*  Like there's a number where if you go past it, then sex is this emotional beautiful act. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7180.84s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7187.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7187.8s)]
*  Like if somebody went down to Columbia, there was a friend of ours and fucked like four girls in a [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7188.5199999999995s)]
*  night, we wouldn't be like, oh, that's disgusting. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7193.48s)]
*  Like how could you ruin the sanctity of this beautiful connection that you could have with [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7195.5599999999995s)]
*  another person? [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7200.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7200.599999999999s)]
*  But then if one of our boys fucked a thousand girls in Columbia, he's got eights, right? [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7201.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7206.36s)]
*  Like there's like a concern at a certain point, right? [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7206.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7208.76s)]
*  He's dead. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7209.0s)]
*  So what is the number that it becomes a pathology? [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7209.24s)]
*  That's we should... [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7212.12s)]
*  I think for girls, it's like two. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7212.84s)]
*  Simultaneous? [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7216.28s)]
*  If girls have sex with more than one guy in a night, that you're a whore forever. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7217.24s)]
*  Isn't that sad? [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7226.36s)]
*  Isn't that sad knowing that you've helped that happen? [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7227.32s)]
*  But it is a girl. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7233.719999999999s)]
*  Like what is the number? [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7234.679999999999s)]
*  Like what is the number for your girl if she told you a story and she was like, [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7235.799999999999s)]
*  oh, it was some crazy night in college and there was like five guys and it was just like... [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7240.599999999999s)]
*  Right? [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7245.5599999999995s)]
*  What do you do? [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7247.4s)]
*  You have to break up. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7248.2s)]
*  Like what do you do? [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7249.08s)]
*  Oh yeah, we're done. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7249.719999999999s)]
*  You're done, right? [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7251.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7252.04s)]
*  You're done. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7253.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7253.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7254.2s)]
*  Two guys. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7255.48s)]
*  It was a crazy night. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7256.12s)]
*  Two guys. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7257.08s)]
*  I'm out. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7257.72s)]
*  Kyle, you're done. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7258.68s)]
*  I'm out. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7259.64s)]
*  I mean, you know our answer. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7260.76s)]
*  Yeah, I'm out. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7261.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7262.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7262.68s)]
*  It's a crazy guy. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7263.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7263.72s)]
*  It's a crazy guy. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7264.84s)]
*  We dated for four years. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7265.5599999999995s)]
*  I've been like, gross. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7266.5199999999995s)]
*  What the fuck? [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7268.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of more than one ladies is the cutoff. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7269.32s)]
*  But for guys... [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7272.84s)]
*  Well, we can only have sex with one at a time. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7274.599999999999s)]
*  Speak for yourself. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7278.2s)]
*  Meaning like, I can't fuck you while I'm fucking somebody else. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7280.12s)]
*  But now you're talking about DP. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7284.6s)]
*  If the girl's having sex with two guys, [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7285.72s)]
*  she's only having sex with one guy at a time. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7287.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's even worse. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7288.76s)]
*  That's crazy what you just said. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7289.72s)]
*  I mean, that's crazy. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7291.16s)]
*  What the fuck did you just say? [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7293.16s)]
*  I'm just trying to understand the logistics of it. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7294.84s)]
*  Yeah, I'm done. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7299.16s)]
*  Come on, man. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7299.96s)]
*  He sure is stupid. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7300.6s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7301.4s)]
*  Guys gonna have sex with one girl at one time. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7302.12s)]
*  No, but like... [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7303.64s)]
*  Girls gonna have sex with one guy. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7303.96s)]
*  The sex is putting dick in, right? [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7305.8s)]
*  I can only put dick in one. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7308.2s)]
*  But if a girl's getting up the ass and in the pussy at the same time, [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7309.72s)]
*  just like, what the hell's wrong with you? [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7313.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7314.4400000000005s)]
*  Or if you're like, a dick is in her mouth while a dick is in her vagina. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7315.56s)]
*  That's insane. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7319.4800000000005s)]
*  And I've done that with girls. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7321.72s)]
*  And even during it, I'm like, yo, you are a fucking... [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7325.0s)]
*  Why would you do this? [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7328.4400000000005s)]
*  This is crazy. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7329.4800000000005s)]
*  This is an insane decision that you made completely sober. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7330.68s)]
*  You were really enthusiastic about. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7336.84s)]
*  Did you think we think this is cool? [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7338.76s)]
*  We're gonna call you a whore forever. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7340.4400000000005s)]
*  Why would you do this? [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7342.84s)]
*  What are you doing? [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7344.76s)]
*  You know? [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7347.0s)]
*  Do you think my mom's still listening? [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7348.04s)]
*  I think she would agree with our perspective on this part. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7351.400000000001s)]
*  So what is the takeaway from this? [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7355.16s)]
*  Like, do these girls fuck enough guys at one time [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7357.96s)]
*  where even like regular promiscuous girls start going, oh, it is kind of gross. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7360.92s)]
*  Yeah, 1000%. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7364.68s)]
*  Are they gonna ruin promiscuity? [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7365.8s)]
*  Our generation or me and Al's generation benefited from sexual liberty. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7369.16s)]
*  Like, we were able to meet girls and have sex with them [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7373.8s)]
*  and there wasn't that big a deal because it was more transactional, like you said. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7376.44s)]
*  But are these girls proving that that's actually disgusting [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7379.8s)]
*  and guys actually think that's disgusting? [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7382.84s)]
*  Or you just recalibrate the number at which you're a whore. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7384.28s)]
*  Now you just raised it. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7386.76s)]
*  We're desensitized. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7387.96s)]

*  you know, the ones that were waiting for fucking bad bunny, a bad Bobby to turn 18. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7656.7s)]
*  Bad baby. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7661.98s)]
*  Bad baby. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7662.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7663.179999999999s)]
*  To turn 18 and then her fucking gram goes crazy. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7663.5s)]
*  I'm like, so that means Joe looking at her at 17. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7666.62s)]
*  Countdown. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7669.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7669.74s)]
*  Oh, this might not be. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7669.98s)]
*  So that shit is nasty. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7670.62s)]
*  Anybody those types of pages, I should. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7671.98s)]
*  But is this girl 18 years old or is she? [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7675.179999999999s)]
*  I believe this is the girl that's. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7678.46s)]
*  Oh, this is not the girl I. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7679.98s)]
*  Sophie Rain. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7680.94s)]
*  She's 20, it says. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7681.98s)]
*  So she's 20 years old, very attractive girl, and she's a virgin. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7683.179999999999s)]
*  But I imagine she shows, you know, sexy pics or whatever. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7688.139999999999s)]
*  That's genius, actually. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7691.58s)]
*  But like, what does this say about the male psyche? [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7693.099999999999s)]
*  There's far more interest in a girl who is beautiful and not fucking [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7697.339999999999s)]
*  than there is in a girl who is fucking everyone. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7703.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's just the human psyche. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7707.82s)]
*  You want something that not everybody has access to. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7711.0199999999995s)]
*  But they technically have access to the look, right? [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7713.419999999999s)]
*  Like if she's showing her boobs, et cetera. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7716.62s)]
*  I'm not trying to discredit point. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7718.46s)]
*  I agree with you. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7719.419999999999s)]
*  But like, so we're OK with you showing off your body. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7719.98s)]
*  That to us isn't disgusting. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7724.299999999999s)]
*  It's the second things enter it. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7727.339999999999s)]
*  I think we can justify it also because there is an idea of purity attached to her. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7729.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7733.339999999999s)]
*  She's showing off her body, but she's still pure, [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7734.0599999999995s)]
*  pure than us. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7736.3s)]
*  She's never had sex. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7736.860000000001s)]
*  So how am I allowed to indulge in this guilt free and not feel like, oh, this is [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7738.14s)]
*  I'm participating in this blah, blah, blah. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7742.9400000000005s)]
*  This is an empowered girl. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7745.02s)]
*  She holds on to her morals, does something she's comfortable with. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7746.06s)]
*  I feel no guilt. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7748.9400000000005s)]
*  She's hot. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7749.740000000001s)]
*  Let's go. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7750.3s)]
*  Guilt free. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7750.860000000001s)]
*  It's guilt free. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7752.3s)]
*  Wow. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7754.38s)]
*  She's more attractive because she's holding on to her chastity. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7754.7s)]
*  So it's like a commodity. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7757.1s)]
*  Yes, she does. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7758.62s)]
*  You don't feel that same like the other girl. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7759.58s)]
*  You feel gross. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7761.1s)]
*  You're like, what did this poor girl go through? [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7761.58s)]
*  They're like sex means nothing to her. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7763.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7764.780000000001s)]
*  It's like dapping somebody up. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7765.18s)]
*  This other girl, we'd like to believe that she didn't go through that. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7767.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7770.780000000001s)]
*  She's just a super hot girl. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7771.42s)]
*  She's making money off OnlyFans because guys want to see her naked. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7772.780000000001s)]
*  But that is way more desire. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7776.46s)]
*  Guys are paying money to have fake conversations with her on OnlyFans. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7778.14s)]
*  To the tune of $40 million, this girl had to fuck a thousand guys for us to talk about [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7781.900000000001s)]
*  her on the pod and we still don't even know her name. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7787.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7790.06s)]
*  And it's not like the Sophie Rain girl is like that much more beautiful than the other girl. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7791.26s)]
*  They're both hot girls. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7795.820000000001s)]
*  They're both hot girls. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7796.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7797.66s)]
*  And the only reason we're talking about the 1000 guy girl is because she did something [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7799.58s)]
*  that we think is disgusting. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7804.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7806.22s)]
*  We're not going, oh my gosh, she's beautiful. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7806.54s)]
*  They're paying $40 million for this virgin because they're like, holy shit, [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7808.46s)]
*  look how hot this girl is. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7811.34s)]
*  She somehow managed to be this hot and not have sex. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7813.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7818.22s)]
*  Yeah, I think men are drawn to the scope, right? [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7819.42s)]
*  It's ultra purity and chastity while still being seductive and teasing. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7823.34s)]
*  And then the other side is full degradation. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7826.94s)]
*  And I think that that is splitting the male psyche. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7829.82s)]
*  But are there guys that are into the fact that she's fucked all these dudes? [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7832.94s)]
*  Are they like a kink for them? [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7836.06s)]
*  I mean, certainly. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7837.74s)]
*  I imagine that that is a part of it. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7838.46s)]
*  I mean, I think that's kind of part of most porn, to be honest with you. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7839.9800000000005s)]
*  It's like there is a degraded element where seeing beautiful woman be degraded is validating for men. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7842.54s)]
*  So I think that is taking it to its farthest logical conclusion. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7848.46s)]
*  Apparently Bonnie Blue is making, the girl who had sex with a thousand people, [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7852.3s)]
*  is making $700,000 a month. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7855.66s)]
*  Wow. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7858.54s)]
*  And she did a thing in November of 2023 where she went around to British colleges [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7859.42s)]
*  and slept with any student if she could post it online. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7865.58s)]
*  Wild. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7872.54s)]
*  Different times, man. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7873.18s)]
*  So I think it is that polar, like, poll kind of thing. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7874.7s)]
*  Wow. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7880.54s)]
*  40 million. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7881.18s)]
*  That's three and a half million a month. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7881.9800000000005s)]
*  That's impressive. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7883.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7885.1s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7885.58s)]
*  What a world. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7887.58s)]
*  She's making more money than Jaylen Hurtz. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7889.02s)]
*  Isn't that fucking crazy? [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7892.780000000001s)]
*  That is wild. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7895.740000000001s)]
*  That's fucking crazy. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7896.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7898.46s)]
*  Wait, what is this contract? [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7899.34s)]
*  It's probably around the same, but just like an NFL quarterback. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7900.54s)]
*  She's getting paid like a good NFL quarterback. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7903.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7907.18s)]
*  No CTE, no sex even. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7907.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7910.38s)]
*  Do we believe she's a virgin? [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7911.58s)]
*  The only reason I believe it is because she's made so much money [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7914.22s)]
*  having virginity attached to it that there would be some dude if he smashed [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7920.06s)]
*  that would come out and be like, nah, I hit it. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7924.14s)]
*  Like think about how many dudes came out and they were talking shit about Travis Hunter and his. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7926.38s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7931.02s)]
*  Right? [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7931.66s)]
*  Like it wasn't every dude who DM'd her like, oh, look, she's in my DM. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7931.9s)]
*  Like there's a pile on. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7936.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7939.74s)]
*  Or some hating ass bitch would be like, oh, no, one of my friends slept with her. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7940.38s)]
*  She's lying. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7944.0599999999995s)]
*  She shouldn't make all that money. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7944.7s)]
*  Yeah, there's something unsettling about this. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7949.98s)]
*  It's because you have a daughter now, dude. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7954.86s)]
*  You think that's something to think about? [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7956.86s)]
*  As you twist your wedding ring and concern. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7959.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7961.82s)]
*  Fuck. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7963.5s)]
*  Like you want to talk to her and figure out what the fuck happened. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7964.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7968.7s)]
*  I need to know why it's so meaningless. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=7969.34s)]

*  and benefit your country. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8262.460000000001s)]
*  Now you're a hero. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8263.58s)]
*  But if you're willing to bang a thousand guys, you got, I don't know, if you can honeypot. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8264.380000000001s)]
*  Say, hey, what did you learn from the Taliban? [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8268.14s)]
*  They're like, I sucked off a bunch of them. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8269.82s)]
*  Did you make it the main guy? [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8272.06s)]
*  She's like, no, I was sucking off the other guy. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8273.02s)]
*  No, but they canceled all their terrorism plans. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8274.380000000001s)]
*  They're pretty relaxed right now. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8276.06s)]
*  I'm pretty sure it's been used as a warfare tactic. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8278.14s)]
*  I'm pretty sure the US did that. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8280.14s)]

*  Happy fucking New Year. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8299.74s)]
*  $20 million. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8300.7s)]
*  Would you, A, suck a dick to completion, or B, get a Dubai porta potty? [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8301.58s)]
*  Take a second and think about it, because it'll reveal a lot of shit about your home. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8307.34s)]
*  As you thought you knew that you... [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8310.220000000001s)]
*  It's news to you. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8312.86s)]
*  I don't know what that says about me, but shit on my chest, no question over sucking a dick. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8313.66s)]
*  Yeah, that's probably true. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8319.02s)]
*  It's just so degrading. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8319.82s)]
*  Yeah, you know, degrading sucking a guy's dick to completion. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8322.86s)]
*  Not really. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8325.34s)]
*  And then we wonder why wives don't do it. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8326.220000000001s)]
*  We can't perpetuate this. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8327.58s)]
*  I don't think it's that degrading. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8328.94s)]
*  I think it's a pretty normal thing. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8330.380000000001s)]
*  It's gross because it's gay. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8333.1s)]
*  But outside of that, it's not like... [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8334.94s)]
*  It's not like a degrading act. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8336.7s)]
*  Would you rather suck the dick? [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8339.1s)]
*  No, I'm going to get shit on. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8340.7s)]
*  But it's not super degrading. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8342.94s)]
*  It's not degrading. [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8345.02s)]
*  Shitting on... [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8346.78s)]
*  Then also, I would rather have someone shit on my back. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8347.42s)]
*  Oh, obviously, but that's not a choice here. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8350.300000000001s)]
*  You don't have that choice. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8351.900000000001s)]
*  Well, maybe I could negotiate for that. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8353.740000000002s)]
*  Yeah, 10 million. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8355.26s)]
*  You could charm him. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8355.900000000001s)]
*  10 million. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8356.460000000001s)]
*  You could probably charm him. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8356.62s)]
*  My back's actually better. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8358.94s)]
*  Yeah, so much better. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8359.900000000001s)]
*  Well, then maybe you could negotiate just kissing the dick and not sucking it. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8361.58s)]
*  Oh, I'd kiss the dick for 20 million. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8364.78s)]
*  You see, if you would... [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8366.62s)]
*  I don't think kissing a dick just like, nah. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8367.820000000002s)]
*  I don't think that that's gay unless they nut immediately upon kissing it. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8371.26s)]
*  That's gay on them. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8374.62s)]
*  That would be a surprise. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8376.060000000001s)]
*  That would be a surprise. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8377.18s)]
*  Like, part of you that was flattering... [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8377.660000000002s)]
*  You could kiss the side, the shaft, and then avoid any bust. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8379.740000000002s)]
*  But what if you kiss the side and then just shot? [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8383.1s)]
*  Like that. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8385.1s)]
*  Like, would you look at your wife differently and be like, yo, how do you... [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8385.580000000002s)]
*  Like, I'm nice, bro. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8387.980000000001s)]
*  Like, what are you doing that I'm not doing? [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8388.78s)]
*  What am I doing that you're not doing? [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8391.580000000002s)]
*  What am I doing that you're not doing? [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8393.74s)]
*  I just kiss the side of it. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8394.94s)]
*  You could teach a course, make another 20 million. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8396.38s)]
*  Probably. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8398.7s)]
*  Also, is sucking dick for 20 million even gay? [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8399.58s)]
*  I don't even know if it's gay. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8401.34s)]
*  No. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8402.22s)]
*  That's some gay shit to say though. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8402.94s)]
*  It's not gay. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8404.46s)]
*  I don't think it's gay if it's for 20 million dollars. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8405.34s)]
*  The problem is the motion of moving your head up and down on a dick is super gay. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8407.82s)]
*  I'll never get that out of your head. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8412.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8413.66s)]
*  Never get that out of your head. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8415.66s)]
*  It's out of my... [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8416.3s)]
*  Oh, fuck, it's back in my head. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8416.7s)]
*  I tried to get it out. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8417.74s)]
*  See? [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8418.62s)]
*  I tried to get it out. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8419.12s)]
*  Every time you spend that money, you're spending gay dollars. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8419.66s)]
*  We're gonna let that out of your head. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8422.619999999999s)]
*  I'm just gonna keep on seeing it. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8423.34s)]
*  Hey, dude, it's in your head and it'll be there forever. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8424.3s)]
*  Whose dick is it? [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8427.82s)]
*  I can't even look up. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8428.46s)]
*  Oh, don't even start that. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8429.18s)]
*  Your dad's. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8431.5s)]
*  Oh, no. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8432.14s)]
*  Why did you do that? [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8432.779999999999s)]
*  Get it out of my head, bro. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8435.019999999999s)]
*  Stop. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8436.3s)]
*  Let's change the topic. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8436.779999999999s)]
*  Have you seen your dad's meet? [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8437.58s)]
*  Not recently. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8439.18s)]
*  No, but like as a child, would you see it swinging around in the house? [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8439.9s)]
*  Never in the house, but I do have a memory of showering and I think it was that memory. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8442.619999999999s)]
*  My dad was like, all right, we're done. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8446.3s)]
*  We would shower together and I'd go on a towel and I'd sit on the side. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8448.699999999999s)]
*  When I was done showering, then he would finish and I have like one memory of that. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8451.82s)]
*  And I think that was like the exact age. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8455.26s)]
*  My dad was like, all right, you're four years old. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8456.94s)]
*  We can't do this. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8458.3s)]
*  Wait, why? [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8459.18s)]
*  Once your kid makes memories, you can't be showering with them. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8461.18s)]
*  Oh, oh, got it. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8463.1s)]
*  Got it. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8463.98s)]
*  Got it. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8464.22s)]
*  Do you shower with your dad? [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8465.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8466.94s)]
*  That's weird. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8467.34s)]
*  Right? [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8469.18s)]
*  That's not weird. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8469.5s)]

*  That's not weird. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8471.66s)]

*  I ran to leave. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8535.34s)]
*  I was like three years old. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8536.86s)]
*  Why was your dad still showering? [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8537.82s)]
*  Why did you get out? [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8539.66s)]
*  It's cold outside the shower. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8540.54s)]
*  Was he washing you up? [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8541.9s)]

*  He's popping the shower, bro. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8549.74s)]
*  It's a shower. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8550.62s)]
*  It's hard to put your hands just in the shower. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8551.34s)]
*  So my dad had done that. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8553.82s)]
*  I remember my dad doing that. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8555.1s)]
*  Yes, it's very easy to do that. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8556.86s)]
*  So he would get in the shower. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8559.1s)]
*  And then he would bust. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8560.14s)]
*  They're like, whoa. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8562.54s)]
*  No. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8563.9s)]
*  Get it out of my head. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8565.039999999999s)]
*  Bro, stop. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8565.92s)]
*  You're sitting there. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8566.96s)]

*  You're sitting there. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8568.08s)]

*  Al, we got to be serious about it. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8590.4s)]
*  So you're sitting there and your dad's just fucking peeking away. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8592.48s)]
*  Either it's normal or it's traumatic. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8595.84s)]

*  He's making all sorts of sounds. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8599.44s)]
*  So his elbow's banging to the glass. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8604.08s)]
*  And you're just sitting there with the towel after all. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8609.119999999999s)]
*  You're drying off. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8611.199999999999s)]

*  I had a little kid towel and the hood on. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BY435eZIjI&t=8612.88s)]
