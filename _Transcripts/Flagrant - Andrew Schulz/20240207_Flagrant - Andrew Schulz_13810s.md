# Russ Reveals How Artists FAKE Streams, Who To Blame For Juice WRLD Death & Secrets of Music Industry
**Flagrant - Andrew Schulz:** [February 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA)
*  Why do the labels make the artists do those boardroom performances? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=0.0s)]
*  Here's how those go. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4.1s)]
*  Who's the most fake? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5.7s)]
*  Of course you're gonna lose the art, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6.2s)]
*  because people aren't doing it for the art anymore, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  they're doing it for the bad. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9.4s)]
*  This is not me speculating. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10.4s)]
*  This is me talking to like, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  top five most streamed artists in the world, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13.5s)]
*  and them talking to CEOs and CEOs admitting, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=15.8s)]
*  and me on the phone with like, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=18.6s)]
*  the dude who fakes the stream. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=20.0s)]
*  Nicky spoke on Future saying when I talked to Future, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=21.3s)]
*  he told me he wasn't even doing the drugs that he talks about. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=24.0s)]
*  I think Future's music is amazing, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=26.6s)]
*  but I also know that the reason why I wanted to try lean when I was 19, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=28.4s)]
*  was Future. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=32.4s)]
*  We have seen it live in the flesh. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=33.3s)]
*  Juice WRLD said, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=35.0s)]
*  I did drugs because of you. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=35.8s)]
*  Juice WRLD died of a drug overdose by following somebody who does not even do the drugs that they said they did. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=37.5s)]
*  It's y'all's fault for believing it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=43.1s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=44.5s)]
*  Start at chapter one. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=45.0s)]
*  Why are you perpetuating something you're not doing? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=45.9s)]
*  Bro, when this throws out, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=47.9s)]
*  I'm getting flamed. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=49.3s)]
*  What's up everybody? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=51.4s)]
*  Welcome to Flay Grant. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=52.099999999999994s)]
*  Now listen, if you hate seeing stand-up clips all over the internet, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=53.099999999999994s)]
*  we have brought the man that's responsible for that on the podcast today. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=57.2s)]
*  Give it up for Russ, everybody. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=61.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  What an extra. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=62.900000000000006s)]
*  Russ, fast. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=63.5s)]
*  I've given you your flowers for this, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=64.3s)]
*  so you know the story, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=66.10000000000001s)]
*  and I talk about this quite often. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=67.2s)]
*  But retell it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=68.5s)]
*  We have it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=69.4s)]
*  There's never enough flowers. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=70.7s)]
*  But no, I remember watching an interview with you, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=72.4s)]
*  and you saying that you were putting out a song a week, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=74.9s)]
*  and at that point in my life, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=77.60000000000001s)]
*  I was like, man, I'm not working hard enough. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=78.60000000000001s)]
*  This guy's putting a whole fucking song out a week. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=80.0s)]
*  You got to write the music for it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=81.80000000000001s)]
*  You got to write the lyrics. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=83.5s)]
*  You got to do it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=84.2s)]
*  And I could put a joke out a week, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=84.80000000000001s)]
*  and I started doing that. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=86.10000000000001s)]
*  I started getting success, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=86.9s)]
*  and I tried to tell as many comedians as possible about it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=87.7s)]
*  And now they stand up all over the internet, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=90.10000000000001s)]
*  so you deserve credit for that. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=92.10000000000001s)]
*  So we just want to say thank you for putting us on to the hustle. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=93.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=97.30000000000001s)]
*  And there's a lot of things I want to talk to you about. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  I'm very excited to finally have you on the pod. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=100.2s)]
*  A lot of music industry stuff, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=103.0s)]
*  a lot of personal stuff in your music. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=104.30000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=105.80000000000001s)]
*  But before that, I need you to explain to us something. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=106.10000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=109.30000000000001s)]
*  Why is it, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=110.80000000000001s)]
*  because you're uniquely positioned in the music world where, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  I don't feel like you're really indebted to anybody but the fans, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=116.6s)]
*  so you can kind of talk shit about the labels, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=119.0s)]
*  and then you could talk shit about the artists, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=122.1s)]
*  and the artists that are indebted to the labels can't say shit, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  and the people that work at the labels can't say shit, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=127.89999999999999s)]
*  but you can. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=129.79999999999998s)]
*  Why do the labels make the artists do those boardroom performances? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=131.6s)]
*  Is that like a... [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=135.9s)]
*  I don't think the crazy thing is, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=136.5s)]
*  I don't think they make them do the performances. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=139.1s)]
*  Here's how those go. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=141.0s)]
*  Please explain this. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=142.0s)]
*  The reality is when you get signed to a label, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=143.9s)]
*  or you're trying to get signed to a label, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=147.4s)]
*  in a way to sort of like show you how much artillery we have, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=150.5s)]
*  and how much we fuck with you. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=156.70000000000002s)]
*  They bring the whole team. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=157.9s)]
*  We have digital in here, we have radio. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=159.0s)]
*  They bring the whole staff, right? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=161.9s)]
*  And they sit them around this long table. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=164.5s)]
*  Yo, this is crazy. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=165.9s)]
*  And they play favorite clips. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=166.8s)]
*  Bobby wanted that label fact. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=169.10000000000002s)]
*  It's like, here's the thing, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=170.70000000000002s)]
*  it's like they play your music, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=171.4s)]
*  so it's like, I've done that meeting, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=173.1s)]
*  but like a sane individual, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=175.5s)]
*  I sat at the table. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=177.7s)]
*  You didn't get up at any point? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=179.5s)]
*  No, and like we just listened to the music. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=180.8s)]
*  So now some people like want to stand on the table and go nuts, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=183.2s)]
*  which is like, that's their prerogative. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=187.9s)]
*  That's what's up. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=189.2s)]
*  But to me, yeah, I mean, it's like those people aren't like, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=189.7s)]
*  they're not there to fuck with you really. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=193.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=195.0s)]
*  So like doing all that is not going to make the deal better. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=195.3s)]
*  So you can just sit in that level of awkwardness. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=198.1s)]
*  Like if somebody played my stand-up for me, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=200.2s)]
*  I don't know if I'd be confident enough to perform it for them. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=202.4s)]
*  But like I'd be like, can we not sit here for this? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  Back then for me, it's like I was just, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=209.1s)]
*  I mean, what was I, 23 when I partnered. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=211.29999999999998s)]
*  So it's like I was in a different headspace of like so, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=213.5s)]
*  so like beyond arrogant, you know, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=219.2s)]
*  like just so gung-ho on my shit that I was like, fuck yeah, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=222.9s)]
*  y'all should be playing my show. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=226.2s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=228.1s)]
*  So yeah, I mean, I definitely never like stood on the table. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=228.7s)]
*  That never crossed my mind when I saw that. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=232.0s)]
*  It also is just like, bro, like these people don't care like that. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=236.9s)]
*  Like so you're standing on the table. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=241.4s)]
*  It's almost like that's not going to make them like go harder for you. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=242.6s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=247.3s)]
*  Like it's not. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=248.0s)]
*  Yeah, they got a house, their kids at private school. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=248.8s)]
*  It's a job and it's also musical chairs in the business. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=250.6s)]
*  It's like that person you're like doing all that performing [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=253.0s)]
*  and all that like trying to get them on your side, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=256.6s)]
*  or whatever you're trying to do, they could be gone next week. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=259.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=261.9s)]
*  They don't give a fuck. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=263.4s)]
*  It's like conspiracy that people be like, oh, this is like a humiliation ritual. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=264.79999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, no, that is that is a choice. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=267.79999999999995s)]
*  The truth is always a personal choice that these people are making. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=272.9s)]
*  The truth is always way more boring. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=275.9s)]
*  That's what I realized. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=277.2s)]
*  Like I'd rather almost believe it was a humiliating. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=277.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=280.09999999999997s)]
*  Let's just believe it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=280.4s)]
*  I don't believe it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=281.09999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=281.5s)]
*  Yeah, good. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=282.09999999999997s)]
*  Russ is dancing on that video coming out. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=283.9s)]
*  And there's a video of you doing it. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=287.09999999999997s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=290.09999999999997s)]
*  We need all the dirt. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=290.3s)]
*  Like obviously, I want to talk about Santiago. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=291.0s)]
*  I want to talk about the new single coming out. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=292.5s)]
*  And I was telling you before we did the pie, like it was it was truly beautiful. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=294.0s)]
*  Like go listen to the album because I think it took a lot of emotional work to get there. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=298.8s)]
*  I want to I want to save a time where we can have a long form discussion about that. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=302.8s)]
*  But again, unique experience here. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=306.7s)]
*  And I want to know the dirt. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=309.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=310.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=310.90000000000003s)]
*  How are these labels fucking artists with the streams? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=311.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=314.90000000000003s)]
*  I don't know how they're doing it, but it feels like they're doing it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=315.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=317.8s)]
*  And how are they tricking us? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=318.1s)]
*  Because I see these people that go crazy. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=319.90000000000003s)]
*  Album goes number one, but then they can't fill up a show. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=322.3s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=325.8s)]
*  So the math is not math. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=326.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=328.40000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=329.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=330.1s)]
*  I mean, that's what it is. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=330.3s)]
*  Well, explain it. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=332.20000000000005s)]
*  Where I mean, so it's it's it's one of those things that like everyone in the industry knows is going on. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=333.0s)]
*  Which is faking the streams. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=339.5s)]
*  It's a real thing. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=342.1s)]
*  So the label buys the streams from Spotify. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=343.1s)]
*  So here's the deal when you talk to these people because I've talked to these people because I've been like, what's what is this? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=345.5s)]
*  How y'all doing this? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=350.8s)]
*  They never disclose the mechanics of like how they actually fake the streams. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=351.6s)]
*  There's like, you know, rumors of like streaming farms or we're delving out fucking computers in third world countries and hacking the back end to make it look like it's an IP from the uf. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=356.5s)]
*  Whatever like all this nutty shit. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=369.3s)]
*  But the reality is the labels are spending money and you know, that was advocate. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=370.6s)]
*  They're treating it like a marketing expense because in a sense it like almost is you're going to spend a hundred grand on billboards. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=378.90000000000003s)]
*  You're going to spend a hundred grand on streams. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=383.90000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=385.40000000000003s)]
*  What's streams is going to put you in a playlist. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=386.20000000000005s)]
*  You're going to spend real money to get fake streams that equate to real money. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=388.5s)]
*  So that's why they think it makes sense because it's like, okay, the streams are fake, but the money's real. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=393.20000000000005s)]
*  So what do we care? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=399.6s)]
*  Especially they're not doing it with like up and coming artists who like you wouldn't believe it, you know, they're doing it with people like where it's okay. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=400.6s)]
*  If you're let's say your song has 500 million streams, right organically, but let's say with fake streams. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=409.1s)]
*  Now you have 900 million. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=416.3s)]
*  No one's going to sit there and be like, this is more like a 500 million stream. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=418.1s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=422.40000000000003s)]
*  They're just going to be like, this is a big song. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=423.70000000000005s)]
*  Make sense. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=425.0s)]
*  It has 900 million. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=425.40000000000003s)]
*  Honestly, so smart. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=426.5s)]
*  Yeah, they're not like they're not doing it to the dude across the street and giving him a billion streams. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=427.6s)]
*  They're doing it to people who really can get half a billion, but let's just pump it to get 900. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=432.1s)]
*  Now you get number one. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=439.0s)]
*  Now you get number one. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=440.20000000000005s)]
*  So you can pay for a number one. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=440.90000000000003s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=442.1s)]
*  What? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=442.8s)]
*  What does the number one cost? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=443.20000000000005s)]
*  I mean, that's crazy to even think about. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=446.0s)]
*  I mean, what does a number one song in America cost? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=447.6s)]
*  Look, the reality is this. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=450.70000000000005s)]
*  You do have to have a real fan base to a certain extent. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=452.20000000000005s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=455.0s)]
*  You have to have people who are really consuming the music. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=455.40000000000003s)]
*  And your song has to actually be moving around organically. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=458.0s)]
*  Once it's that, then they'll push the button on it. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=462.0s)]
*  And it just depends. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=465.3s)]
*  Like it's a campaign. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=466.5s)]
*  It could be like it's like a 12-week campaign and it might be 60 grand, 70 grand, whatever it is. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=467.5s)]
*  That's it. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=473.7s)]
*  And it's oh, yeah. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=474.3s)]
*  To have the number one song. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=475.2s)]
*  And that 70 grand, the ROI is crazy because that 70 grand might bring you back 200, 300. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=476.2s)]
*  Yeah, and even just seeing the song number one, you're more likely to check it out. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=481.3s)]
*  Now, how so? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=485.0s)]
*  Because people are cheap. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=485.9s)]
*  And it's just... [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=487.3s)]
*  Yeah, if you see something successful. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=488.0s)]
*  Labels are like all CEOs at labels are obsessed with market share. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=489.5s)]
*  Like who has the market share? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=495.1s)]
*  Sony has 25%. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=496.90000000000003s)]
*  Market share means the amount of streamed songs at that moment. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=498.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=504.0s)]
*  Of all total streams, how many percent more? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=504.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=506.3s)]
*  And there's like bonuses that are associated with it. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=507.2s)]
*  Oh, because that's their incentive structure. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=509.3s)]
*  If you're number one, you're going to get the trickle down. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=511.1s)]
*  So they're going to try to boost. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=513.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=514.9s)]
*  Now, maybe you can't quantify it, but you said you can't do it with any song. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=516.4s)]
*  You could take it from number 10 to number one, or you got to be like three and then... [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=519.6s)]
*  No, I mean, look, Spotify even just put out this statement that said anything over what? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=523.4s)]
*  Was it 80% and 90%? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=530.1s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=531.8s)]
*  Anything over 90? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=532.6999999999999s)]
*  They're going to call out. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=533.9s)]
*  So you could be 89% fake streams. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=534.6999999999999s)]
*  But that's what that's saying. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=537.1s)]
*  But over... [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=538.1999999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=538.9s)]
*  It's like that was Spotify's way of saying we know what's going on. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=539.6s)]
*  We're okay with it. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=544.1s)]
*  We're profiting off it. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=544.9s)]
*  It just can't... [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=545.9s)]
*  Of course, because somebody doing a billion streams on your platform is a good look for your platform. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=546.6999999999999s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=551.5s)]
*  Because you're bragging about the amount of streams on your platform. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=552.0s)]
*  Think about where Apple Music loses to Spotify. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=554.3s)]
*  One, they don't show the streams. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=557.4s)]
*  Two, when it came out like last year that there was only one song that has a billion streams on there, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=558.8s)]
*  like it just doesn't look as sexy as Spotify. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=565.1s)]
*  And I feel like as a consumer, oh, nobody's listening to Apple Music. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=567.6999999999999s)]
*  Spotify must be better. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=570.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=571.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=571.8s)]
*  Shit, I'm just going to go with the bigger one. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=572.1s)]
*  So the big streams help the artist and the platform. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=573.7s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=575.9000000000001s)]
*  And the label. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=576.4000000000001s)]
*  So everyone wins. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=577.0s)]
*  That's why no one's going to say anything. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=578.2s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=580.0s)]
*  If you're invested in Spotify, if your money is in Spotify shares, you want to know that it's getting the most streams [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=580.4000000000001s)]
*  and it's beaten Apple by X amount. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=585.9000000000001s)]
*  And the labels are invested. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=587.2s)]
*  I remember when I was... [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=588.5s)]
*  That's the craziest shit. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=589.0s)]
*  I remember when I was with Columbia and Columbia... [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=589.9000000000001s)]
*  There was a point in time where they sold their shares of Spotify, whatever the fuck. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=594.0s)]
*  But everyone on the label, just depending on how many streams you were doing, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=598.9000000000001s)]
*  I got a crazy check from Columbia selling their shares of Spotify. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=604.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=608.3000000000001s)]
*  So why did you get the crazy check? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=608.6s)]
*  Because I was doing a lot of streams on Spotify. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=611.5s)]
*  You get your share of the stream money. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=614.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=615.3000000000001s)]
*  So this is crazy. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=616.2s)]
*  Billy Corgan was on Rogan talking about this. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=617.8000000000001s)]
*  Did you see that episode? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=619.8000000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=620.4s)]
*  Where he was like... [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=621.0s)]
*  And again, I don't know how factual this is, but this is what he said. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=621.8000000000001s)]
*  He's like, the labels took equity pieces in the streaming platforms [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=624.9s)]
*  and then gave the streamer sweetheart deals on the artist's music. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=633.0s)]
*  So basically, we're going to charge you less for the artist's music, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=638.4s)]
*  which means the artist gets less, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=642.0s)]
*  but we are personally going to take equity positions in those companies. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=643.5s)]
*  So give me a little bit of Spotify. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=647.2s)]
*  I'm going to give you this artist's music for a little. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=648.9s)]
*  But when your brand builds because it needs us to build, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=651.7s)]
*  I get that, but you know who doesn't get that? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=654.2s)]
*  The artist. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=656.2s)]
*  The artist. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=656.7s)]
*  Which is crazy. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=657.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=659.0s)]
*  But it's like the artist uses all of that for leverage to go get sponsorships. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=660.6s)]
*  And it's all like fame driven. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=666.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=668.4s)]
*  It's all like the streams might be fake, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=668.9s)]
*  but me being perceived as a massive artist. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=672.0s)]
*  Make money on the road. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=674.8000000000001s)]
*  It's real. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=675.6s)]
*  So now I'm getting this, now I'm getting that, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=676.5s)]
*  and I'm monetizing it with this brand or with this sponsorship, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=678.9s)]
*  whatever it is. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=681.2s)]
*  So it's like, it's all just a fucking finesse and it's all a scam. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=681.8000000000001s)]
*  And there's some artists that are like, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=686.4s)]
*  I'm just going to live off of my deal. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=687.8s)]
*  Right? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=691.0s)]
*  I don't even care if I make enough money to pay back the company or the label, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=691.5s)]
*  whatever it is. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=696.1999999999999s)]
*  They're going to give me my advance. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=696.9s)]
*  That's what I make. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=698.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=699.4s)]
*  Right? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=699.9s)]
*  Well, and it's so funny when artists are like, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=700.4s)]
*  I haven't seen a check since I got signed. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=703.0999999999999s)]
*  It's like, because you're not recouped. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=704.9s)]
*  Because you didn't make any money. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=705.9s)]
*  What are you so confused about? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=707.3s)]
*  It's like you didn't make the money back. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=709.0999999999999s)]
*  Is it because the artists don't know? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=710.5999999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=712.5999999999999s)]
*  I think, I don't think any of the artists know that their streams are being faked. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=713.3s)]
*  Wow. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=717.7s)]
*  No, but that's, and here's the thing. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=718.4000000000001s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=720.4000000000001s)]
*  That's heartbreaking. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=721.0s)]
*  No. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=722.0s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=722.7s)]
*  That's why, first of all, I encourage every artist, audit your label. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=723.6s)]
*  Make sure there's an audit clause, like I'm auditing, you know, who I was with. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=727.8000000000001s)]
*  And there's a lot of money being found. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=732.4000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=734.4000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=734.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, because the reality is like you don't know. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=735.2s)]
*  There's a lot of things that are just hidden in those statements and the marketing expenses. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=737.7s)]
*  And the reason why, like, it's the, like, if you're assigned to a major label, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=741.7s)]
*  right, it's so easy to just deny everything because there's a buffer. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=746.9s)]
*  There's a label. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=753.9s)]
*  The label's the middleman between the fake streams and you. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=754.6s)]
*  So if it comes out that so-and-so is faking their streams, you can just play dumb. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=757.5s)]
*  Be like, I had no idea. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=761.1s)]
*  The label must have did it. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=762.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=763.1999999999999s)]
*  I didn't know what the label was spending their money on. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=763.5s)]
*  And when I have a hit song that has a billion streams, I'm not going to go, are we sure it's a billion? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=765.4s)]
*  This is not me, like, speculating, right? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=769.5s)]
*  This is me talking to, like, top five most streamed artists in the world and them talking to CEOs and CEOs admitting. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=772.2s)]
*  Poof. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=780.3000000000001s)]
*  And me on the phone with, like, managers of massive artists and on the phone with the dude who fakes the stream and them saying, like, what's going on? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=781.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=788.3000000000001s)]
*  Dude, you know what I just said? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=788.7s)]
*  So this is not, it's not like a, I'm not sitting here like. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=789.4s)]
*  This is not conspiratorial. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=791.6s)]
*  This is how we're. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=792.2s)]
*  I really think people are faking. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=793.1s)]
*  And, like, once you know, it's really easy to tell which songs are being faked. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=794.8000000000001s)]
*  Who's the most faked? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=798.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=799.4s)]
*  No, I can't say that. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=800.2s)]
*  Come on. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=801.7s)]
*  Listen, I'm not going to. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=803.2s)]
*  We were talking on Brilliant Idiots and Charlamagne said it was a Drake song that came out. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=804.7s)]
*  It was a Drake and SZA song. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=809.4000000000001s)]
*  SZA, yeah. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=811.4000000000001s)]
*  And he was like, it went number one one week. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=812.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=814.5s)]
*  And then next week it just fell off. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=814.8000000000001s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=816.9000000000001s)]
*  And he was like, listen, those are the types of things where you go, are these songs being pumped up by the label? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=817.6s)]
*  Because I think Doja Cat's song, Paint the Town Red, had been in that top five for weeks. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=824.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=830.4000000000001s)]
*  That you're not going to keep faking streams for. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=831.0s)]
*  Yes, you are. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=832.9s)]
*  For real? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=833.6s)]
*  I'm not saying that she was doing that. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=834.1s)]
*  But you would fake streams for months? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=835.4s)]
*  I'm just saying, like, this is the thing. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=837.0s)]
*  Think of the perception. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=838.8s)]
*  You're getting real. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=839.6s)]
*  Like, it has to be a song. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=840.6999999999999s)]
*  But there's going to be diminishing returns if you keep having to spend a hundred grand every month, no? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=842.4s)]
*  Well, it's not a hundred grand every month. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=846.1999999999999s)]
*  Because it's really just spending enough money to hack the algorithm. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=849.0s)]
*  So 6ix9ine was right. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=853.4s)]
*  Is that what you're trying to say? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=854.4s)]
*  What was he saying? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=855.4s)]
*  Depends on what he said. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=856.1s)]
*  Right about what. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=859.1s)]
*  Fair enough. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=859.8s)]
*  Now, he said something about they took his number one by buying streams for some artists. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=861.9s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, like, the reality is they're not going to do it. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=866.4s)]
*  And it doesn't make sense to do it with something that's not already a moving train. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=870.9s)]
*  Got it. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=874.9s)]
*  When it's already a moving train, the public won't know the difference. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=875.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=879.4s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=879.9s)]
*  Like, if it's a song that genuinely has half a billion streams, if we juice it and now it has 900 million, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=880.6s)]
*  like I said, you're not going to sit there and be like, no, I don't believe it has 900 million, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=887.7s)]
*  because it's massive organically. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=891.7s)]
*  So Donda and what was it, Certified Loverboy, when we were all really fixated on who was going to be number one. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=893.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=899.2s)]
*  Whoever was number one, theoretically, they could have just paid and be like. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=899.7s)]
*  For sure. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=902.7s)]
*  For sure. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=903.2s)]
*  And it almost makes me sorry. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=904.2s)]
*  But it's like the labels are looking, it's a business. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=905.2s)]
*  They're looking at it like we're protecting our investment. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=908.7s)]
*  Of course. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=911.7s)]
*  One. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=912.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=912.7s)]
*  And we're trying to obtain as much of the market share as possible. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=913.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=917.7s)]
*  And they also know, this is just like a psychology thing. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=918.2s)]
*  It's like fake commotion ends up creating real commotion. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=921.2s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=925.2s)]
*  Like, if I'm just over here making a spectacle and it's a fake spectacle, the fake spectacle attracts real eyes. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=926.7s)]
*  And now the real eyes are over here like, what is that spectacle? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=933.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=936.2s)]
*  And now I have real people tuned in off of fake commotion. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=936.7s)]
*  So here's a question because we all see academics that post about who sells what in the first week or whatever. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=939.7s)]
*  I think it was French Montana had like a really bad first week. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=944.7s)]
*  Is that French Montana standing on his own honor and being like, I refuse to play into this, buy any streams? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=947.7s)]
*  Or do you think the label might be like, I'm assuming it's with a label, would be like, yeah, we're kind of done with you. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=952.7s)]
*  And you're going to have an embarrassingly low number because it's the real number, whereas everybody else is getting inflated. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=957.7s)]
*  But your shit is going to sit low. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=963.2s)]
*  I don't know what his situation, well, I know, like, French is my guy. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=965.2s)]
*  And actually like helped him get the deal that he has. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=968.2s)]
*  I think French is great. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=970.7s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=971.7s)]
*  But it's like, yeah, either, you know, sometimes maybe it's not just so transparent where they're like, hey, do you want to fake your streams or not? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=972.7s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=979.7s)]
*  Or it's like, it's not a moving train. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=980.7s)]
*  So we're not going to push the button on it because it's not a moving train. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=984.2s)]
*  Yeah, if the album came out with some heat, then they could put the songs on it. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=987.2s)]
*  Put it like this, full transparency. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=990.7s)]
*  Now, I also know, and I've said this in interviews before, like, this is the thing I'm like worried about. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=992.2s)]
*  Is like me pointing the finger and calling shit out. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=997.2s)]
*  All that's going to happen is people are like, no, no, no, you're faking your stream. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1000.2s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1005.2s)]
*  You know so much. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1006.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1007.2s)]
*  Like, how do you know? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1008.2s)]
*  And you were on the phone, nah, and you know what? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1009.2s)]
*  Who even listens to Russ? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1011.2s)]
*  You're faking your stream. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1012.2s)]
*  But- [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1013.2s)]
*  Now, you got people coming out to shows. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1014.2s)]
*  I think that's the difference maker right there. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1015.2s)]
*  Real bodies. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1017.2s)]
*  But I will say this before transparency. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1018.2s)]
*  Like, this is the truth. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1020.2s)]
*  315 is a song I have that I put out, I don't know, two years ago, three years ago. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1023.7s)]
*  And right now it's doing, I don't know, 500,000 streams a day on Spotify. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1027.7s)]
*  There was a time where it was doing 800,000 and 900,000. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1032.7s)]
*  Right? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1035.7s)]
*  And the threshold to go into today's top hits is like they want to see you getting like 1.1. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1036.7s)]
*  Right? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1041.7s)]
*  And that's like once you're in today's top hits, see you. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1042.7s)]
*  Right? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1045.7s)]
*  So we got on the phone, because I was like, Milan, I hit my manager, I was like, Milan, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1046.7s)]
*  I hit this guy, like, because I've like, low key, I'm like planning like a fucking Vice [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1052.2s)]
*  documentary. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1056.2s)]
*  I'm like, no shit. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1057.2s)]
*  I'm like, Milan, hit this guy, like, what is the like process? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1058.2s)]
*  But it's like, so he talks to him and he's like, look, you know- [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1063.2s)]
*  You got to fake his voice. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1070.2s)]
*  This is the perfect song to do it because it's crushing organically. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1071.2s)]
*  Nobody's going to know the difference between 200,000 streams. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1076.2s)]
*  315 organically was the number, before TikTok and Billboard did the thing where there was [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1079.7s)]
*  a Billboard chart for TikTok songs, 315 was the number one song on TikTok in the world. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1082.7s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1087.7s)]
*  Organically. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1089.7s)]
*  So once again, if I was to boost that, what is anyone going to say? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1090.7s)]
*  No, I hear it everywhere on TikTok, so kind of checks out, makes sense. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1094.7s)]
*  And we talked to the dude, or Milan talked to him, and told us, you know, it's like an [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1098.7s)]
*  8 to 12 week campaign. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1103.7s)]
*  You spend 35, 40 grand and like, that's it. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1104.7s)]
*  Then it's out of here. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1109.2s)]
*  And now guess what? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1110.2s)]
*  Now it goes from, once again, it goes from 800,000 organic streams a day to now maybe [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1111.2s)]
*  it is doing that 1.2 million threshold. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1116.2s)]
*  And now Spotify puts it in today's top hits. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1118.2s)]
*  And now it's at 2 million. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1121.2s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1123.2s)]
*  And now radio's like, wait, this is a smash. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1124.2s)]
*  It's a multiplier. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1127.2s)]
*  And so all of a sudden, that extra 400,000 streams that are fake get a whole bunch of [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1128.2s)]
*  real ears. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1133.2s)]
*  But I just could not live with myself if I did it because the reason why, like, and I'm [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1134.2s)]
*  going to be honest, it's so tempting. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1138.2s)]
*  Right? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1139.7s)]
*  I've even tweeted about it before where it's like, wait a second. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1140.7s)]
*  If everyone's on steroids, am I an idiot? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1143.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's the baseball shit. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1147.7s)]
*  Am I an idiot? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1149.7s)]
*  Right? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1150.7s)]
*  Like, am I being naive and almost childish where it's like, I'm sitting here still trying [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1151.7s)]
*  to like play the game the right way, and everyone else is like, dog, what are you doing? [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1155.7s)]
*  Like, you know, we're all doing this, right? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1160.7s)]
*  And so I start, you know, I oscillate with like yes and no every day, but I just have [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1163.2s)]
*  faith, and I know that that house is going to come crumbling down, and I don't want to [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1169.2s)]
*  be in it when it does. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1173.2s)]
*  Because guess what it'll do? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1174.7s)]
*  It won't just be, oh, Russ, you fake the streams on 315. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1175.7s)]
*  It'll send the whole catalog into question. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1180.6000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1183.2s)]
*  Especially because- [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1184.2s)]
*  And that would fucking ruin me. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1185.2s)]
*  Especially because you're independent. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1187.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1188.2s)]
*  If you're not independent, if you're already part of the label system- [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1189.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1192.2s)]
*  Even if you put it all into question, they wouldn't be incentivized to tear them down. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1193.2s)]
*  But to you- [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1196.7s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1197.7s)]
*  There are people, I'm sure, that are part of the industry that have heard all the shit [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1198.7s)]
*  that you said and then seen your success without them, and they're like- [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1200.7s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1202.7s)]
*  They're waiting for me to fake my- [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1203.7s)]
*  100%. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1204.7s)]
*  The second if I did it, second I did it, it would be Russ is faking his streams. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1205.7s)]
*  And let this be a lesson to all other independent artists. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1210.7s)]
*  Right, because guess what that narrative is? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1212.7s)]
*  Now the narrative would be, see, you can't get real success- [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1213.7s)]
*  Without us. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1217.7s)]
*  Independent unless you fake your stream. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1218.7s)]
*  Yep. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1219.7s)]
*  You gotta be with the major. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1220.7s)]
*  So I just feel I owe it not just to myself but to the whole independent community to [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1222.2s)]
*  do it the real way. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1228.2s)]
*  And look, if that means that I have a ceiling here, then so be it. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1230.2s)]
*  But at least this is real. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1234.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1235.2s)]
*  Why are you all doing billions of streams and the tickets don't match? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1236.2s)]
*  Because that is, they explain that. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1240.2s)]
*  Because I'll see certain guys that I think are these huge artists. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1242.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1246.2s)]
*  Or girls too, and it's like they can do the festival shows, and people kind of know their [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1247.2s)]
*  songs at the festival shows. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1251.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1252.2s)]
*  But the festival is bringing in the people. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1253.2s)]
*  It's a soft ticket, yeah. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1254.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1255.7s)]
*  You know, who is, so how do you explain the discrepancy? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1256.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1260.7s)]
*  I mean, honestly, some of it I will say, like devil's advocate, I do think certain music [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1261.7s)]
*  is geared towards a certain environment. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1266.7s)]
*  Certain music is club music. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1269.7s)]
*  You're not going to an arena to hear club music. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1270.7s)]
*  Rap sucks live, let's just be honest. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1273.7s)]
*  Nah, not all the time. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1275.7s)]
*  It's not all the time. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1276.7s)]
*  It's awful sometimes. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1277.7s)]
*  It's awful sometimes. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1279.2s)]
*  That is the worst music live, it's so bad it's unbelievable. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1280.2s)]
*  Wait, give me an example of rap. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1284.2s)]
*  But Travis, I literally asked him afterwards, I was like, yo, usually rap sucks live, like [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1287.2s)]
*  why didn't this suck? [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1292.2s)]
*  And he goes, he goes, I make music for the live show. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1293.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1297.2s)]
*  I'm specifically putting together these songs for this experience. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1298.2s)]
*  That's a great point, counterpoint, you also saw 50 Cent the night before, and that was [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1301.2s)]
*  also incredible. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1304.2s)]
*  I'm sure 50 was live. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1305.2s)]
*  Your theory is falling apart pretty quickly. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1306.2s)]
*  50 was incredible. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1308.2s)]
*  I'm sure. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1309.2s)]
*  But we didn't see 50 in arena, but 50 in arena would be incredible. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1310.2s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1312.2s)]
*  Okay, there's no question. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1313.2s)]
*  What I'm trying to say is, I can listen to a random person sing karaoke, and if their [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1314.2s)]
*  voice is amazing, it shuts it down. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1318.7s)]
*  Like, you've seen those videos where people are singing a song in Italian in a restaurant, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1320.7s)]
*  like they just come in and start singing, the whole restaurant starts singing. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1324.7s)]
*  Walk in and try to rap in a restaurant, and see your ass get arrested immediately. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1327.7s)]
*  If it's great, it'll, I think- [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1331.7s)]
*  Walk into a restaurant and start singing Lose Yourself. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1333.7s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here, y'all. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1336.7s)]
*  I got a chicken sandwich on the way out. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1338.2s)]
*  I don't want to hear that shit. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1340.2s)]
*  Lose Yourself by recall. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1341.2s)]
*  Be honest. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1342.2s)]
*  I think generally, depending on the restaurant. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1343.2s)]
*  But no, but to that point- [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1346.2s)]
*  What are you trying to say? [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1347.2s)]
*  To that point, it's like, it depends on the music the environment was made for. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1348.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1352.2s)]
*  So if it's car, cruise, and music where you're by yourself chilling, maybe you don't want [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1353.2s)]
*  to hear that in front of 18,000 people. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1356.2s)]
*  Right, and maybe it's like, I don't want to hear two hours straight of it. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1357.7s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1362.2s)]
*  I do think it's some of that, but also, yeah, it's the faking the streams. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1363.2s)]
*  It's, you know. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1366.7s)]
*  Guys, Life Tour, Charlotte. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1367.7s)]

*  Yo, San Jose, thank you guys so much. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1396.2s)]
*  That was crazy. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1398.7s)]
*  They had just expanded the club. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1399.7s)]
*  We still sold it out. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1401.2s)]
*  And we had more people coming after. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1402.7s)]
*  We filled up every standby ticket we could possibly fill. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1404.2s)]
*  Other people still didn't get in. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1406.2s)]
*  That was amazing. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1407.7s)]
*  One of the best weekends of my comedy life. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1408.7s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1410.2s)]
*  Also, February 23rd and 24th, Oklahoma City. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1411.2s)]
*  We're not doing the 22nd anymore. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1414.2s)]
*  I have to film a little something. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1415.7s)]
*  You will see what it is soon. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1416.7s)]
*  But Oklahoma City, February 23rd and 24th. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1418.2s)]
*  And March 1st and 2nd, Greensboro, North Carolina. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1420.7s)]
*  I'm excited to be in a place that might not be so cold in March. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1423.2s)]
*  So hurry up and buy your fucking tickets to that. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1425.7s)]
*  And March 8th and 9th, Stanford, Connecticut. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1427.7s)]
*  April 11th through 13th, Tempe. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1429.7s)]
*  And April 18th through 20th, Denver, Colorado. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1432.2s)]
*  We're doing another 420 show at ComedyWorks. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1434.2s)]
*  This time at the bigger location. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1436.7s)]
*  Let's see what happens. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1438.2s)]
*  Get those tickets and more at AkashSingh.com. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1439.2s)]
*  Now let's get back to the show. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1442.2s)]
*  Can you break down independent? [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1443.7s)]
*  I feel artists throw out... [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1445.2s)]
*  What is independent? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1446.7s)]
*  Because some people say distro, but they're independent. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1448.7s)]
*  I know. I have... yeah. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1451.2s)]
*  It's kind of gotten... [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1452.7s)]
*  Like you even said you were signed, but then you say you're independent. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1454.2s)]
*  What is that? [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1457.2s)]
*  Yeah, I'll just be fully transparent even though I've posted when I literally partnered. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1458.2s)]
*  But I partnered with Columbia in 2016. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1461.7s)]
*  They say that too a lot. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1464.7s)]
*  They don't say I'm not signed, I'm partnered. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1466.2s)]
*  Right, right. No, but I partnered because they didn't own my masters. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1467.7s)]
*  And the big piece was my back catalog that was on TuneCore. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1470.7s)]
*  They didn't touch. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1474.7s)]
*  So I had hundreds of songs. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1475.7s)]
*  TuneCore, can you tell us casuals what TuneCore is? [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1477.7s)]
*  First breakdown. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1480.2s)]
*  Yeah, so TuneCore, very quick, is just... [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1482.2s)]
*  It's a digital distribution service. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1485.2s)]
*  You pay $50 a year. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1488.2s)]
*  You put up as much music as you want. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1490.2s)]
*  You keep 100% of the profits. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1492.2s)]
*  Right? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1493.7s)]
*  So I had all this music up on TuneCore. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1494.7s)]
*  And I created all this leverage because shit was going crazy. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1497.2s)]
*  I was already touring. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1499.7s)]
*  And I partnered with Columbia because at that time in 2016, it was a way different landscape. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1501.2s)]
*  Apple Music didn't even come out until 2015. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1505.7s)]
*  I remember I had like what they want was in Rap Caviar back when Tuma Basa was running Rap Caviar. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1507.7s)]
*  And I didn't even know what the fuck Rap Caviar was. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1513.7s)]
*  Like that's how new everything was. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1515.7s)]
*  So I signed because I was looking around the game and I was like I want to be a massive artist. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1518.7s)]
*  I want to be on radio. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1524.7s)]
*  And I'm listening to everyone on radio. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1526.7s)]
*  I'm like they're all signed. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1527.7s)]
*  So let me level the playing field. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1528.7s)]
*  That was the intention, right? [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1529.7s)]
*  So I partnered but I kept my back catalog. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1532.2s)]
*  I kept 100% ownership. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1534.2s)]
*  And everything I did with Columbia was y'all get 50, I get 50. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1536.2s)]
*  Simple. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1540.2s)]
*  And you hit the full master. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1541.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1542.2s)]
*  So it's like that feels fair to me. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1543.2s)]
*  Y'all putting up money. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1545.2s)]
*  Like whatever. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1546.2s)]
*  Let's rock out. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1547.2s)]
*  And then in 2020, I believe, went just back fully indie. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1548.2s)]
*  Done with the deal. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1553.2s)]
*  Why didn't it work out? [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1554.2s)]
*  Why were you not? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1556.2s)]
*  It just got to the point where I realized the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1557.2s)]
*  And they couldn't do anything for me that I couldn't do for myself. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1560.7s)]
*  So that's my question. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1563.7s)]
*  Like you gave them 50%, which means you need to essentially double your profits that you [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1564.7s)]
*  could do on your own for it to be break even. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1568.7s)]
*  Did you more than double being with them? [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1571.7s)]
*  Oh, so there was value in being with them. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1573.7s)]
*  Well, like I said, it was a moving train. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1576.7s)]
*  I was going to make money anyway. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1578.7s)]
*  Got it. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1580.7s)]
*  So also, yeah, we're not counting how much you would have made off your next album with [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1581.7s)]
*  all the hype and everything. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1583.7s)]
*  So you didn't think that they offered enough value to continue? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1584.7s)]
*  I think at a certain point, once the game sort of began to progress and once I started [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1588.2s)]
*  to see the big thing for me was them getting told no. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1592.2s)]
*  That was big. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1596.2s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1597.2s)]
*  Meaning I, which I know a lot of up and coming artists think like this, oh, well, you get [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1598.2s)]
*  with the label and then you just get told yes to being on that playlist and yes to being [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1603.2s)]
*  on radio. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1607.2s)]
*  Oh, so they're getting told no and you're like, fuck them up with you? [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1608.2s)]
*  I'm like, so then you get with the label. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1610.2s)]
*  I get told no by myself. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1611.2s)]
*  Literally, that was the exact thought. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1612.2s)]
*  And I told him, I said, I get told no by myself. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1614.2s)]
*  So those boardroom meetings, some of those people sitting around the table, one of them [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1617.7s)]
*  is the Spotify and Apple rep. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1622.7s)]
*  You got to make him get on the table. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1624.7s)]
*  It's just them calling, realistically, like, y'all should be on the table. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1626.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1630.7s)]
*  You're trying to sell me. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1631.7s)]
*  Get him to pitch you, I'm going to get you on Rap Cat and Be Our Star. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1632.7s)]
*  Once you realize and once I saw that, all right, it's just a human being calling Spotify [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1635.7s)]
*  or Apple like, hey, of our 70 releases we have this Friday, you guys should really consider [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1641.2s)]
*  us for these playlists and they can get told no. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1646.7s)]
*  And I was like, well, wait a second. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1650.2s)]
*  I can also get told no and keep 100%. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1652.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1655.2s)]
*  You know, so and when you talk to these people at the playlist, who do you think they would [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1656.2s)]
*  rather talk to? [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1661.2s)]
*  The dude at the label or the artist? [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1663.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1665.2s)]
*  They're all in the music business to be cool with the artist. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1666.2s)]
*  Yeah, they don't want to talk to the squares. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1669.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1671.2s)]
*  And who's going to sell it better? [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1672.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1673.2s)]
*  The person at the label who's pitching your song to the playlist right after he pitches [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1674.7s)]
*  yours, he's pitching seven others. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1680.2s)]
*  And it's harder to tell you no than it is to tell the label though. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1682.2s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1685.2s)]
*  Like you're on the phone fighting for your shit. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1686.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1687.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1688.2s)]
*  They're not going to be like, nah. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1689.2s)]
*  No, but they have no problem telling this dude no. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1690.2s)]
*  You know? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1692.2s)]
*  Also the ego stroke that they get when the artist themself is calling them. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1693.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's an element too. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1696.2s)]
*  That's going to be on the playlist. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1697.2s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1698.2s)]
*  I would rather be in direct communication with who is responsible for maybe getting [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1699.2s)]
*  my music heard by more people. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1705.2s)]
*  But yeah, once I realize like, wait a second, y'all get told no, it's not a guarantee, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1707.2s)]
*  play listing, radio, none of that's a guarantee with y'all. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1712.2s)]
*  All you can guarantee is a big bag of money up front, which is the most attractive part [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1715.2s)]
*  to a lot of people. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1720.2s)]
*  But. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1721.2s)]
*  Right? [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1722.2s)]
*  But that's your money they're giving you. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1723.2s)]
*  Son, is that? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1724.2s)]
*  And it comes with a crazy interest rate. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1725.2s)]
*  And it's like. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1727.2s)]
*  That's the thing a lot of people don't realize. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1728.2s)]
*  They're giving you, it's a loan with a shitty rate. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1731.2s)]
*  But it's not even a loan because a loan wouldn't be taxed. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1734.2s)]
*  If you took a loan from a bank, there's no tax on it. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1738.2s)]
*  It's not necessarily income. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1743.2s)]
*  It's a crazy situation. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1744.2s)]
*  Now what I'll say. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1745.2s)]
*  The government's taking half immediately, but you got to pay back the full thing. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1746.2s)]
*  I never understood that Jay-Z. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1750.2s)]
*  You remember that Jay-Z line, y'all still taking advances, huh? [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1751.2s)]
*  I was like, what's wrong with advances? [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1754.2s)]
*  That's the dumbest shit ever. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1755.2s)]
*  So let's just do quick math. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1758.2s)]
*  Let's say they front you five million dollars. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1759.2s)]
*  You take that five million, government immediately comes and takes two and a half. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1761.2s)]
*  But you still owe five. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1765.2s)]
*  No. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1766.2s)]
*  Well, it depends what your deal is. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1767.2s)]
*  So what you do is you get the five. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1768.2s)]
*  Because you don't want to give as much money to the government, you pay commissions on [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1771.2s)]
*  the five first. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1775.2s)]
*  Of course, you can do it right off your commission. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1776.2s)]
*  But most people have manager on 20, lawyer on five, business manager on five. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1778.2s)]
*  So that's 30. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1783.2s)]
*  So off top, what is that? [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1784.2s)]
*  That's 1.5 million. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1786.2s)]
*  So now you're at 3.5. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1787.2s)]
*  Now you cut the 3.5 in half. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1788.2s)]
*  You're at 1.75. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1789.2s)]
*  1.75. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1790.2s)]
*  So you got five. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1791.2s)]
*  That's really what five is. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1792.2s)]
*  And that's before you spend anything. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1793.2s)]
*  And you got to spend that on production. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1794.2s)]
*  You got to send that on beats. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1795.2s)]
*  Yeah, because that's your recording advance. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1796.2s)]
*  So just think about that. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1797.2s)]
*  That's to me handcuffs. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1798.2s)]
*  Now there is a way to kind of, because I've spoken to certain companies about deals, right? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1799.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1800.2s)]
*  And I'm like, so what's the advantage of this? [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1801.2s)]
*  It seems like you just give me the money. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1802.2s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going to give you the money. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1803.2s)]
*  I'm going to give you the money. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1804.2s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going to give you the money. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1806.2s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going to give you the money. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1807.2s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going to give you the money. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1808.2s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going to give you the money. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1809.2s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going to give you the money. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1810.2s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going to give you the money. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1811.2s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going to give you the money. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1812.2s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going to give you the money. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1813.2s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going to give you the money. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1814.2s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going to give you the money. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1815.2s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going to give you the money. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1816.2s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going to give you the money. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1817.2s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going to give you the money. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1818.2s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going to give you the money. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1819.2s)]
*  I don't know how to do that. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1821.2s)]
*  I genuinely don't. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1822.2s)]
*  And I just tell them straight up. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1823.2s)]
*  So it's like, it seems to me what this does is it's kind of like shackles me to you. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1824.2s)]
*  And I guess I get some money upfront, but that money isn't my money. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1828.2s)]
*  I have to make that money anyway. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1831.76s)]
*  So, but what I did ask is what if we did a loan instead of an advance? [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1834.2s)]
*  Because a loan is technically not taxable with income tax. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1839.56s)]
*  You only get taxed based on what you make back against that loan. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1843.6000000000001s)]
*  So you can, you know what I mean? [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1847.4s)]
*  There are certain ways around it, but it is kind of fucked up how. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1849.6000000000001s)]
*  It is fucked up. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1852.1000000000001s)]
*  Because it's a lot of people also think, well, if they give me five, you know, that incentivizes [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1853.1000000000001s)]
*  them to get their money back. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1859.24s)]
*  It's no, the whole label is cross collateralized. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1861.24s)]
*  Meaning, guess what? [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1863.8000000000002s)]
*  If I give you five and I give you five and I give you five and I give you five and these [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1866.7s)]
*  three flop and you make 50 mil back. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1871.6000000000001s)]
*  I don't care that these three come because and nor am I even going to pay attention to [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1873.72s)]
*  these. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1877.2s)]
*  You're the one keeping the lights on. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1879.0s)]
*  It's the venture capitalists that like. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1881.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1882.4s)]
*  We only need one of these investments to work out. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1883.4s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1885.4s)]
*  Now what's the distribution deal? [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1886.4s)]
*  Distribution deal is more so there's no ownership of masters. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1888.4s)]
*  The splits are way more favorable. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1892.0s)]
*  So like you go to Empire, maybe you get an 80-20, which is just like, it's a profit split. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1893.4s)]
*  Like there's no, they don't own the masters, right? [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1898.6000000000001s)]
*  And they usually offer label services. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1902.2s)]
*  So that's where it's like back to the very original, like what is independent? [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1904.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there's different variations because independent to some people is well, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1907.8s)]
*  I'm just not with a major label. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1912.5s)]
*  It's like, all right, so you're not with a major label, but you're with that label who [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1913.8s)]
*  has major label services and you got an advance and they do label services. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1918.36s)]
*  It's like, I guess, you know, I guess. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1923.08s)]
*  Yeah, that like in a sense, if that is your definition of independent, I'm just not with [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1926.6s)]
*  a major, then yeah, you're independent. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1930.48s)]
*  But for me for a while, you know, before Columbia, I was independent in the sense that [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1932.72s)]
*  I didn't depend on anyone to do anything for me. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1939.04s)]
*  And even post Columbia, that's what it was up until the Santiago album where, you know, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1943.16s)]
*  I've been putting music out, similar with TuneCore is Vidia, right? [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1948.44s)]
*  Vidia is another like digital distribution, right? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1951.84s)]
*  I pay $50 a year because I have a great relationship with CEO, pay $50 a year, put out as much [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1955.24s)]
*  music as I want, same shit as TuneCore. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1960.04s)]
*  Will they collect the money on your behalf? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1961.8s)]
*  So they recognize every time it's been played on radio, streamed? [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1964.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's the same thing as TuneCore. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1967.0s)]
*  Everything is like, yeah, monitored and registered and collected. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1968.8s)]
*  So there's an RSS feed or something that goes back to those? [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1971.2s)]
*  Yeah, there's a back end. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1973.36s)]
*  There's a portal and you log in and you can see what everything's doing and how much money [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1974.36s)]
*  you withdraw and send it to your bank account, right? [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1977.36s)]
*  Every Friday. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1979.76s)]
*  So in Korea, it was played on this time a hundred times. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1980.76s)]
*  They owe you $10,000 from that. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1981.76s)]
*  That all comes back. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1983.8s)]
*  And I get paid every Friday. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1984.8s)]
*  It's been like that since 2011. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1985.8s)]
*  Gotcha. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1986.8s)]
*  So instead of that going to the label and then the label distributes it to you, TuneCore can [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1987.8s)]
*  just do it so it cuts them out of the way. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1991.16s)]
*  And Artists on Major Labels is a semiannual check if you're recouped. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1992.76s)]
*  So if you're recouped, you're getting paid twice a year. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1996.4s)]
*  Twice. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=1999.52s)]
*  So that's if you're recouped. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2000.52s)]
*  You get paid in March, April and you get paid in fucking September, October. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2002.0400000000002s)]
*  You know it's fucking hilarious, which I make this joke with my team all the time, just [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2006.3200000000002s)]
*  because of when I left the deal and kind of how it works out. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2010.72s)]
*  My birthday is September 26th. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2014.6000000000001s)]
*  And so every year, ever since I left Columbia, they send me a check for a meal on my birthday [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2016.72s)]
*  because that's when the semiannual date falls. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2022.52s)]
*  So I always know that on my birthday, they have to get me. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2027.24s)]
*  Yo, that's sick. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2030.3600000000001s)]
*  That's actually a nice little birthday present. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2031.3600000000001s)]
*  It is. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2033.3600000000001s)]
*  Sick. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2034.3600000000001s)]
*  I know. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2035.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm always like, I know they're fucking throwing up right in this shit. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2036.3600000000001s)]
*  So the cross-collateralized thing is really interesting also because I imagine that that's [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2038.0s)]
*  the idea around the 360 deal, which is it's really just more protection from them. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2045.0800000000002s)]
*  Of course. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2049.76s)]
*  So it's like, I think we don't need your music to sell. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2050.76s)]
*  We'll get it on the merch. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2052.44s)]
*  So we gave you that five million. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2053.52s)]
*  We need five million back. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2054.6s)]
*  You only have 1.75 after paying commissions and taxes or whatever. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2055.6800000000003s)]
*  So even if you paid us that back, we still need the other 3.25. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2059.4s)]
*  So if your album does nothing but we throw you in these, you know, what's it called shows, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2064.2400000000002s)]
*  we send you around the world, we're getting that 3.75 back off of these other things. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2068.04s)]
*  I think our perception on 360 was they just want a little piece of everything. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2073.7599999999998s)]
*  It's like, no, they don't even know if you're going to make money. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2077.3599999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2079.24s)]
*  But if you do, that's like the interesting thing, right? [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2080.24s)]
*  Is like this whole notion. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2083.08s)]
*  This might come off crazy, but it's the reality. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2085.7599999999998s)]
*  It's like, oh, it's a bad deal. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2087.3599999999997s)]
*  For who? [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2089.48s)]
*  For who? [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2090.48s)]
*  For the artist. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2091.48s)]
*  The label's signing good deals. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2092.48s)]
*  Oh, they're signing good deals. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2093.48s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2094.48s)]
*  And that's what people are not, artists need to go into these meetings understanding [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2095.48s)]
*  it's business. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2104.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2105.48s)]
*  They are not about to sign a bad deal. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2106.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2108.48s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2109.48s)]
*  Which is why you need leverage to make them sign a deal that they normally wouldn't want [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2110.48s)]
*  to sign, but they don't want to lose out on your potential. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2114.8799999999997s)]
*  It is funny how they get salty when they're on the wrong end of the deal, though. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2117.8399999999997s)]
*  Of course. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2121.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2122.12s)]
*  Of course. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2123.12s)]
*  I feel like we should understand it's business and they should understand it's business. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2124.12s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2126.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2127.12s)]
*  Can you talk about the dollars and cents when it comes to streams when you're independent [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2128.12s)]
*  and with a label? [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2131.3599999999997s)]
*  When you get a million streams independent or a million streams with a label, how much [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2132.36s)]
*  money does the artist get? [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2135.04s)]
*  A million streams independent is like on Spotify, four grand, give or take. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2136.04s)]
*  If you're independent? [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2141.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2142.1200000000003s)]
*  If you own 100% of the song. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2143.1200000000003s)]
*  Got it. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2144.1200000000003s)]
*  And then if you're with a label, how much do you get? [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2145.1200000000003s)]
*  You may not see anything. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2146.36s)]
*  Let's say you're already recouped. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2148.04s)]
*  How much is a million streams? [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2149.44s)]
*  It depends on what your split is with the label. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2150.6800000000003s)]
*  It's the same four grand. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2152.1600000000003s)]
*  It's the same four grand. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2153.1600000000003s)]
*  It's $50,000, $50,000. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2154.1600000000003s)]
*  It's just like... [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2155.1600000000003s)]
*  But I thought Spotify has deals with record labels where it's like they get bigger. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2156.1600000000003s)]
*  Better rates. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2160.48s)]
*  Sometimes it's like tier one rates or tier two rates. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2161.52s)]
*  Yeah, but some of these... [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2164.56s)]
*  That's why you got to be careful which distro you go to because some of these distros don't [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2165.92s)]
*  have the tier one rates that the labels have. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2170.48s)]
*  They might have tier two rates, so they're actually getting less money per stream than [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2173.0s)]
*  a major label. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2176.56s)]
*  But what's the difference between independent and getting... [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2177.56s)]
*  Oh yeah, like Tunecore, yeah. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2178.56s)]
*  Tunecore, Vidya, you're getting what the labels get. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2180.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2183.56s)]
*  You're getting what the labels... [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2184.56s)]
*  You're getting the same rate. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2185.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2186.56s)]
*  You're getting the same... [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2187.56s)]
*  Drake is getting more money per stream than the up and coming artist. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2189.36s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2192.36s)]
*  Because he's bringing more to Spotify. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2194.12s)]
*  He has leverage. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2195.12s)]
*  Yeah, he's more valuable to the streamer. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2196.12s)]
*  Same label. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2197.12s)]
*  Oh yeah, he's going to get more. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2198.12s)]
*  He's got a better deal. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2199.12s)]
*  He's going to get more. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2200.12s)]
*  Yeah, he's going to get more. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2201.12s)]
*  I'm not even mad at that though. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2202.12s)]
*  No, he deserves it. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2203.84s)]
*  Like, once again, people never consider the other side. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2204.84s)]
*  It's like, bro, this is a storefront, right? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2209.28s)]
*  That is allowing you... [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2216.0800000000004s)]
*  Stop with the entitlement. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2219.2000000000003s)]
*  It's allowing you to sell your music in their store. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2220.2000000000003s)]
*  You don't have any leverage to say, this is some bullshit. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2224.88s)]
*  You got this dude who's bringing y'all way more money, getting paid more than me? [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2229.1600000000003s)]
*  It's like, yeah. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2233.2000000000003s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2234.2000000000003s)]
*  They built the platform, they put the money up for R&D. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2235.2000000000003s)]
*  Am I going to put Nike in the storefront or your fucking brand that nobody's ever heard [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2238.2400000000002s)]
*  of? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2240.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2241.92s)]
*  You know Drake's deal? [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2242.92s)]
*  Oh, I don't know Drake's deal. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2243.92s)]
*  I'm sure you have any ideas. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2244.92s)]
*  Right, he was not re-signed to a major... [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2245.92s)]
*  Isn't he doing something? [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2246.92s)]
*  No, I think he did re-sign. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2247.92s)]
*  I think they gave him a crazy bag. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2248.92s)]
*  The Apple one? [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2250.96s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2251.96s)]
*  He re-signed, I think, with Republic and I think he got a disgusting bag, as he should. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2252.96s)]
*  What are the rumors of how disgusting? [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2257.84s)]
*  I know what y'all know is what was online. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2259.96s)]
*  300? [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2261.6800000000003s)]
*  Fucking three, four, who knows? [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2262.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean, they're going to get it back. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2263.6800000000003s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2266.0400000000004s)]
*  And it might be cross-collateralized with his past stuff. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2267.32s)]
*  Oh, it is cross-collateralized. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2269.48s)]
*  It has to be. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2270.48s)]
*  That's how they get the money. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2271.48s)]
*  So you're going to get it back off of the old stuff anyway. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2272.48s)]
*  Well, think about it. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2273.48s)]
*  It's like if you're with the label for five years, right? [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2274.48s)]
*  Five years, five albums, and you've generated 200 million with that label. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2279.8s)]
*  You go into another label, they can't give you 200 up front because you're starting from [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2284.48s)]
*  scratch. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2288.8s)]
*  The label you've already made all this money with, that's your best chance to get the biggest [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2289.8s)]
*  bag because they can just cross-collateralize it. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2294.12s)]
*  Once again, it's the same thing. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2296.3599999999997s)]
*  They protect themselves with your past work. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2297.3599999999997s)]
*  Each album is the investment. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2299.0s)]
*  So guess what? [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2300.52s)]
*  If we own Drake or Nicki or Ariana Grande or Taylor Swift's catalog, even if her next [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2301.56s)]
*  album or next five albums flop, we're making 500 mil off these last steps. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2306.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2311.52s)]
*  Doesn't matter. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2312.52s)]
*  And Drake knows that too. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2313.52s)]
*  So the number's going up with what he asked for. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2314.52s)]
*  He's like, these albums don't even need a hit. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2316.16s)]
*  No, because- [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2318.24s)]
*  These are going to get played for the next 20 years. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2319.24s)]
*  And that's what I'm saying, because it's macro. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2320.24s)]
*  Exactly, yeah. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2321.72s)]
*  In totality. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2322.72s)]
*  It's the whole library. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2323.72s)]
*  And he's like, I'm going to make a lucrative product. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2325.24s)]
*  But doesn't he have enough money, incentive and popularity to go independent after his [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2326.24s)]
*  deal? [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2331.3599999999997s)]
*  True, but he just, I don't know, he just may not want to. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2332.3599999999997s)]
*  Because there is a, there's something to be said that's not right or wrong. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2335.24s)]
*  Not every path is for everyone. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2339.48s)]
*  Some people like, they don't, being independent takes a lot of work, a lot of entrepreneurial [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2340.7999999999997s)]
*  spirit. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2345.52s)]
*  Not saying that he or anyone else doesn't have it, but it's just, some people, they [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2346.52s)]
*  want to show up. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2349.6s)]
*  Yo, some people need a system. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2350.6s)]
*  Yo, send me my big ass bag, make sure all my shit's on radio. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2352.0s)]
*  I'll talk to y'all when I talk to y'all. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2356.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2357.56s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2358.56s)]
*  Which, there's nothing wrong with that. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2359.56s)]
*  I get that. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2360.56s)]
*  Me, I'm just like, I'm just really, really obnoxiously hands-on. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2361.56s)]
*  I like being hands-on. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2365.8399999999997s)]
*  I like every aspect of my career. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2367.2s)]

*  There's certain comics that I'll talk to, right? [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2375.0s)]
*  And I'll explain, like, if I'm just trying to give them some game, I'll just explain [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2376.7599999999998s)]
*  what they need to do in order to achieve what they want. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2380.6s)]
*  And I'll really kind of spell it out. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2385.24s)]
*  And then I'll develop different models for them. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2388.36s)]
*  I'll be like, listen, if you don't want to learn how to edit, if you want to learn how [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2391.2s)]
*  to subtitle, if you don't want to bring a camera, like, I bring a camera bag to every [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2394.08s)]
*  show by myself, put it up in the back of the fucking room, move some tables out of the [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2397.7999999999997s)]
*  way, it gets knocked over halfway through the set. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2402.7599999999998s)]
*  I got to ask some security guard to stand by it, like, figure out how to do audio. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2405.04s)]
*  It's a lot. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2409.7599999999998s)]
*  And sometimes I can tell they don't want to do all that. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2411.48s)]
*  Sure. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2413.52s)]
*  So I'm like, you know what? [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2414.52s)]
*  You might need a partner with somebody who's going to do all that. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2415.52s)]
*  Or you need to bring somebody up. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2418.52s)]
*  In that case, that's what I did with Al, put somebody, I was like, listen, I want you to [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2420.72s)]
*  handle this aspect of the biz. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2424.4399999999996s)]
*  And there's certain people that they just don't know how to do it. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2427.3599999999997s)]
*  They're not industrious. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2429.56s)]
*  This is not one of their passions. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2430.56s)]
*  And it might be better for them to lose that 10% or that 20%. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2432.7599999999998s)]
*  Put your energy towards something else. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2438.44s)]
*  Put straight up. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2439.92s)]
*  And I think to that point, a lot of people just like be honest with yourself. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2440.92s)]
*  Who are you? [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2445.36s)]
*  What are you willing to do? [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2446.36s)]
*  And the thing that trips me out is like, if you determine that you're not willing to be [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2447.7200000000003s)]
*  this industrious entrepreneurial type of spirit, if that's like, you realize that's not real [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2452.0s)]
*  to you, it's like, okay, you bring in someone or a company and they give you millions of [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2456.88s)]
*  dollars and take this massive gamble on you. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2460.92s)]
*  Of course you don't have the leverage in the situation. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2464.96s)]
*  They're taking all the risk. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2468.8s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2469.8s)]
*  If you determine that, oh, I just want to make songs and I want y'all to risk millions [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2471.52s)]
*  of dollars on me, why would you have the good deal in that situation? [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2477.36s)]
*  They're taking all the risk. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2482.96s)]
*  Life is leverage. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2483.96s)]
*  And I think the reality, and maybe in the future this is what's going to happen, but [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2484.96s)]
*  artists have a louder voice than labels. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2490.36s)]
*  I'm not advocating for labels. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2491.76s)]
*  I've never been anti-label. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2493.16s)]
*  I've been anti-bad deals. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2494.72s)]
*  I've been anti-exploitation. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2496.6s)]
*  I've been anti-not owning your shit. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2498.6s)]
*  I've never been, oh, anti-major label. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2500.48s)]
*  It's just anti-bad deals. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2502.8799999999997s)]
*  But the artists have a louder voice than the labels. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2505.56s)]
*  So maybe in the future labels will be famous. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2508.2799999999997s)]
*  The dude at the label is famous and he has a voice and he's saying, look, we spent millions [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2511.04s)]
*  of dollars, we risked millions of dollars on you. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2517.04s)]
*  You had 10,000 monthly listeners and we still put up 2 million on your potential. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2521.48s)]
*  Why would you get the bigger end of the straw? [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2526.32s)]
*  Makes no sense. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2530.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2531.4s)]
*  I think it's logical. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2532.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2533.4s)]
*  I think it makes sense. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2534.4s)]
*  Just remove the labels and all this shit. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2535.4s)]
*  If you've got a friend who needs, they're a musician or whatever and they're like, oh, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2540.32s)]
*  I really want to do this music thing. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2543.92s)]
*  Take away music. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2545.48s)]
*  Do it with a restaurant. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2546.48s)]
*  Restaurant. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2547.48s)]
*  Okay, fine. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2548.48s)]
*  Go, go, go. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2549.48s)]
*  And it's like they don't want to do anything but run the restaurant, whatever the fuck [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2550.48s)]
*  it is. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2554.96s)]
*  They want to cook food. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2555.96s)]
*  They want to cook food. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2556.96s)]
*  That's all they want to do is make food. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2557.96s)]
*  But they need the money. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2558.96s)]
*  They need 2 million to open up a restaurant. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2559.96s)]
*  So you give them 2 million and then they're confused when the money comes in that you're [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2560.96s)]
*  getting more. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2564.28s)]
*  I'm cooking the food. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2565.28s)]
*  Why are you doing this? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2566.28s)]
*  It's like, motherfucker. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2567.28s)]
*  This doesn't happen. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2568.28s)]
*  Not even this doesn't happen. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2569.28s)]
*  It's like I took all the risk. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2570.28s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2571.28s)]
*  You don't get paid for work, you get paid for risk. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2572.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2573.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2574.28s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2575.28s)]
*  And it's like I think a lot of times artists forget that. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2577.28s)]
*  Now that's not to say that they can take advantage of those situations. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2581.5600000000004s)]
*  No, like I said, I'm anti-exploitation, but at the same time, be real with yourself. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2584.5600000000004s)]
*  If you are somebody who's like, I'm not willing to do anything but go to the studio, and you [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2589.92s)]
*  also take all the risk, that's fine. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2595.2000000000003s)]
*  But then also know what kind of situation you're going to end up being in. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2598.28s)]
*  It's going to be them. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2601.96s)]
*  They're going to come out on top because they're taking all the risk. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2603.08s)]
*  I'm curious to hear what's your opinion on Residencies. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2605.68s)]
*  I feel like the look of them has changed. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2608.72s)]
*  They used to be like, ah, they'll... [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2611.84s)]
*  Your career's done. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2613.48s)]
*  You're on the back nine of your career. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2614.48s)]
*  Now it's like people want Residencies. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2615.48s)]
*  What Usher did was fantastic. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2618.08s)]
*  Britney Spears. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2621.48s)]
*  Britney, I think, is a little loony bin, but Usher, she just got a... [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2622.48s)]
*  What makes you say that? [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2627.6s)]
*  She got kicked out of the Four Seasons forever because she went naked into the pool or something [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2628.6s)]
*  like that. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2632.92s)]
*  Oh, that's fire. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2633.92s)]
*  Britney really gone through it. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2634.92s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2635.92s)]
*  Have you smashed? [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2636.92s)]
*  What? [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2637.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2638.92s)]
*  You're famous, bro. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2639.92s)]
*  You're a famous musician, bro. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2640.92s)]
*  He said, I never met her. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2641.92s)]
*  That's why. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2642.92s)]
*  You know what's so funny? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2643.92s)]
*  There's a clip of her running naked on the beach to what they want. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2644.92s)]
*  No. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2649.1600000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2650.1600000000003s)]
*  That's why I asked that question. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2651.1600000000003s)]
*  It was in the ether, bro. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2652.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2653.1600000000003s)]
*  No, I mean, Residencies for me, I'm not going to Vegas like that. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2654.1600000000003s)]
*  Saudi, though. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2657.4s)]
*  You could have a Residency for the next 25 years. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2658.4s)]
*  And that's nothing against Vegas. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2660.1600000000003s)]
*  I love the Vegas fans. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2661.1600000000003s)]
*  The city to me is like, I can't. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2662.76s)]
*  You're just going to eat away. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2664.4s)]
*  I just don't like the environment like that. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2665.4s)]
*  Let's say it's someplace else. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2667.28s)]
*  Yeah, I think if, look. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2668.28s)]
*  Sa-caw-cus, New Jersey. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2671.28s)]
*  Geez up, Sa-caw-cus. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2672.28s)]
*  I think if it makes sense for you, yeah. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2676.2000000000003s)]
*  You go somewhere six times a year and you already love the place anyway and they're [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2678.88s)]
*  giving you a meal or whatever. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2682.56s)]
*  It's like, yeah, why not? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2684.0800000000004s)]
*  Do you think younger artists should start doing Residencies or have the key? [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2685.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, because it's soft ticket. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2689.88s)]
*  And a lot of times like... [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2692.6s)]
*  Can you explain what that means for people who are outside of... [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2693.6s)]
*  Soft ticket is people are going to be there anyway. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2695.6s)]
*  So if I perform at a club on a Friday night, it's a soft ticket show because guess what? [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2698.64s)]
*  If I'm not there, they're still there. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2704.08s)]
*  By club, you mean if you go to Live or Eleven in Miami. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2705.56s)]
*  There was already going to be people there. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2708.88s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2710.56s)]
*  Whereas with Vegas casinos, there's already people that are there. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2711.56s)]
*  And they're going to look for something to do besides gamble. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2715.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2717.64s)]
*  Here's just the entertainment for the night. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2718.64s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2719.64s)]
*  So it's supposed to like, I'm at Barclays, pull up. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2720.64s)]
*  That's like, if y'all don't show up, no one's there. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2724.8399999999997s)]
*  Nobody was at Barclays that night. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2727.4s)]
*  And then, oh, Russ is here? [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2729.2s)]
*  You are the ticket. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2731.2s)]
*  Right, you're the ticket. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2732.2s)]
*  So yeah, I mean, it's a soft ticket play. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2733.2s)]
*  So the pressure's off of you because there's going to be people there anyway. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2735.8399999999997s)]
*  You don't need to do crazy promotion about it because there's going to be people there [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2738.7999999999997s)]
*  anyway. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2742.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, smart. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2743.2799999999997s)]
*  Do it. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2744.2799999999997s)]
*  You could save on production costs if you're parking yourself at a destination or risk [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2745.2799999999997s)]
*  10 arena cities or let me do a big up show at a place where we all know Vegas, everyone's [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2749.44s)]

*  Realistically. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2850.44s)]
*  Because I'm on an island, right? [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2851.44s)]
*  So I dig my heels in the sand and I say, these people over there, they're trying to fuck [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2853.48s)]
*  me and it's like, well, bro, what'd you expect? [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2858.92s)]
*  There's this whole circle right here of people on the inside that are trying to protect this [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2861.56s)]

*  You're surprised they're doing everything they can to shut this down. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2868.0s)]
*  People don't like bullies and it's like if we hear a story of a big bully is trying to [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2873.08s)]
*  blackball this independent young artist, like, yeah, I think that would galvanize more people [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2877.4s)]
*  to support. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2882.32s)]
*  Maybe, but I think it would do more harm than good. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2884.32s)]
*  Then you have other people that might be like, oh, he's complaining, he's making this up. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2887.56s)]
*  It would more so be that narrative of you're just bitter, you're just mad and it would [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2891.08s)]
*  also like the labels are in cahoots with everything and everyone. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2895.56s)]
*  So you attack one, you attack one. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2901.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, oh, you want to come out and say this, well, kiss your complex interview [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2903.32s)]

*  Radio still is valuable. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2917.72s)]
*  It's still, yeah, there's still a game there to be played, especially at pop radio. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2921.08s)]
*  You make a shit ton of money on the publishing side. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2926.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2928.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2929.96s)]

*  Yeah, because of the program. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=2933.7999999999997s)]

*  No, but what I'll say is that- [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3056.48s)]
*  What's the difference? [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3059.48s)]
*  What's the difference? [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3060.48s)]
*  What I'll say is that- [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3061.48s)]
*  Where's the ginger? [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3062.48s)]
*  Yeah, like, I'm like, fucking I do it myself, and they're like- [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3063.48s)]
*  You gotta sing all his- [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3068.04s)]
*  No, you are gonna do it yourself. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3069.04s)]
*  We're not singing nothing. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3070.04s)]
*  Like, damn. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3071.04s)]
*  We're not here. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3072.04s)]
*  No, but what I'll say is with the stadium, there's so many fucking people that you can't [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3073.04s)]
*  even see. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3076.84s)]
*  You really can only see the first couple rows. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3077.84s)]
*  And that's a die-hard fan. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3080.36s)]
*  It's almost for me, even at my own shows, it dictates the whole energy. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3081.36s)]
*  And so the first couple rows at the shows, it was filled with fans of mine who are so [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3084.6800000000003s)]
*  like die-hard. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3088.52s)]
*  So I was right at home. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3089.52s)]
*  It was fine. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3090.52s)]
*  It was completely, yeah, yeah. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3091.52s)]
*  You want more? [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3092.52s)]
*  One in Rome. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3093.52s)]
*  Might as well. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3094.52s)]
*  Okay, so any adjustment with the stadium though? [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3095.52s)]
*  Size, does that- [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3100.52s)]
*  No, you know what? [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3102.2400000000002s)]
*  And I've said this before about arenas. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3103.52s)]
*  Areas and stadiums are easier to do than, like performing for 80,000 people, way easier [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3106.48s)]
*  than performing for this amount of people. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3116.0s)]
*  Because this amount of people, like, y'all are all just right here. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3118.64s)]
*  There's no hiding and there's no like- [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3123.4s)]
*  Silence is louder. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3125.2s)]
*  It's so intimate. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3126.2s)]
*  80,000 people, you're sort of, I don't know, it's like surreal. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3127.2s)]
*  You're just kind of like, you're there and they're there, but y'all are not that connected. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3130.68s)]
*  I don't know how to explain it. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3135.56s)]
*  It's, yeah. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3136.56s)]
*  It's easy. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3137.56s)]
*  Oh yeah, for sure. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3138.56s)]
*  For sure. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3139.56s)]
*  I don't know what that is, but- [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3140.56s)]
*  And probably once you get them moving too, it's like a train. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3141.56s)]
*  That momentum is so much- [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3144.8s)]
*  And the energy is so palpable. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3146.16s)]
*  And like I said, it's just, it's different than feeling like I need to personally connect [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3148.16s)]
*  with each seven people in the room right now, because there's only seven. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3153.64s)]
*  There's 80,000 people. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3157.32s)]
*  I just need to like crush this and be in my world and like feed off the energy and whatever. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3158.72s)]
*  But yeah, I don't know. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3163.48s)]
*  It was an experience. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3165.44s)]
*  What's the smallest show you ever did? [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3166.44s)]
*  Oh man, probably like 40 people. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3167.84s)]
*  Oh no, what am I talking about? [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3170.2s)]
*  Four people, Atlanta, 20, I'll tell you the exact date, December 6, 2014. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3171.96s)]
*  Okay, four people. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3177.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3178.84s)]
*  What's the venue? [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3179.84s)]
*  Masquerade in Atlanta. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3180.84s)]
*  Okay, you show up, you do the whole show? [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3181.84s)]
*  No, so Diamond, the label that me and my boy started, we were like gung ho about the show, [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3183.64s)]
*  the showcase that we had set up, like yo, it's December 6, and everyone pulled up. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3189.72s)]
*  My dad got us a fucking limo or something. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3195.9199999999996s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3198.08s)]
*  And we thought we were the shit. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3199.08s)]
*  We're like in the limo with champagne bottles and we're taking pictures of the marquee. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3201.6s)]
*  We show up and literally four people, and we crushed. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3207.3199999999997s)]
*  Oh, you did the whole show? [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3211.6s)]
*  Oh yeah, and I mean, that was the thing back then, bro. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3213.2s)]
*  I was like, all you had to go off of was your delusional confidence in yourself. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3216.72s)]
*  So that was like, for me, it didn't matter who was in the crowd. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3221.24s)]
*  I was, I envy that person, sometimes characteristics of that person, because I was just happy to [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3225.2799999999997s)]
*  be on stage. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3230.7599999999998s)]
*  I think like who was in the audience was irrelevant. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3231.7599999999998s)]
*  I was just happy to be in a light that I always saw myself in. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3236.3599999999997s)]
*  Oh wow, so there's no embarrassment like these people. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3240.8799999999997s)]
*  Oh my God, none at all. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3243.64s)]
*  Wow. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3245.6s)]
*  None at all. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3246.6s)]
*  I felt zero embarrassment for that night. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3247.6s)]
*  More embarrassment in a 7,000 cap venue if only 6,000 show up. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3250.12s)]
*  Wow. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3254.8399999999997s)]
*  Do you keep in touch with those four people at all? [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3255.8399999999997s)]
*  I assume you guys connected after the show. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3258.08s)]
*  Yeah, some of them are like, we call them, one of his name is Nick Everett. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3259.52s)]
*  And like me and Boogus, who I started Diamond with, we refer to a lot of people as like, [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3262.7999999999997s)]
*  oh yeah, he's a Nick Everett. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3268.6s)]
*  It's this dude from Tennessee. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3269.6s)]
*  Yeah, he was the first one to get the logo tattooed on him. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3271.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean, he was at every show. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3275.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, but it's like to me, I don't know man, like that's what makes all this so much sweeter [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3276.2799999999997s)]
*  is because I wasn't one of those artists who, and I feel for these kind of artists, who [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3284.08s)]
*  you blow up and you haven't even done a show yet. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3288.2799999999997s)]
*  Where are you supposed to go from here? [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3291.3999999999996s)]
*  Like you got songs with hundreds of millions of streams and you haven't done a show yet. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3294.3199999999997s)]
*  That's fucking terrifying. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3298.7599999999998s)]
*  I would have been fucked if that happened. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3299.7599999999998s)]
*  How long did it take you to get your show good? [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3302.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh man, it took me a minute and I'm glad I got to do it in sort of that circuit of when [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3304.7200000000003s)]
*  no one was really paying attention. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3312.56s)]
*  By the time I was really doing shows, I was okay. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3314.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3317.8s)]
*  But I feel for people like Lil Nas X or Olivia Rodrigo. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3318.8s)]
*  Icebites got ripped, it was her first time on stage and she's not as compelling as this. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3321.12s)]
*  Was that her first time on stage? [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3325.8s)]
*  It was an outdoor show, she did something and they were kind of clowning. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3326.8s)]
*  She's literally never performed in front of people. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3330.2400000000002s)]
*  I remember when Olivia Rodrigo, she blew up and the shit went crazy and she posted her [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3332.44s)]
*  first tour and it was like 2,500 caps. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3337.28s)]
*  Obviously she could have done arenas and everyone was like, what the fuck? [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3340.2000000000003s)]
*  Because her fans are like, there's so many of us, why would you book such small rooms? [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3344.2400000000002s)]
*  Because she got to learn how to hand out. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3348.6400000000003s)]
*  She's never done this. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3350.44s)]
*  Even 2,500 is a lot for the artists for the first time. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3351.88s)]
*  When I tell you, I remember 2014, Dane from Funk Volume, which was the label that hops [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3354.64s)]
*  in and was on, right? [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3362.12s)]
*  I remember he had reached out 2014 and he was like, we were talking about maybe doing [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3364.08s)]
*  a deal. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3368.12s)]
*  He brings me out to Colorado to do a set before hops in and Funk Volume and shit and I brought [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3369.12s)]
*  Boogas. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3374.68s)]
*  I remember being in the parking lot. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3376.32s)]
*  The venue was Cervantes Ballroom. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3378.08s)]
*  There was 1,100 people and I was freaking the fuck out in the parking lot, like 1,100. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3379.94s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3386.42s)]
*  And I remember getting up on stage. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3387.42s)]
*  I remember asking Boogas, like, yo, can you just come up on stage with me? [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3389.7000000000003s)]
*  Because this is like, I don't even think I can do this. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3393.26s)]
*  And I remember going up on stage and 1,100 people, it might as well have been a million. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3396.54s)]
*  It felt so out of control. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3402.18s)]
*  It felt like, what's crazy is if I had never done anything past that point, that person [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3405.54s)]
*  would just think I made it. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3410.34s)]
*  It's like, what do you mean? [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3411.34s)]
*  Performing for 1,100 people. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3414.34s)]
*  It felt so crazy and it just, moments like that helped me maintain perspective on how [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3418.86s)]
*  big things have gotten and how real shit is and it gives me the ability to have empathy [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3425.34s)]
*  for artists like you said, like Ice Spice or Olivia Rodrigo. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3429.5s)]
*  2,500 people is insane. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3432.8199999999997s)]
*  1,100 is insane. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3435.3799999999997s)]
*  500 is insane. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3437.02s)]
*  You don't understand, like, if you haven't done this shit yet and you go up, you just [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3438.8199999999997s)]
*  get thrusted up on stage, you got 300, 400 people like, you gotta entertain us. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3443.8199999999997s)]
*  It's a lot if you've never done that. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3450.94s)]
*  There's a lot of pressure on that, especially if it's like, yo, we're here for you. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3452.4199999999996s)]
*  We're the ones supporting your music. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3456.18s)]
*  Don't let us down. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3457.58s)]
*  It's a lot. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3458.58s)]
*  What was the last show you did where you felt that pressure of that opening show with 1,100 [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3459.98s)]
*  people? [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3463.94s)]
*  Hollywood Bowl and Staples Center, I was a little freaked out right before I walked out. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3464.94s)]
*  It's weird because I don't get nervous before shows anymore because I know they're all there [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3470.54s)]
*  for me. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3474.06s)]
*  It's like clockwork, I do this in my sleep, right? [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3475.74s)]
*  Staples Center was like, oh fuck. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3478.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta bring it. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3481.2599999999998s)]
*  I wasn't nervous until literally as I'm walking out and I was like, whoa, this is Staples [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3482.38s)]
*  Because I'm looking up and it's sold out up to the fucking boxes up top. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3488.6200000000003s)]
*  I'm like, dog, this is the Lakers game. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3493.38s)]
*  When you do an arena, they customize the whole back area so on the ground instead of a basketball [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3496.86s)]
*  or whatever the fuck logo, it's like circles with my name. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3504.54s)]
*  The fucking owner of Live Nation has given me iPads with like, congrats, you sold out [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3508.34s)]
*  Staples Center theme shit. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3512.3s)]
*  I'm like, holy fuck. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3513.54s)]
*  My parents are here. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3515.7400000000002s)]
*  People are watching. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3517.74s)]
*  How was the show? [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3518.74s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3519.74s)]
*  Could you, did you lock in during it or were there moments where you were actually reflecting [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3520.74s)]
*  on the fact that you were at Staples? [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3525.66s)]
*  I think a lot of times, and I wonder if artists do, I disassociate on stage sometimes where [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3526.66s)]
*  it's almost like y'all are watching me have an imposter syndrome attack in the middle [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3531.7799999999997s)]
*  of my set. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3537.4599999999996s)]
*  Because a lot of times during songs, I'm like, I can't believe these people are on stage. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3538.4599999999996s)]
*  I'm just like, what are these people doing here? [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3545.86s)]
*  Then you gotta like remind yourself, no, stay in it. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3547.86s)]
*  Oh god, sometimes. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3550.86s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, Staples Center was one of those ones I was like, especially because that time [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3553.86s)]
*  I wasn't doing in-ears. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3558.7s)]
*  In-ears means you have the song playing from the monitor. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3559.7s)]
*  How do you not do in-ears? [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3563.38s)]
*  Yeah, so like, I fucking hated in-ears because I wanted to be a monk. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3564.38s)]
*  Explain the in-ears for the people. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3568.38s)]
*  So in-ears is this, like if you do in-ears, like traditionally, all you're gonna hear, [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3570.38s)]
*  you're wearing headphones, right? [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3575.34s)]
*  You see the artists, they have that like FBI shit in their ear while they're performing. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3576.34s)]
*  All you're gonna hear is the backing track. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3579.34s)]
*  You hear no crowd. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3582.78s)]
*  It's like you're in the studio. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3584.2200000000003s)]
*  So you're a little detached from the crowd. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3585.6200000000003s)]
*  You're performing and you just hear your vocals that you're singing over the backing track, [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3587.98s)]
*  over the instrumental, and you're looking at the crowd and they're, it's like what the [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3592.34s)]
*  fuck? [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3598.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3599.46s)]
*  So I just never fucked with that, right? [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3600.46s)]
*  So no in-ears. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3601.58s)]
*  And so that's like crazy to people in the music business because like how did you even [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3604.14s)]
*  hear yourself? [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3607.62s)]
*  And how did you? [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3608.62s)]
*  Did you have the monitors high on the stage? [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3609.62s)]
*  Yeah, I always would have the monitors super high on the stage and I would just wing it. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3610.9s)]
*  The speakers on the stage that actually face the artists and that's kind of how you can [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3615.94s)]
*  see how you sound. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3620.42s)]
*  But I agree with you, like feeling the audience is important and like that can be distorted [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3621.9s)]
*  if you're only hearing a backing track. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3626.02s)]
*  Even now I use in-ears but I do one in, one out. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3628.2599999999998s)]
*  One in, one out, it seems like a compromise. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3630.54s)]
*  You gotta hear them. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3632.2599999999998s)]
*  Because otherwise it's tough, like I tried to do, you know, where your monitor guy sort [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3633.42s)]
*  of tries to like ride the crowd volume. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3638.0200000000004s)]
*  Oh, I don't like that. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3640.3s)]
*  I hate it. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3641.6200000000003s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3642.6200000000003s)]
*  Like all of a sudden you're performing. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3643.6200000000003s)]
*  Tell him. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3644.6200000000003s)]
*  Tell him. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3645.6200000000003s)]
*  Tell him. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3646.6200000000003s)]
*  It's like crazy. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3647.6200000000003s)]
*  Every time when we're doing the walkthrough I have to tell him, I go, I might get quieter. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3648.6200000000003s)]
*  Don't adjust. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3653.0200000000004s)]
*  Leave it. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3654.0200000000004s)]
*  I'm doing that on purpose. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3655.0200000000004s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3656.0200000000004s)]
*  One dB. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3657.0200000000004s)]

*  And I was kind of like wowing a little bit during the soundcheck and the promoters were [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3961.86s)]
*  getting a little nervous. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3965.26s)]
*  Sure. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3966.26s)]
*  I can imagine what you're saying. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3967.26s)]
*  Did you have to cut anything out? [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3968.26s)]
*  I ain't cut anything. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3969.82s)]
*  I presented the list of what he couldn't say and he violated every single thing. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3971.02s)]
*  And I was like, yo, they're not going to arrest me. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3974.46s)]
*  I had the same thought. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3976.7000000000003s)]
*  It can't happen to me. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3977.7000000000003s)]
*  This is a bad idea. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3978.7000000000003s)]
*  But I remember them getting nervous and then basically the way that they positioned it [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3979.7000000000003s)]
*  was that they would go after the promoter, I think it was. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3985.98s)]
*  Yeah, like, you know, the promoter would be worried about this. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3990.54s)]
*  They would be responsible as well. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3993.5800000000004s)]
*  It's also, yeah, you want to go back, right? [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=3995.34s)]
*  I'll say this, they were fantastic. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4000.26s)]
*  They got a great sense of humor. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4003.0600000000004s)]
*  Obviously, don't talk about Mohammed, but like just talking about them. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4004.46s)]
*  Like I posted a video. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4008.34s)]
*  I'm making fun of them for the first 10, 15 minutes. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4010.46s)]
*  Like, nuance it just about their culture. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4013.3s)]
*  They love it. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4016.2200000000003s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4017.2200000000003s)]
*  We think that they don't want to make fun of themselves, but they don't want to laugh. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4018.2200000000003s)]
*  They do. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4020.1400000000003s)]
*  Don't talk about Mohammed. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4021.1400000000003s)]
*  Talk about everybody else. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4022.1400000000003s)]
*  And you never think that, but it makes the most sense when you pull it back because it's [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4023.1400000000003s)]
*  like God is God. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4025.7000000000003s)]
*  We're not God. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4027.7400000000002s)]
*  We're just people. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4028.7400000000002s)]
*  You know what traveling does? [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4030.7s)]
*  And like I just brought my dad on this trip that I just went on. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4031.7s)]
*  He doesn't come around a lot. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4034.06s)]
*  And it was so interesting to watch his perspective sort of open. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4035.06s)]
*  But to that point, it's like when you travel to all these different parts of the world, [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4039.14s)]
*  what you realize, everyone is a human. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4043.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4045.2599999999998s)]
*  Everyone is just a person. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4046.2599999999998s)]
*  I didn't see them as humans either, bro. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4047.2599999999998s)]
*  I agree. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4048.2599999999998s)]
*  Nah, dude. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4049.2599999999998s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4050.2599999999998s)]
*  Just white people. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4051.2599999999998s)]
*  Just white people. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4052.2599999999998s)]
*  No, but it's like, you know, you watch the news and you see shit. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4053.2599999999998s)]
*  You think that people are like. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4055.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4056.8199999999997s)]
*  Japanese people are this way. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4057.8199999999997s)]
*  It's like, bro, everyone has the same internal trauma. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4058.9s)]
*  Japanese people are odd, though. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4063.02s)]
*  Everyone has humor. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4064.02s)]
*  Japanese people are odd, son. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4065.02s)]
*  We got to acknowledge that. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4066.02s)]
*  Take it. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4067.02s)]
*  Have you been to Japan? [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4068.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4069.02s)]
*  They're odd. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4070.02s)]
*  They're odd. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4071.02s)]
*  They're the most odd. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4072.02s)]
*  Just all of them. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4073.02s)]
*  Every sense. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4074.02s)]
*  What do you think? [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4075.02s)]
*  Every sense, they're the most odd. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4076.02s)]
*  And I don't like how we can't acknowledge it. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4077.02s)]
*  That's why we go. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4078.02s)]
*  Because they're odd. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4079.02s)]
*  If they was normal, we wouldn't go. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4080.02s)]
*  I think Japan is fucking awesome. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4081.02s)]
*  I'll tell you why. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4082.02s)]
*  I didn't say it's not awesome. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4083.02s)]
*  No, I think Japanese people are moving off of a ill honor code. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4084.02s)]
*  I fuck with it. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4088.42s)]
*  You go out there. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4089.42s)]
*  There's no one at the grocery store. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4090.42s)]
*  It's just an honor code. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4091.9s)]
*  Leave the money in the back. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4092.9s)]
*  That's odd. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4093.9s)]
*  Ain't that odd? [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4094.9s)]
*  Or good. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4095.9s)]
*  Nobody's eating? [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4096.9s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4097.9s)]
*  I'm saying. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4098.9s)]
*  No employees to make sure you're not stealing. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4099.9s)]
*  Because they just know you're not going to steal shit. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4100.9s)]
*  That's odd. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4101.9s)]
*  That's awesome. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4102.9s)]
*  That's fire. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4103.9s)]
*  No, it's awesome. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4104.9s)]
*  There could be awesome. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4105.9s)]
*  The food that they make is awesome. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4106.9s)]
*  It's odd that when I see two people on a date. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4107.9s)]
*  I think odd has a negative connotation, but it is odd. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4108.9s)]
*  Listen, there's some things that are good. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4110.86s)]
*  There's some things that are good. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4112.86s)]
*  There's some things that are bad. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4113.86s)]
*  My boy passed out in the street. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4115.299999999999s)]
*  Shout out to Ben. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4116.299999999999s)]
*  Ben Hanna passed out in the street. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4117.299999999999s)]
*  He woke up. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4118.46s)]
*  In Japan, he passed out in the street. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4119.46s)]
*  Passed out in the street. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4120.46s)]
*  Blacked out, passed out in the street. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4121.46s)]
*  Woke up in the morning. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4122.46s)]
*  They had his socks and shoes next to him. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4123.46s)]
*  And his socks rolled up and stuffed into the thing. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4125.66s)]
*  Isn't that fucking incredible? [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4127.74s)]
*  That's odd, because they were jerking off to his feet. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4128.74s)]
*  That's the thing that you didn't realize. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4130.74s)]
*  Is that proven? [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4131.74s)]
*  That's not true. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4132.74s)]
*  You're speculating. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4133.74s)]
*  See, now is that proven? [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4134.74s)]
*  Where's the footage? [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4135.74s)]
*  Can I see that? [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4136.74s)]
*  Travel though, your India clip was crazy. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4137.74s)]
*  Can you talk to me about that whole experience? [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4141.62s)]
*  Bro, India, I felt like Justin Bieber. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4144.62s)]
*  I was like, oh, this is like a little taste. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4147.62s)]
*  That was a crazy clip, dude. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4149.62s)]
*  Can we show it? [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4150.62s)]
*  It's rock star shit. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4151.62s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if it's... [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4152.62s)]
*  Oh my God, bro. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4153.62s)]
*  First of all, India is like the fastest growing market on Spotify. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4154.62s)]
*  It's a massive country. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4159.62s)]
*  The people are so loving, so supportive. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4160.62s)]
*  I've not seen people go that hard for me. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4163.62s)]
*  There's only one thing that's good about India. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4166.62s)]
*  There's only so many groups of people who really match that level of intensity. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4170.5s)]
*  Man, I went to India the second I landed. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4173.5s)]
*  There's people at the airport, which I'm not used to, like fans lined up. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4177.099999999999s)]
*  On the NBA championship shit? [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4180.5s)]
*  Yeah, but respectful, like maintaining six feet. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4182.5s)]
*  Not like, yo. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4186.8s)]
*  Oh, they don't do that with us. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4187.8s)]
*  No. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4189.8s)]
*  It was just like, whoa, y'all are clearly diehard fans, but it was so respectful and [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4190.8s)]
*  the shows were fucking... [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4195.7s)]

*  Okay, if you're like a... [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4270.34s)]
*  Latinos. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4271.34s)]
*  Let's say again. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4272.34s)]
*  Latinos. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4273.34s)]
*  No, not what race is the most attractive. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4274.34s)]
*  We know that. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4275.84s)]

*  He does that to everybody. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4304.62s)]
*  He agrees. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4305.62s)]
*  Anytime he calls you, he sucks too. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4306.62s)]
*  I said this was actually a race. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4307.62s)]
*  I said this was actually a race. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4308.62s)]

*  He is an African 12. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4323.4s)]
*  You wouldn't be least attracted to the black. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4324.4s)]
*  It's interesting to learn the conversion rate. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4329.4s)]
*  Yeah, what is the conversion? [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4331.4s)]
*  Like, what is he as half black, half white? [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4332.4s)]
*  That's a fine ass half black with the good hair. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4334.4s)]

*  That was too long. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4349.179999999999s)]
*  He's a bad person. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4350.179999999999s)]
*  You're a bad friend. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4351.179999999999s)]

*  I know who you are. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4353.179999999999s)]
*  Not to shift the silly topic to a real thing, but I do think this is an opportunity to actually [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4354.179999999999s)]
*  talk about something real. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4358.0599999999995s)]
*  It's just talking about fuck. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4359.82s)]
*  Sounds like you're about to make it gay as fuck. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4361.82s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4363.82s)]
*  When I first blew up, there was so much like, what is he? [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4367.24s)]
*  And I do think that to ignore that is dismissive. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4370.24s)]
*  Like, that played a big role in my success. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4375.24s)]
*  Oh, that everybody felt like they could... [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4378.24s)]
*  Everybody felt like they could see themselves in me. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4380.24s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4383.24s)]
*  100%. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4384.24s)]
*  Yeah, because... [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4385.24s)]
*  And I've said it before in an interview. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4386.24s)]
*  It's something that they can't because they ugly. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4387.24s)]
*  You can't see yourself in me. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4390.24s)]
*  Being white or racially ambiguous online makes it easier to reach the masses. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4392.66s)]
*  Right? [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4399.66s)]
*  See, I just... [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4400.66s)]
*  Makes it harder to reach hip hop because hip hop is black. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4401.66s)]
*  And so it's very clear I'm not black, but it makes it easier to reach the masses. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4405.66s)]
*  And to ignore that is dismissive. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4409.66s)]
*  And I know that when I first blew up, Saudi was like... [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4412.66s)]
*  The whole Middle East was like, oh, you're Middle Eastern. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4415.66s)]
*  So we super love you. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4417.66s)]
*  And then like... [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4421.08s)]
*  We could pass for a lot of your life. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4422.08s)]
*  Hispanic people... [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4423.08s)]

*  He doesn't leave me. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4429.08s)]
*  Give me a love fade in two weeks in the Mediterranean. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4430.08s)]
*  Wait, do Italians really fuck with you? [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4435.08s)]
*  Yeah, but you know what's so funny? [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4438.08s)]
*  When I did a show in Italy, I'm doing a show and it's like a regular show. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4439.08s)]
*  It's fucking turn and like halfway through the show, I was like, oh, fuck, I'm Italian. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4443.08s)]
*  I gotta play this card right now. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4449.5s)]
*  I was like, oh shit. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4452.5s)]
*  I was wondering why I felt so much... [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4453.5s)]
*  Because you didn't grow up in like a... [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4455.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4457.5s)]
*  It just felt like home in a different way. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4458.5s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4461.5s)]
*  Like, it dawned on me all of a sudden like, whoa, everyone in the room is Italian. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4462.5s)]
*  This is crazy. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4467.5s)]
*  Because when you do a show in America, there's not the sense of patriotism where it's like, [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4469.5s)]
*  yo, everyone's American in here. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4474.5s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4476.5s)]
*  I'm doing a show in Italy and I'm Italian. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4477.92s)]
*  It took a second because I'm just running through the motions, but then I was like, [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4480.92s)]
*  whoa, everyone in here is Italian. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4483.92s)]
*  So like six songs deep, I'm like, did I tell you all that I'm Italian? [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4485.92s)]
*  Did I mention? [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4488.92s)]
*  I was like, we don't give a fuck. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4489.92s)]
*  I'm like, keep going. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4492.92s)]
*  No, I do get that. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4493.92s)]
*  Like when we did the show in Scotland, my mom's from Scotland, and when we did the show [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4494.92s)]
*  there... [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4499.92s)]
*  It feels a little bit different. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4500.92s)]
*  Yeah, it felt like I wanted to hang out with them for longer to be... [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4501.92s)]
*  I don't even know... [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4503.92s)]
*  I don't even know... [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4504.92s)]
*  I mean, I can't even reflect on that. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4506.34s)]
*  Light it up a little bit. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4507.34s)]
*  Yeah, and it feels like they're excited that you come from the same place that they came [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4508.34s)]
*  from and the same culture kind of bleeds through you. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4511.22s)]
*  Of course. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4513.82s)]
*  There's that connection point that's... [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4514.82s)]
*  I mean, you guys are doing shows in India, right? [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4515.82s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, anytime I go to India, I'm like, oh, yo, this is... [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4517.82s)]
*  I know we laugh because I don't know enough about India. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4520.62s)]
*  I don't speak Hindi well enough, but my soul is like, yo, I'm home right now. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4522.74s)]
*  I don't cry talking about India. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4526.82s)]
*  You can feel it. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4527.82s)]
*  I'm like, yo, this is it. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4528.82s)]
*  I'm home. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4529.82s)]
*  Nah, it's incredible. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4530.82s)]
*  What country smells the best? [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4531.82s)]
*  I'm going to go with Italy. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4532.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4533.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4534.82s)]
*  Those are clumpy. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4536.719999999999s)]
*  Now, as a follow-up question. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4537.719999999999s)]
*  How ugly are Scottish women? [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4538.719999999999s)]
*  What could fall from there? [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4544.719999999999s)]
*  I'm just saying, as a follow-up question. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4545.719999999999s)]
*  What was the layup? [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4546.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4547.719999999999s)]
*  Which Asian is the oddest? [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4548.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4549.719999999999s)]
*  No, which is the oddest, though? [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4550.719999999999s)]
*  Which is Asian is the oddest? [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4551.719999999999s)]
*  They just are. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4552.719999999999s)]
*  They just are. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4553.719999999999s)]
*  They're not a little odd. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4554.719999999999s)]
*  Come on, bro. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4555.719999999999s)]
*  But see, I think odd. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4556.719999999999s)]
*  I really think they're just perfectionists at everything they do. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4557.719999999999s)]
*  Odd is a negative product. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4558.719999999999s)]
*  Everything is trying to be perfect. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4559.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, odd is a negative product. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4560.719999999999s)]
*  I could do that. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4561.719999999999s)]
*  I could do that. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4562.719999999999s)]
*  I could do that. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4563.719999999999s)]
*  I could tell you. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4565.62s)]
*  Can we tell them another one? [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4566.62s)]
*  You said yeah, but your soul said no when you looked at me and said yeah. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4567.62s)]
*  You go, yeah. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4570.62s)]
*  You really upset me. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4571.62s)]
*  There are perfectionists in the culture of brief perfection. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4572.62s)]
*  You want me to give you a gem my mom gave me? [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4575.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4577.62s)]
*  Is when somebody has a perspective that's unfamiliar to you. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4578.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4582.62s)]
*  A beautiful response is, that's interesting. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4583.62s)]
*  It's very open-minded. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4586.62s)]
*  So it's like, they're not odd. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4588.62s)]
*  They're interesting. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4590.62s)]
*  It's like, interesting. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4591.62s)]
*  But you know what you mean. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4592.62s)]
*  But interesting is way more positive. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4594.5199999999995s)]
*  You know what you meant and you know what your mom meant. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4596.5199999999995s)]
*  But it's a different energy. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4598.5199999999995s)]
*  Listen, it's a different energy. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4599.5199999999995s)]
*  It's great. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4601.5199999999995s)]
*  But then you go there and you're like, these are some odd ducks. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4602.5199999999995s)]
*  No. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4604.5199999999995s)]
*  They're interesting people. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4605.5199999999995s)]
*  They're particular, maybe. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4606.5199999999995s)]
*  But you could be interesting and odd. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4607.5199999999995s)]
*  They're odd ducks, bro. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4609.5199999999995s)]
*  They are a little odd. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4611.5199999999995s)]
*  I was there. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4612.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm there with my wife. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4613.5199999999995s)]
*  We were there for like two weeks and I was like, wow, you're more odd than I thought. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4614.5199999999995s)]
*  Did you ever consider that you're odd? [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4618.5199999999995s)]
*  To them. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4620.5199999999995s)]
*  To them. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4621.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm odd. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4622.5199999999995s)]
*  That's what's so crazy. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4624.42s)]
*  They are looking at me like you're odd. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4625.42s)]
*  They're looking at us like, these people are fucking off. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4626.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4629.42s)]

*  These motherfuckers are crazy. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4631.42s)]
*  What? [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4632.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4633.42s)]
*  You do some weird stuff. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4634.42s)]
*  I do plenty of weird shit. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4635.42s)]
*  No, just Americans in general are like, we stick out. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4636.42s)]
*  We do. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4639.42s)]
*  He also is odd. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4640.42s)]
*  Like a sore thumb. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4641.42s)]
*  He bites your toenails. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4642.42s)]
*  He said it's the whites. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4643.42s)]
*  He bites your toenails? [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4644.42s)]
*  I can't do it anymore because I'm older, but I did back in the day. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4645.42s)]
*  I gave up on that habit. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4647.42s)]
*  But you did it, though. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4648.42s)]
*  No, I'm kidding. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4649.42s)]
*  I was like, yeah, I used to do that. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4650.42s)]
*  I'm just saying, the Japanese, we appreciate them. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4654.32s)]
*  We love them. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4656.32s)]

*  All that stuff is there. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4668.32s)]
*  Very clean. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4669.32s)]
*  But there's also some oddities that we can appreciate as people who enjoy misfits. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4670.32s)]
*  I like misfits, clearly. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4674.32s)]
*  So I find that the Japanese are misfits. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4676.32s)]

*  But you know what's so interesting? [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4726.12s)]
*  I think for musicians, for me, a place can be boring or whatever. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4728.12s)]
*  Not that Kyoto was. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4735.12s)]

*  I'm like God, I got to get this hand wash that I smelled. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4772.92s)]
*  The Four Seasons in Kyoto. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4774.92s)]

*  And they're like oh, that's exclusive to the Four Seasons. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4780.92s)]
*  I'm like y'all got embargoes on hand wash? [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4782.92s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4784.92s)]
*  I can't fucking buy the soap. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4786.92s)]
*  Do you know you can buy the mattress? [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4788.92s)]
*  Oh, why the pillows? [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4790.92s)]

*  That's how nice the Four Seasons is. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4794.92s)]
*  These rich motherfuckers are smart. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4796.92s)]
*  They monetize the linens. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4799.82s)]
*  You're good at it. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4801.82s)]
*  We got a massage at the Ritz once. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4803.82s)]
*  We didn't even stay there. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4805.82s)]
*  We were like what are these sheets? [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4807.82s)]
*  And then we went and bought those sheets. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4809.82s)]
*  From the spa. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4811.82s)]

*  I need this in my home. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4815.82s)]
*  My thing with the Kyoto was like, [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4817.82s)]
*  I don't know, it just felt like a version of Japan for tourists. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4819.82s)]
*  You know Kyoto used to be the capital of Japan. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4821.82s)]
*  I was like, I'm going to go to Tokyo. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4823.82s)]
*  I'm going to go to Tokyo. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4825.82s)]
*  You know Kyoto used to be the capital. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4828.719999999999s)]
*  I felt the opposite. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4830.719999999999s)]
*  I felt Tokyo was like, oh, this is tourist. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4832.719999999999s)]
*  Kyoto felt like, I'm really amongst. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4834.719999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4836.719999999999s)]
*  The actual people. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4838.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it felt a little bit more... [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4840.719999999999s)]
*  You're going for different reasons. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4842.719999999999s)]
*  You're going for inspiration, you're going to visit. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4844.719999999999s)]
*  And not that inspiration won't strike you. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4846.719999999999s)]
*  Honestly, I'm going for both. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4848.719999999999s)]
*  I'm very much so on the fucking, [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4850.719999999999s)]
*  let me get the guide. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4852.719999999999s)]
*  I want cultural immersion. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4854.719999999999s)]
*  I want to feel what Japanese people felt [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4857.62s)]
*  at this time in history, [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4859.62s)]
*  where the city is kind of locked in. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4861.62s)]
*  You still see the, what are they called? [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4863.62s)]
*  Geishas? [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4865.62s)]
*  Geisha, girls walking down the street and shit like that. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4867.62s)]
*  I guess it's kind of cool, but there were certain things [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4869.62s)]
*  that I saw in Japan that I was like, [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4871.62s)]
*  wow, this is completely unique to Japan. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4873.62s)]
*  You will see no other form of this anywhere else. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4875.62s)]
*  That cultural shock that you experience when you're there [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4877.62s)]
*  is something I've never experienced anywhere else. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4883.62s)]
*  I love it. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4886.5199999999995s)]
*  It was crazy. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4887.5199999999995s)]
*  And because it was odd or interesting, [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4889.5199999999995s)]
*  it was exciting to me. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4891.5199999999995s)]
*  But it was totally unique and different. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4893.5199999999995s)]
*  And in order to get that, you can basically have [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4895.5199999999995s)]
*  nobody live there. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4897.5199999999995s)]
*  They don't let anybody move there, [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4899.5199999999995s)]
*  nobody can become a citizen. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4901.5199999999995s)]
*  Even if you're born there, you're not Japanese. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4903.5199999999995s)]
*  How does that work? [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4905.5199999999995s)]
*  So what are you? [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4907.5199999999995s)]
*  Outsider, bro. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4909.5199999999995s)]
*  You're Korean, you're whatever. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4911.5199999999995s)]
*  They keep it locked in. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4913.5199999999995s)]
*  They have that cultural, what is the word I'm looking for? [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4916.42s)]
*  Homogeny? [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4918.42s)]
*  And it was spectacular. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4920.42s)]
*  The food was amazing. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4922.42s)]
*  But they were so unbelievably different. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4924.42s)]
*  Where I haven't experienced that level of difference. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4926.42s)]
*  Like you go to the Middle East, [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4928.42s)]
*  yeah, there's cultural differences, [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4930.42s)]
*  but there's just kind of an awareness of how we all act. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4932.42s)]
*  And they're so educated abroad that they know how Americans are. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4934.42s)]
*  So they know they're aware. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4936.42s)]
*  Bro, you go to Japan. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4938.42s)]
*  Where have you been in the Middle East? [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4940.42s)]
*  Dubai? [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=4942.42s)]

*  you get out, your skin, I don't know if you ever [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5232.42s)]
*  touched a dolphin, but you feel like a dolphin. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5234.42s)]
*  It's just so smooth. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5237.32s)]
*  The water is holy and blessed. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5239.32s)]
*  I don't get it. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5241.32s)]
*  It was just so serene and peaceful. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5243.32s)]
*  It was one of those moments where you're like, [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5245.32s)]
*  this is what eyes were made for. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5247.32s)]
*  Was to look at this. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5249.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5251.32s)]
*  Lake Lucerne, the Amalfi Coast. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5253.32s)]
*  Amalfi's crazy. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5255.32s)]
*  Yeah, man, Lake Lucerne was just, [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5257.32s)]
*  Amalfi's one of those places that's popular [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5259.32s)]
*  and then you go and you're just like, [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5261.32s)]
*  I don't give a fuck, I get it. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5263.32s)]
*  You know where else I get is Santorini. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5265.32s)]
*  Oh, Santorini, Greece. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5267.32s)]
*  Because Santorini is one of those places where it's like, [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5269.32s)]
*  you loved it. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5271.32s)]
*  Nowhere else in the world looks like that. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5273.32s)]
*  You go to a lot of cities in Europe, [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5275.32s)]
*  and I love all these cities, [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5277.32s)]
*  Paris, London, Amsterdam, Berlin, [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5279.32s)]
*  Brussels, it's like, [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5281.32s)]
*  it all sort of kind of jumbles together at a certain point. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5283.32s)]
*  You go to Santorini, you're like, [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5287.32s)]
*  where the fuck am I? [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5289.32s)]
*  It looks like I'm inside the postcard. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5291.32s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5293.32s)]
*  And I remember thinking about Greek mythology, [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5295.32s)]
*  this part was actually in Athens, [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5297.32s)]
*  but the temple of Poseidon, [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5299.32s)]
*  you're looking over the water, [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5301.32s)]
*  it's similar to Santorini, [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5303.32s)]
*  and you're like, oh, I completely understand thinking, [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5305.32s)]
*  there had to be a god for just this. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5307.32s)]
*  There is a god for just water, [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5309.32s)]
*  because look at what I'm looking at. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5311.32s)]
*  There's no other way around it. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5313.32s)]
*  I'm kind of being Amalfi, [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5315.32s)]
*  and I think we were talking about that [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5317.32s)]
*  because we were in Santorini, [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5319.32s)]
*  and you're looking at dog shit. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5321.32s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5323.32s)]
*  If you were an atheist in Cleveland, I get it. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5325.32s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5327.32s)]
*  But you can't be an atheist in Amalfi, [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5329.32s)]
*  because you're looking at this. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5331.32s)]
*  Yes, because I'm not judging you. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5333.32s)]
*  You're looking at a smokestack, right? [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5335.32s)]
*  But in Amalfi, you're like, [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5337.32s)]
*  no, only god could create something like this. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5339.32s)]
*  In Santorini, same thing. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5341.32s)]
*  You know what this reminds me of? [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5343.32s)]
*  I dreamed of having conversations like these. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5345.32s)]
*  I remember I went to TI's manager's house [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5347.32s)]
*  with Bugis, like 2014, 2015, [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5349.32s)]
*  and it was me, Bugis, Jason Jeter. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5353.32s)]
*  Oh, Jason. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5355.32s)]
*  It was me, Bugis, Jason Jeter, and Killer Mike, [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5357.32s)]
*  and we were sitting in Jason's cigar room, [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5359.32s)]
*  and I had no fans, no money, [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5363.32s)]
*  and we're sitting there, [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5365.32s)]
*  and Killer Mike and Jason are just talking about, [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5367.32s)]
*  like, yo, Croatia. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5369.32s)]
*  And I remember just sitting there like, [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5371.32s)]
*  I don't fucking know. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5373.32s)]
*  And I remember going home and telling my wife, [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5375.32s)]
*  and I remember going home and telling my mom, [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5377.32s)]
*  like, whoa, like, it was crazy. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5379.32s)]
*  They were talking about Croatia, [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5381.32s)]
*  and me and her talked about, [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5383.32s)]
*  because one of her loves is travel, too, [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5385.32s)]
*  and I remember me and her talking about, like, [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5387.32s)]
*  can you imagine what that would be like [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5389.32s)]
*  to be able to sit around and talk about... [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5391.32s)]
*  Have you sent her around? [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5393.32s)]
*  Sent her. She comes with. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5395.32s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5397.32s)]
*  She didn't come to Saudi this time, or Marrakesh. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5399.32s)]
*  She's already been. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5401.32s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5403.32s)]
*  Because to me, I dreamed of this shit, [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5405.32s)]
*  you know, in the fact that [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5407.32s)]
*  I've gone down the rabbit hole before [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5411.32s)]
*  of I want to see my bank balance have more in it, [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5413.32s)]
*  but then I did the second step of that question, [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5417.32s)]
*  which is why. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5419.32s)]
*  And when you get to the why, [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5421.32s)]
*  it gets confronting, because it's like... [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5423.32s)]
*  What's the why? [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5425.32s)]
*  The why was, well, so that I have more money. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5427.32s)]
*  And then it's like, but why? [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5429.32s)]
*  But why? [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5431.32s)]
*  Oh, I guess no reason. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5433.32s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5435.32s)]
*  So then that's when I started just being like, [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5437.32s)]
*  bro, you know what? [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5439.32s)]
*  I'm making the money to... [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5441.32s)]
*  And this is a quote my mom gave me. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5443.32s)]
*  If you have the ability [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5445.32s)]
*  to change somebody's reality, [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5447.32s)]
*  do it. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5449.32s)]
*  And I just use money to change [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5451.32s)]
*  my reality and people I love's reality. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5453.32s)]
*  So I use money [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5455.32s)]
*  to just do [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5457.32s)]
*  fucking epic travel shit [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5459.32s)]
*  with my family and everyone I fuck with. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5461.32s)]
*  That's it. Because it's like, yeah, [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5463.32s)]
*  bro, [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5465.32s)]
*  I could show you the fucking tax [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5467.32s)]
*  document, whatever. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5469.32s)]
*  I've made, and this is three years ago, [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5471.32s)]
*  so it's more than that, but three, [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5473.32s)]
*  four years ago, I had grossed 50 mill. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5475.32s)]
*  Grossed? This is before [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5477.32s)]
*  you have to pay out people? [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5479.32s)]
*  Grossed, grossed 50 mill. So I've made, [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5481.32s)]
*  I had made that much, [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5483.32s)]
*  I spent fucking 49. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5485.32s)]
*  You know what I mean? Because it's like, [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5487.32s)]
*  what else am I doing with it? [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5489.32s)]
*  I feel like [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5491.32s)]
*  the culture [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5493.32s)]
*  of stack [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5495.32s)]
*  is so... [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5497.32s)]
*  It's just you have no [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5501.32s)]
*  connection with the present. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5503.32s)]
*  You're saving for what? [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5505.32s)]
*  A lot of people don't reverse engineer [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5507.32s)]
*  the lifestyle they want. I always tell people, [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5509.32s)]
*  look, instead of just being like, I want to be [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5511.32s)]
*  rich, that's too vague and it's [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5513.32s)]
*  not specific. What do you want? [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5515.32s)]
*  Specifically, [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5517.32s)]
*  what house do you want, what car do you want, [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5519.32s)]
*  what kind of life do you want to live? How much [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5521.32s)]
*  does all that cost? Now reverse engineer, [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5523.32s)]
*  now all of a sudden you don't need a billion. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5525.32s)]
*  You need two mill, or you need 500 [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5527.32s)]
*  grand, or whatever. So like, for me, [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5529.32s)]
*  I do that all the time with myself, where I'm [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5531.32s)]
*  like, do I want more [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5533.32s)]
*  money? Yeah, because I'm ambitious, and I like seeing the [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5535.32s)]
*  numbers go up on a screen, because it's like a video game. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5537.32s)]
*  But realistically, it's like, [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5539.32s)]
*  me and my business manager talk about [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5541.32s)]
*  all the time, it's like the big purchases are out of the way. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5543.32s)]
*  Everyone got a spot. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5545.32s)]
*  Everyone has a car, everyone has a spot. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5547.32s)]
*  So it's like, now I'm just on [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5549.32s)]
*  some, like, bro, I'm just trying to go [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5551.32s)]
*  places and do ill shit. Like, we were just in [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5553.32s)]
*  Marrakesh just because. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5555.32s)]
*  Like, my dad fell off a camel. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5557.32s)]
*  It's awesome. That's a high fall. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5559.32s)]
*  It was on the way down. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5561.32s)]
*  But it's just like, [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5563.32s)]
*  doing shit like that, like, for no [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5565.32s)]
*  other reason than being able to log [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5567.32s)]
*  it in your memory bank. Like, that's [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5569.32s)]
*  to me, that's the only reason why I'm doing this shit. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5571.32s)]
*  A wealth of experiences. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5573.32s)]
*  That's it, bro, because all this shit [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5575.32s)]
*  is just like, it's [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5577.32s)]
*  one big facade that people are just, [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5579.32s)]
*  I feel like, me included, was [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5581.32s)]
*  chasing such, like, [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5583.32s)]
*  approval and validation [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5585.32s)]
*  and, like, travel is for you. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5587.32s)]
*  Travel, travel. Stacking money is for them. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5589.32s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5591.32s)]
*  Because who is it impressing? [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5593.32s)]
*  Right, well, you know who it's impressing? [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5595.32s)]
*  It's impressing the [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5597.32s)]
*  perception of what I think I should be. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5599.32s)]
*  Exactly. But that's in the eyes of whom. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5601.32s)]
*  I should, what, I've made 50 mil, [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5603.32s)]
*  I should have 48. It's like, [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5605.32s)]
*  you could have had 48, but guess what you couldn't [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5607.32s)]
*  have had? Is the trip to there, [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5609.32s)]
*  the trip to there, the trip. And I think about [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5611.32s)]
*  that shit all the time. It's like, [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5613.32s)]
*  someone, you know, I said it on a song, [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5615.32s)]
*  it's like, [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5617.32s)]
*  some like, you may be richer, but have [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5619.32s)]
*  you ever left the country? You know [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5621.32s)]
*  what I'm saying? It's like, so how rich are you? [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5623.32s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, I'm, I [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5625.32s)]
*  feel so rich in [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5627.32s)]
*  experiences. There's that [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5629.32s)]
*  parable. You know what I'm saying? Like, my mom has been [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5631.32s)]
*  no lie, around [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5633.32s)]
*  the world, two, three times. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5635.32s)]
*  Around the world. That's fine. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5637.32s)]
*  Everywhere, documented. Like, she's [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5639.32s)]
*  seen everywhere. And it's like, [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5641.32s)]
*  what else, dog? [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5643.32s)]
*  I'm going to probably bastardize it, but there's that parable about [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5645.32s)]
*  the guy fishing, and then somebody comes up [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5647.32s)]
*  to him, and he's like, what are you doing? Oh, I know, bro, [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5649.32s)]
*  please tell a story for the camera, because it's my favorite trick. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5651.32s)]
*  You can probably tell it to me better than me, so you go. No, you can, because [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5653.32s)]
*  you know. So the guy sees another guy fishing, and he's just like, [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5655.32s)]
*  so what do you do? [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5657.32s)]
*  I'm an investment banker, whatever the fuck he is. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5659.32s)]
*  And the guy's like, oh, I just sit here and fish, and that's, and he's like, [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5661.32s)]
*  what, that's how you make your entire living? He's like, yeah. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5663.32s)]
*  What's wrong with that? And the guy's like, no, man, you need to [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5665.32s)]
*  like, fish, you need to like, sell fish, [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5667.32s)]
*  open a market, then maybe open an online [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5669.32s)]
*  e-commerce thing, then you can try to make money, [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5671.32s)]
*  they can hire employees, and he goes through step after [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5673.32s)]
*  step after step, and then the guy's like, okay, [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5675.32s)]
*  then what happens? And he goes, then you can just sit there and fish. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5677.32s)]
*  And the guy's like, I'm all right now. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5679.32s)]
*  And that's it. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5681.32s)]
*  That's it. It's like, because I've heard that, [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5683.32s)]
*  and it's so true. It's like, bro, [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5685.32s)]
*  I sit at home, and I [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5687.32s)]
*  make music. And money, it's mailbox money. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5689.32s)]
*  I get paid every Friday since I was fucking [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5691.32s)]
*  18. So it's like, [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5693.32s)]
*  this is it. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5695.32s)]
*  All right, guys, we're going to take a break real quick, because [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5697.32s)]

*  What is progress? [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5827.32s)]
*  Progress is [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5829.32s)]
*  perpetual. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5831.32s)]
*  It's forever. How do you define progress? [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5833.32s)]
*  Everything. Well, it's just [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5835.32s)]
*  you know, if you run down the categories, physically [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5837.32s)]
*  I want to be stronger. I want to be [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5839.32s)]
*  healthier. Mentally, I want to be more [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5841.32s)]
*  disciplined. Musically, [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5843.32s)]
*  I want to make something that I love even more than what I did yesterday. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5845.32s)]
*  You know, and it's [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5847.32s)]
*  to me, it's things that are [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5849.32s)]
*  in my control that [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5851.32s)]
*  don't rely [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5853.32s)]
*  on the approval [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5855.32s)]
*  of anyone else but myself. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5857.32s)]
*  And I got into a bad [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5859.32s)]
*  bad space, and not to say that [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5861.32s)]
*  I'm out of it, but I got into a bad space [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5863.32s)]
*  where like, the [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5865.32s)]
*  metric for me was [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5867.32s)]
*  if other people approved what I [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5869.32s)]
*  was doing. And that's [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5871.32s)]
*  a bad place to be. Because you live [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5873.32s)]
*  and die by the booze and the cheers, you know? [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5875.32s)]
*  And yeah, for me, like [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5877.32s)]
*  what excites me now, bro, is just honestly [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5879.32s)]
*  being present in progress. Like [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5881.32s)]
*  waking up at 8 and going to the gym [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5883.32s)]
*  by 9 and by 10 [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5885.32s)]
*  I'm in the studio and by 11 [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5887.32s)]
*  I've made a song and by 12 I'm [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5889.32s)]
*  doing a call about a book I'm putting out. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5891.32s)]
*  And by 1, I'm on [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5893.32s)]
*  the couch with my girl and my two dogs. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5895.32s)]
*  And my mom's swimming in my pool in the backyard. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5897.32s)]
*  And like, [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5899.32s)]
*  that's it. Yeah. Like [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5901.32s)]
*  that to me, [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5903.32s)]
*  that's it. Yeah. I think that's [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5905.32s)]
*  this guy, Naval, I forget his name. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5907.32s)]
*  No, no, no. You were telling me about it. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5909.32s)]
*  He's an Indian dude actually, but he's [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5911.32s)]
*  like an investment guy. He's made billions [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5913.32s)]
*  of dollars. But he had these three like mantras [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5915.32s)]
*  that distills, I think, all of this. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5917.32s)]
*  And I've been thinking about it a lot recently. And he was [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5919.32s)]
*  like the three endogenous indicators [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5921.32s)]
*  of happiness. Everything else can [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5923.32s)]
*  like marginally raise it or lower [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5925.32s)]
*  it, but the three biggest indicators [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5927.32s)]
*  and the words he uses are precise and I really like them. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5929.32s)]
*  He said, a calm mind. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5931.32s)]
*  Wow. Not sharper, not [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5933.32s)]
*  quicker, not doing more shit, but calm. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5935.32s)]
*  Calm mind. Yeah. Fit body, [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5937.32s)]
*  house full of love. He's like, if you get [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5939.32s)]
*  those three things, genuinely everything else [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5941.32s)]
*  is... I love that. I love that. Everything else is kind of [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5943.32s)]
*  like little parameters that can kind of [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5945.32s)]
*  tweak it. But those three things across [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5947.32s)]
*  any culture, any society, any [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5949.32s)]
*  individual is going to be the biggest indicators of happiness. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5951.32s)]
*  I really hope that everyone watching this [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5953.32s)]
*  fucking hears that [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5955.32s)]
*  because that to me, [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5957.32s)]
*  that's the epitome of [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5959.32s)]
*  what people should be chasing. And that's what [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5961.32s)]
*  Santiago is about. That's what the second book is about [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5963.32s)]
*  because all those things you said [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5965.32s)]
*  have nothing to do with anyone else. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5967.32s)]
*  It has everything to do with [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5969.32s)]
*  things that we're in control of. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5971.32s)]
*  And it's just, yeah bro, [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5973.32s)]
*  that's it. That's it. Everything else falls [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5975.32s)]
*  into place. You know, it really does. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5977.32s)]
*  That's what I've noticed. It's like [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5979.32s)]
*  if I'm good mentally, [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5981.32s)]
*  physically, spiritually, [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5983.32s)]
*  whatever, bro. Whatever else happens. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5985.32s)]
*  I don't think therapy's worked on anybody faster than it's worked on you. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5987.32s)]
*  It's actually really remarkable. I think because [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5989.32s)]
*  I needed it and I wanted it so bad. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5991.32s)]
*  And I committed to it [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5993.32s)]
*  because I really, for years, [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5995.32s)]
*  and I would trickle it in songs like [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5997.32s)]
*  I should probably get a therapist. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=5999.32s)]
*  Five years later, still no therapist. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6001.32s)]
*  What are we doing? [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6003.32s)]
*  But yeah, I really [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6005.32s)]
*  did want help. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6007.32s)]
*  It's so much deeper than just [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6009.32s)]
*  the connotation of therapy. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6011.32s)]
*  It's really like a spiritual mentor. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6013.32s)]
*  Because the guy I talk to, [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6015.32s)]
*  he's not even a licensed therapist. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6017.32s)]
*  He's just a fucking guru. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6019.32s)]
*  He's a wise dude. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6021.32s)]
*  Yeah, and it's just, [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6023.32s)]
*  I don't know man, have it like, [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6025.32s)]
*  not to get cliché, but being [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6027.32s)]
*  men, it's tough to [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6029.32s)]
*  feel, one, comfortable [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6031.32s)]
*  being vulnerable with things you're struggling [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6033.32s)]
*  with, two, to even have somebody [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6035.32s)]
*  that you can talk to because to your [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6037.32s)]
*  parents, that might feel like [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6039.32s)]
*  they're going to feel guilty [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6041.32s)]
*  because somehow they'll make it about them. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6043.32s)]
*  To your friends, they're like [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6045.32s)]
*  I don't fucking know. But to like, just get over it. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6047.32s)]
*  And I got my own shit going on. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6049.32s)]
*  You're doing better than me, how can I help? [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6051.32s)]
*  Have you tried getting over it? [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6053.32s)]
*  Just walk it over. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6055.32s)]
*  What did you say in another podcast [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6057.32s)]
*  you said the measure of a man is how far he can [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6059.32s)]
*  So that's something that my mentor told me. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6061.32s)]
*  He said, you know, society measures a man by [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6063.32s)]
*  how much can you carry, [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6065.32s)]
*  how far can you carry it, [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6067.32s)]
*  and how alone can you carry it. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6069.32s)]
*  And it's so real. And I think [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6071.32s)]
*  just subconsciously, that's kind of how men [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6073.32s)]
*  move throughout society. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6075.32s)]
*  Is, you know, [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6077.32s)]
*  not to get fake deep, but when [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6079.32s)]
*  people ask me, how are you doing, it's like [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6081.32s)]
*  can't complain. But when you really read into that [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6083.32s)]
*  it's like, can't complain. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6085.32s)]
*  I can't. I'm in a position where I can't. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6087.32s)]
*  You can't. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6089.32s)]
*  Because we [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6091.32s)]
*  have not allowed ourselves [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6093.32s)]
*  the space to [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6095.32s)]
*  even give ourselves empathy. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6097.32s)]
*  Because we don't feel like it's a safe [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6099.32s)]
*  space with other men. To be like, [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6101.32s)]
*  you know what, I'm going through something right now. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6103.32s)]
*  We also [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6105.32s)]
*  don't want to put that on the people we love, too. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6107.32s)]
*  Yeah, well, because we're men [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6109.32s)]
*  and we gotta shoulder it [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6111.32s)]
*  and fucking [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6113.32s)]
*  brush the dirt off and move forward. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6115.32s)]
*  You don't want your girl to worry. You don't want your mom to worry. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6117.32s)]
*  You don't want all the people who rely on you to worry. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6119.32s)]
*  You want them to know that they're going to be good, and they're good when you're good. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6121.32s)]
*  So you're like, alright, I gotta hold this. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6123.32s)]
*  And then you meet somebody you can talk to about it, [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6125.32s)]
*  and you're like, oh, it feels great to talk to [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6127.32s)]
*  you about it, because these people are all [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6129.32s)]
*  going to be safe, but I get this off my chest. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6131.32s)]
*  And there's no judgment from there. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6133.32s)]
*  And what I learned through talking [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6135.32s)]
*  with him is when you [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6137.32s)]
*  resist, resisting [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6139.32s)]
*  insecurities leads to self-implosion. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6141.32s)]
*  And that [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6143.32s)]
*  to me was so true. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6145.32s)]
*  Whether it was interviews [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6147.32s)]
*  or meetings or just in general, [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6149.32s)]
*  it's like me [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6151.32s)]
*  resisting the feeling of, you know what, I'm nervous. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6153.32s)]
*  I was nervous coming on here. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6155.32s)]
*  And [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6157.32s)]
*  if I would have tried to like overcompensate [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6159.32s)]
*  that, that would have led to maybe [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6161.32s)]
*  really like self-destructive [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6163.32s)]
*  like outburst, [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6165.32s)]
*  you know, or just in general, [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6167.32s)]
*  not on camera. And it's like [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6169.32s)]
*  when you [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6171.32s)]
*  resist what you're actually feeling, [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6173.32s)]
*  which is what men do, it's what we've been trained to do, [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6175.32s)]
*  because you push down, push down, [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6177.32s)]
*  it's going to come out sideways at some point. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6179.32s)]
*  At a time when you don't want it to come out. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6181.32s)]
*  What's that quote? [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6183.32s)]
*  Everything you want [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6185.32s)]
*  is through the door [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6187.32s)]
*  you wish not to enter the most [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6189.32s)]
*  or something. There's this quote about like [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6191.32s)]
*  everything you desire is through the thing [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6193.32s)]
*  that you're most. On the other side of what you fear the most. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6195.32s)]
*  On the other side of what you fear the most. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6197.32s)]
*  And it is true. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6199.32s)]
*  And also like you get into a place of comfort [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6201.32s)]
*  which is like, is privilege, [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6203.32s)]
*  but it can also be a prison. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6205.32s)]
*  You don't have to do an interview. You don't have [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6207.32s)]
*  to do anything you don't want anymore. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6209.32s)]
*  And now you're in the position where you can avoid those things [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6211.32s)]
*  you fear, but what is on the other side of those [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6213.32s)]
*  things you fear is exactly what you want. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6215.32s)]
*  I know, and you know what? For me, this is like [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6217.32s)]
*  a thing I've like [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6219.32s)]
*  set as a goal, is like the year of just [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6221.32s)]
*  doing hard shit, because [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6223.32s)]
*  like you said, [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6225.32s)]
*  I don't have to talk to anyone ever again. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6227.32s)]
*  And you're good. And I'm fine, but it's like, guess what? [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6229.32s)]
*  But I want more, and I'm ambitious, [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6231.32s)]
*  and I want to express [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6233.32s)]
*  myself in different mediums than just music. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6235.32s)]
*  So guess what that means? [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6237.32s)]
*  You gotta do the podcast. You should do the podcast. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6239.32s)]
*  You fuck with Shultz. You like his brand. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6241.32s)]
*  It's a good place for you to express yourself and be honest. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6243.32s)]
*  But yeah, it's confronting, [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6245.32s)]
*  because now you gotta like [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6247.32s)]
*  be yourself, and people are watching. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6249.32s)]
*  You're putting yourself out there for judgment. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6251.32s)]
*  You can't control it as much. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6253.32s)]
*  So it's scary, and like you said, [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6255.32s)]
*  because I'm good, I can just be like, [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6257.32s)]
*  what? I'm at the house. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6259.32s)]
*  I was just in Saudi, the Americas. I could have just gone home. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6261.32s)]
*  You know? Like I miss my [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6263.32s)]
*  dogs. I miss my best. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6265.32s)]
*  But it's like, nah bro. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6267.32s)]
*  I have to do the hard shit. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6269.32s)]
*  And then there's a joy that comes from that. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6271.32s)]
*  There's also like a fulfillment [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6273.32s)]
*  of purpose that comes from it. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6275.32s)]
*  Because you're like, oh shit. I was scared, and then I did it. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6277.32s)]
*  It's weird, like [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6279.32s)]
*  because that is, I guess, [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6281.32s)]
*  on the other side of fear is strength. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6283.32s)]
*  So that is the thing, like when it comes to like [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6285.32s)]
*  money or stacking, whatever these things are, [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6287.32s)]
*  I think that like, [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6289.32s)]
*  I have no aspiration to be a billionaire. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6291.32s)]
*  The sound of it is like, [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6293.32s)]
*  okay, if it's cool, I don't give a fuck. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6295.32s)]
*  I just don't care. It doesn't mean anything to me. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6297.32s)]
*  But I do have an aspiration of having [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6299.32s)]
*  enough money where every decision I make [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6301.32s)]
*  is because I want to make it. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6303.32s)]
*  Right? Not because I have to. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6305.32s)]
*  Right now we're privileged enough, like we're the luckiest [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6307.32s)]
*  people in the fucking face of the universe. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6309.32s)]
*  We get to do shit that is so much fun for a living. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6311.32s)]
*  Like this is a joke. It's even a job. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6313.32s)]
*  Right. It's crazy. Look what we're doing. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6315.32s)]
*  It's a joke. This is insane. It's absurd. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6317.32s)]
*  We're in a random building in New York. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6319.32s)]
*  We set up cameras to make it seem like we're doing something. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6321.32s)]
*  There's fake bricks here. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6323.32s)]
*  Yeah. They're not even real. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6325.32s)]
*  So like... No, it's insane. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6327.32s)]
*  Dope combos, though. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6329.32s)]
*  But see, that's really what it's about. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6331.32s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6333.32s)]
*  But one of the things is like... [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6335.32s)]
*  So we're very fortunate that through [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6337.32s)]
*  stand-up and all these different things, through music, [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6339.32s)]
*  for you, you've been able to [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6341.32s)]
*  do a thing that you truly love to make a living. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6343.32s)]
*  There is another level which [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6345.32s)]
*  you might be at. I don't want to count your pockets, [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6347.32s)]
*  where it's like you actually don't have [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6349.32s)]
*  to do anything anymore. Your family's good. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6351.32s)]
*  You're good. And everything you do [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6353.32s)]
*  is because you want to do it. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6355.32s)]
*  Now, what you just described to me, [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6357.32s)]
*  I didn't even foresee, which is [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6359.32s)]
*  when you don't have to do anything, [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6361.32s)]
*  you will [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6363.32s)]
*  have greater hesitation [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6365.32s)]
*  with the things that you fear to do. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6367.32s)]
*  Yes. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6369.32s)]
*  I didn't even think about that. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6371.32s)]
*  Well, because for a long time, I've been at [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6373.32s)]
*  where you're talking about where it's like, I don't have to do any of this. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6375.32s)]
*  And you're good. Because I've had the mailbox... [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6377.32s)]
*  I've been getting paid every Friday. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6379.32s)]
*  You're going to be fine. So it's like... [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6381.32s)]
*  I know I've been financially [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6383.32s)]
*  secure for a long time. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6385.32s)]
*  And so now, like you just said, [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6387.32s)]
*  I've never heard it like that. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6389.32s)]
*  Now it makes you really analyze [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6391.32s)]
*  the things you don't want to do because you're like, wait a second. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6393.32s)]
*  Because before you've got to do that. I didn't have to do this. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6395.32s)]
*  You've got to do that uncomfortable interview because you're like, [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6397.32s)]
*  I want to push this album. I want people to see my work. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6399.32s)]
*  I put a lot of effort into this. So I'm going to put myself [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6401.32s)]
*  in this vulnerable situation because [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6403.32s)]
*  there is upside and I have to risk [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6405.32s)]
*  that downside for that upside. You can't hide from fear [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6407.32s)]
*  if you're not rich. Right. And that makes me [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6409.32s)]
*  think of the Omega artists that are... [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6411.32s)]
*  They do the mysterious thing. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6413.32s)]
*  And I'm wondering... Are you mysterious? [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6415.32s)]
*  Or are you just a little bit afraid? Like the Kendricks [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6417.32s)]
*  or the Travis's that you never see them. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6419.32s)]
*  They're just good. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6421.32s)]
*  They're just like... They're fine. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6423.32s)]
*  Maybe they're afraid. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6425.32s)]
*  But maybe they're afraid. But it's like... [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6427.32s)]
*  I know for me, it's just kind of like [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6429.32s)]
*  I don't have to do [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6431.32s)]
*  these things. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6433.32s)]
*  But I want to do them because [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6435.32s)]
*  at this point, I'm just being driven by the fact [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6437.32s)]
*  that I'm scared to do them. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6439.32s)]
*  You know what I mean? But that's because your goal is personal growth. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6441.32s)]
*  If your goal is money, then you're like [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6443.32s)]
*  I'm not going to do this because I'm going to make more music. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6445.32s)]
*  Exactly. And that's fucking... [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6447.32s)]
*  How do you gauge how much you show the world? [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6449.32s)]
*  Because you're very vulnerable in your music [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6451.32s)]
*  but then social media [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6453.32s)]
*  just surface level stuff... I don't know. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6455.32s)]
*  Even right now, I have nothing to push. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6457.32s)]
*  We can make up things. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6459.32s)]
*  I have a song coming out in two days. I don't give a fuck [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6461.32s)]
*  if we... We don't have to talk about [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6463.32s)]
*  any of that. I got a hair care... [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6465.32s)]
*  I don't give a shit. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6467.32s)]
*  This is clever right here. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6469.32s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6471.32s)]
*  Lock that up. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6473.32s)]
*  I don't even have anything to do. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6475.32s)]
*  Santiago is out by the way. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6477.32s)]
*  No, but truthfully, it's like [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6479.32s)]
*  I just like... [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6481.32s)]
*  I genuinely wanted to come on here [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6483.32s)]
*  as an exercise [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6485.32s)]
*  in like, do the hard shit. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6487.32s)]
*  It has nothing to do with [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6489.32s)]
*  any of that because I've learned [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6491.32s)]
*  that all of these [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6493.32s)]
*  extraterrestrial things [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6495.32s)]
*  don't sell your music. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6497.32s)]
*  I'll never forget. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6499.32s)]
*  This is no shot of Tyga. I love Tyga. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6501.32s)]
*  I remember 10, 12 years ago... [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6503.32s)]
*  I don't know when the fuck it was. Kim Kardashian [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6505.32s)]
*  posted a Tyga mixtape. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6507.32s)]
*  We're on the come up, so we're studying [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6509.32s)]
*  everything and we're like, Dan, [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6511.32s)]
*  Kim posting the mixtape didn't even [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6513.32s)]
*  really matter. It didn't move [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6515.32s)]
*  the needle. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6517.32s)]
*  Certain things you just remember on your come up [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6519.32s)]
*  and so forever we're just like, yeah, it just doesn't matter. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6521.32s)]
*  Kanye right now [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6523.32s)]
*  could post me on his Instagram like, go listen to [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6525.32s)]
*  Santiago. It's not going to like... [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6527.32s)]
*  For 24 hours it'll be like, whoa. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6529.32s)]
*  No, but if he posted with a picture next [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6531.32s)]
*  to that mill factory he got [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6533.32s)]
*  walking around with. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6535.32s)]
*  It's just like... [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6537.32s)]
*  I'm telling you, [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6539.32s)]
*  the internet's so fast, it doesn't matter. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6541.32s)]
*  The only shit that matters is like [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6545.32s)]
*  real, actual, human, [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6547.32s)]
*  consistent connection. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6549.32s)]
*  And so for me, yeah, it's like I don't have to do [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6551.32s)]
*  any of this. I don't care about promoting [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6553.32s)]
*  anything because I'm not [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6555.32s)]
*  entitled to your platform to promote [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6557.32s)]
*  my shit. So I know [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6559.32s)]
*  I have my platform, my fans know what's going on, [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6561.32s)]
*  I got a community, y'all know what's up, cool. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6563.32s)]
*  I want to come out here because I fuck with you. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6565.32s)]
*  I want to talk to y'all [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6567.32s)]
*  and like I said, it's an exercise [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6569.32s)]
*  and like, bro, do [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6571.32s)]
*  the hard shit. This is like training my brain [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6573.32s)]
*  to do a cold plunge. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6575.32s)]
*  See what I'm saying? This is the cold plunge. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6577.32s)]
*  Like this is the cold plunge. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6579.32s)]
*  Selfish follow-up. You talked about [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6581.32s)]
*  all I want is growth and even in your music, all you [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6583.32s)]
*  want is growth. I was listening to a podcast [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6585.32s)]
*  where he talks, this guy works with like high [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6587.32s)]
*  level athletes, investors, whatever [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6589.32s)]
*  and he talks about the people who excel, the [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6591.32s)]
*  Tiger Woods types. They don't [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6593.32s)]
*  perform for ego reasons. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6595.32s)]
*  They don't do what they do for ego reasons. A lot of us do [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6597.32s)]
*  and that's why like embarrassment, like [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6599.32s)]
*  bombing on stage as a comedian is so fucking [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6601.32s)]
*  embarrassing. Having an album flop maybe. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6603.32s)]
*  He talks about basketball players a lot of times. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6605.32s)]
*  Like they don't want to miss free throws. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6607.32s)]
*  It's just embarrassment and that really hinders your growth [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6609.32s)]
*  if you're doing it for your ego. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6611.32s)]
*  Because the ego is like, well, I don't want to get embarrassed. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6613.32s)]
*  The people who are the best of the [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6615.32s)]
*  best are in it just for mastery [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6617.32s)]
*  and that's all they care about. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6619.32s)]
*  How do you, based on what I've researched [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6621.32s)]
*  from you, listened to with Santiago, [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6623.32s)]
*  you were ego initially [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6625.32s)]
*  and now it's mastery. How do you [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6627.32s)]
*  uncouple yours? Because I'm in the process of trying to let go. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6629.32s)]
*  It's not that black and white. It's still a little bit [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6631.32s)]
*  of both. But I'm in the [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6633.32s)]
*  process of shifting [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6635.32s)]
*  the trophy from [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6637.32s)]
*  ego to self mastery. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6639.32s)]
*  That's part of the work that I've been doing [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6641.32s)]
*  and that's what Santiago is about. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6643.32s)]
*  Which is why the album ends on me singing [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6645.32s)]
*  It Was You All Along. I love that. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6647.32s)]
*  It's because it's like everything you've been chasing [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6649.32s)]
*  is you. You've been chasing [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6651.32s)]
*  yourself. You're chasing your tail this whole time. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6653.32s)]
*  And [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6655.32s)]
*  self mastery is [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6657.32s)]
*  in my opinion, it's the [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6659.32s)]
*  only thing worth going after [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6661.32s)]
*  because it's a game we can all play. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6663.32s)]
*  It's a trophy we can all win. And it doesn't [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6665.32s)]
*  matter who else is playing. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6667.32s)]
*  We can all win it. It's a weird thing though. Sometimes [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6669.32s)]
*  like having [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6671.32s)]
*  money allows [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6673.32s)]
*  you to reflect long enough to [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6675.32s)]
*  realize what you truly wanted the whole time. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6677.32s)]
*  People who don't have that [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6679.32s)]
*  they're trying to... They think [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6681.32s)]
*  that money's the answer. Because in the [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6683.32s)]
*  moment, it is the answer to their rent. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6685.32s)]
*  It's the answer to their food, taking care of their family. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6687.32s)]
*  It's the three basic [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6689.32s)]
*  things. It's like shelter, food, water. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6691.32s)]
*  I can't think past that till [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6693.32s)]
*  those are covered. But it's like the Jim Carrey [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6695.32s)]
*  commencement speech he gave. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6697.32s)]
*  It's not [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6699.32s)]
*  this verbatim, but it's like I wish [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6701.32s)]
*  everyone was rich and famous so they could figure out [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6703.32s)]
*  what they really want. He's right though. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6705.32s)]
*  It's the truth. It's like everyone... And I don't [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6707.32s)]
*  blame people because I get it. Because like you said [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6709.32s)]
*  it's like we don't have shelter, food, or water. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6711.32s)]
*  But it's like I wish [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6713.32s)]
*  everyone could get their money and get their [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6715.32s)]
*  shit straight. Then you'd really see what you [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6717.32s)]
*  actually want. It's important to position it in that way [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6719.32s)]
*  because I know that there's probably people who watch [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6721.32s)]
*  and listen to hear... They hear people say these [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6723.32s)]
*  things and they're just like, man, shut the fuck up. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6725.32s)]
*  You got everything. And it seems almost like [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6727.32s)]
*  condescending when [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6729.32s)]
*  it's said. But [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6731.32s)]
*  there is a lot of game in there. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6733.32s)]
*  There's so much pro. And I like how [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6735.32s)]
*  Jim said it where it's just like, I [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6737.32s)]
*  can't wait for you to have all [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6739.32s)]
*  that money so that you start tapping [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6741.32s)]
*  away at the game. And what's so funny is we talk about [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6743.32s)]
*  Jim Carrey as like a manifestation [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6745.32s)]
*  example where he wrote a $20 million [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6747.32s)]
*  check to himself when he was broke. And then he [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6749.32s)]
*  got paid $20 million for I think Ace Ventura [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6751.32s)]
*  too. But nobody leaves out the part [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6753.32s)]
*  where he goes, you know, he still wasn't happy after that. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6755.32s)]
*  That's a really interesting [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6757.32s)]
*  thing. Well, because it's like [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6759.32s)]
*  to his point, it's like [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6761.32s)]
*  you realize what you actually want. Yeah, what makes [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6763.32s)]
*  you happy? Is it like, is it creating [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6765.32s)]
*  things you're proud of? [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6767.32s)]
*  Or is it the people clapping? Well, the reality for [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6769.32s)]
*  me, right, to what you were saying with Santiago, [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6771.32s)]
*  it's like I got [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6773.32s)]
*  you know, plaques and money and all this shit. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6775.32s)]
*  And there was [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6777.32s)]
*  a hole still. And the hole [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6779.32s)]
*  was the fact that I didn't [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6781.32s)]
*  approve of myself. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6783.32s)]
*  So it didn't matter that the plaques were [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6785.32s)]
*  approval. There were signs of validation. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6787.32s)]
*  All these symbols of success. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6789.32s)]
*  Sold out shows, plaques, [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6791.32s)]
*  money. They're just symbols of success. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6793.32s)]
*  Real success, it's an inside [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6795.32s)]
*  job. It's do you approve [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6797.32s)]
*  of yourself? And I did it. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6799.32s)]
*  And the reason why is [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6801.32s)]
*  because at a very, very young age, [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6803.32s)]
*  like most boys, [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6805.32s)]
*  your metric of [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6807.32s)]
*  success is your dad's approval. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6809.32s)]
*  And for me, my dad's standard [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6811.32s)]
*  was perfection. An unmeetable [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6813.32s)]
*  goal. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6815.32s)]
*  And so, therefore, I was [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6817.32s)]
*  never quite the standard. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6819.32s)]
*  And as you grow up, [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6821.32s)]
*  my dad's voice became my own voice. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6823.32s)]
*  And so his metric became my metric, [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6825.32s)]
*  which ended up being, I'm not good enough [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6827.32s)]
*  for myself no matter what I do. Because it's [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6829.32s)]
*  not perfect. And so, [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6831.32s)]
*  And it's a great motivator. It's a great motivator. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6833.32s)]
*  Oh, because you know why? Because guess [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6835.32s)]
*  what? Yeah, you went platinum. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6837.32s)]
*  Why didn't you go two? [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6839.32s)]
*  And so you'll keep succeeding. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6841.32s)]
*  And from the outside looking in, it's like, [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6843.32s)]
*  damn Russ, your work ethic's crazy. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6845.32s)]
*  It's like, if only you knew what was [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6847.32s)]
*  driving the car. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6849.32s)]
*  Like, this [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6851.32s)]
*  is not a good energy driving the car. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6853.32s)]
*  What did you tell your manager? This is [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6855.32s)]
*  my shadow. This is my shame [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6857.32s)]
*  self. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6859.32s)]
*  Behind the driver's seat, [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6861.32s)]
*  I'm just like the little boy in the passenger [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6863.32s)]
*  seat, and the shame is driving like, [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6865.32s)]
*  you fucking loser. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6867.32s)]
*  I gotta get us all the way to double, because you [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6869.32s)]
*  couldn't. Right. So what do you do [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6871.32s)]
*  to make that shift? Like, are there [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6873.32s)]
*  active steps you're taking? Writing affirmations? [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6875.32s)]
*  Yeah, the active steps [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6877.32s)]
*  are, first of all, [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6879.32s)]
*  and I think this goes overlooked, [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6881.32s)]
*  step one is awareness. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6883.32s)]
*  Just even being aware that [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6885.32s)]
*  you're doing what you're doing. I just [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6887.32s)]
*  wasn't even aware that that's what I was doing, that that [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6889.32s)]
*  was my process. So [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6891.32s)]
*  like, step one is awareness. Step two [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6893.32s)]
*  is starting to, yeah, [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6895.32s)]
*  to modify the process. It's to sort of, [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6897.32s)]
*  it's to interfere [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6899.32s)]
*  the negative self-talk. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6901.32s)]
*  It's to catch it. So when [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6903.32s)]
*  that shame and that shadow pops up [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6905.32s)]
*  and is like, not good enough, [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6907.32s)]
*  you gotta tell yourself [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6909.32s)]
*  and tell that version of yourself, yo, chill. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6911.32s)]
*  Like, I hear you, [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6913.32s)]
*  I know you just want the best, [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6915.32s)]
*  but we're not doing it like that anymore. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6917.32s)]
*  But the first step is awareness, and a lot of [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6919.32s)]
*  people, me included, just not even aware that I [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6921.32s)]
*  was like, moving like that. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6923.32s)]
*  I thought it was all [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6925.32s)]
*  positive. I'm looking at my life, I'm like, [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6927.32s)]
*  plaques, money, [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6929.32s)]
*  I'm doing pretty good, [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6931.32s)]
*  you know, everything I'm doing must be [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6933.32s)]
*  right. Especially when no one else [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6935.32s)]
*  around you is at the level [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6937.32s)]
*  you're at, you feel like you [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6939.32s)]
*  must be doing something. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6941.32s)]
*  They're like the average person, you know what I mean? [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6943.32s)]
*  They all think you're doing something right. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6945.32s)]
*  And so they're not gonna tell you [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6947.32s)]
*  they don't wanna help you. How could they help you? [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6949.32s)]
*  Well, they wanna help you, but [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6951.32s)]
*  they don't know how, because it's like [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6953.32s)]
*  it's working. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6955.32s)]
*  So I don't know, bro, it's like, shit. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6957.32s)]
*  Keep doing what you're doing. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6959.32s)]
*  And keep in mind success. You know how many times you [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6961.32s)]
*  daft somebody up as a successful person [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6963.32s)]
*  and they just say, keep doing [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6965.32s)]
*  what you're doing? It's like, [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6967.32s)]
*  nah. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6969.32s)]
*  This is not sustainable. I'm still angry. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6971.32s)]
*  No, it's not sustainable, because at some point you burn [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6973.32s)]
*  out, you know what I mean? [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6975.32s)]
*  I talk about it in the book and I talk about it with [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6977.32s)]
*  my mentor, but it's like dark motivation versus [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6979.32s)]
*  light motivation. And I was just [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6981.32s)]
*  driven by dark motivation, which is like [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6983.32s)]
*  fear based. Like I need to prove to [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6985.32s)]
*  everyone that I'm really who [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6987.32s)]
*  I am and who I think I am. And it's all [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6989.32s)]
*  this like, it's very combative [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6991.32s)]
*  and it's making enemies out of people and [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6993.32s)]
*  entities that don't even know they're enemies. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6995.32s)]
*  It's not even real. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6997.32s)]
*  I've said it on here before and it's like, I think [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=6999.32s)]
*  we're just doing it wrong here. This [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7001.32s)]
*  American capitalist chasing [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7003.32s)]
*  after it. You go to these older [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7005.32s)]
*  societies in Europe [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7007.32s)]
*  where it's like, they get it. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7009.32s)]
*  They get it. They had the calm mind, [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7011.32s)]
*  the love in the home, [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7013.32s)]
*  the fit body. They got it [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7015.32s)]
*  already. There's less ambition for sure. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7017.32s)]
*  There is less ambition. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7019.32s)]
*  And an American will go over there and be like, [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7021.32s)]
*  how are you happy? [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7023.32s)]
*  You're a loser. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7025.32s)]
*  Look at your life. Broky! [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7027.32s)]
*  It's like what? I lived in Spain [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7029.32s)]
*  for a year and I had, [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7031.32s)]
*  I was living on like 10 euros a day. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7033.32s)]
*  Five of those euros were spent to get [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7035.32s)]
*  into a club and I got a beer with the entrance [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7037.32s)]
*  fee. Beautiful. So the other five [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7039.32s)]
*  were like putting together the meal. We were cooking [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7041.32s)]
*  fucking the Spanish tortilla. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7043.32s)]
*  It was just great. We were living broke together. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7045.32s)]
*  We were playing basketball and it was awesome. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7047.32s)]
*  And I remember having this moment there where I was like, [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7049.32s)]
*  man, I could do this forever. And I [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7051.32s)]
*  had to stop myself and be like, hold on. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7053.32s)]
*  No, you gotta go achieve things. You gotta go do things. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7055.32s)]
*  You gotta go back and finish college. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7057.32s)]
*  And I'm glad that I did. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7059.32s)]
*  But to what you were saying was, [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7061.32s)]
*  I was at such peace with my [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7063.32s)]
*  life and with my friends and doing the things [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7065.32s)]
*  I wanted to do. It was something that I hadn't experienced [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7067.32s)]
*  in the same level back home. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7069.32s)]
*  And you were fishing already. That's what I'm saying. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7071.32s)]
*  I was fishing. But I'm glad [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7073.32s)]
*  that I was able to go and chase [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7075.32s)]
*  success here. Because I think sometimes [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7077.32s)]
*  the sacrifice [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7079.32s)]
*  that you make when you have a society or a culture [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7081.32s)]
*  that's built around that, which [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7083.32s)]
*  sometimes they could scrutinize ambition [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7085.32s)]
*  and like [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7087.32s)]
*  the people that aren't cool [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7089.32s)]
*  just fishing, they want to go fish [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7091.32s)]
*  in the deep sea. The people that just fish and [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7093.32s)]
*  start going, why? You think you're better than us? [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7095.32s)]
*  What do you need that for? Yeah, you know. And sometimes [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7097.32s)]
*  you don't think you're better than them. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7099.32s)]
*  You just really want to see what fishing in the deep sea [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7101.32s)]
*  is about. You just want to challenge yourself. For you. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7103.32s)]
*  Yeah, for you. And if you're doing it for you, I do think [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7105.32s)]
*  that that is valuable. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7107.32s)]
*  Absolutely. I think [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7109.32s)]
*  everything should be for you. That's the whole key. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7111.32s)]
*  Figuring out [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7113.32s)]
*  what that is. That's the being in [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7115.32s)]
*  pursuit of progress. It's like, I've already caught the fish [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7117.32s)]
*  in this spot. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7119.32s)]
*  Can I catch a fish in the ocean? [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7121.32s)]
*  That's why for me it's like [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7123.32s)]
*  sometimes people get confused when [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7125.32s)]
*  they're like, well, why do you still want a Grammy? [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7127.32s)]
*  Well, because I don't have one. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7129.32s)]
*  And that's progress. I don't [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7131.32s)]
*  want it so that y'all clap for me. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7133.32s)]
*  I just want it to see progress. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7135.32s)]
*  That's it. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7137.32s)]
*  But you see that as a form of validation? [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7139.32s)]
*  No, no, no, no. It's not validation. It's more so [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7141.32s)]
*  it's [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7143.32s)]
*  it's a confirmation that progress [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7145.32s)]
*  has been had in a certain category. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7147.32s)]
*  It's less about, see now, the intention [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7149.32s)]
*  is everything. If the intention [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7151.32s)]
*  behind it is, you know what, [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7153.32s)]
*  I want a Grammy because if I [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7155.32s)]
*  get a Grammy, y'all will fuck with me more. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7157.32s)]
*  Now there's a [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7159.32s)]
*  negative intention around it. You're going to get the Grammy [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7161.32s)]
*  and still be miserable because you don't improve yourself. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7163.32s)]
*  If I can poke a hole, it is still progress [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7165.32s)]
*  that is decided. It's other people deciding [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7167.32s)]
*  you've made progress. It's progress that's completely [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7169.32s)]
*  externally validated. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7171.32s)]
*  Externally validated specifically. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7173.32s)]
*  Yes. And you know what's so funny about that is when [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7175.32s)]
*  Santiago came out and [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7177.32s)]
*  Billboard took away sales and I was so [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7179.32s)]
*  fucking pissed. Wait, why'd they do that? [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7181.32s)]
*  Complete horse shit. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7183.32s)]
*  Because you're not allowed to, this is [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7185.32s)]
*  Billboard's rules, not even allowed. You can look it up on [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7187.32s)]
*  the internet. Billboard says [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7189.32s)]
*  you are not allowed to incentivize [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7191.32s)]
*  fans to buy albums. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7193.32s)]
*  You know what that is? What do you mean? Marketing. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7195.32s)]
*  Incentivize fans to buy albums is [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7199.32s)]
*  marketing. It's literally in the rules. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7201.32s)]
*  Luminate is the [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7203.32s)]
*  company that verifies the sales for Billboard. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7205.32s)]
*  They're owned by the same company. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7207.32s)]
*  So I'm like, okay, that's insane because [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7209.32s)]
*  you're allowing fake streams. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7211.32s)]
*  And merch bundles. How is a merch bundle not [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7213.32s)]
*  incentivized? What was your incentive? [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7215.32s)]
*  My incentive was if you [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7217.32s)]
*  buy a fucking album, [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7219.32s)]
*  you maybe get invited to a desert [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7221.32s)]
*  concert. You're not allowed to listen. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7223.32s)]
*  Whatever it is. That's crazy. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7225.32s)]
*  That's incredible marketing. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7227.32s)]
*  Why am I not allowed to market? [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7229.32s)]
*  A bundle is a tangible thing that every single person does. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7231.32s)]
*  A bundle is incentivizing fans to buy an album. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7233.32s)]
*  So they took away sales, [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7235.32s)]
*  real sales, while allowing fake sales. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7237.32s)]
*  And I remember hitting my mentor, I'm like, [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7239.32s)]
*  bro, this is such bullshit. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7241.32s)]
*  They're taking away my progress. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7243.32s)]
*  And he said, no, [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7245.32s)]
*  they're taking away the external [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7247.32s)]
*  knowing of your progress. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7249.32s)]
*  They're taking away your internal knowing of your progress. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7251.32s)]
*  And I thought that was really profound. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7253.32s)]
*  And to your point with the Grammys, he's like, yeah, [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7255.32s)]
*  that is out of my control, which is why I can't [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7257.32s)]
*  place too much, I can't personalize [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7259.32s)]
*  it too much. Fair enough. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7261.32s)]
*  But there is something valuable [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7263.32s)]
*  about having a mountain decline. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7265.32s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? Yeah, it's ambition, purpose. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7267.32s)]
*  Yeah, so it's like, it's a good mountain decline, [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7269.32s)]
*  but depersonalize it. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7271.32s)]
*  So just to clarify. I won't take it personally [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7273.32s)]
*  when this doesn't get nominated for a Grammys [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7275.32s)]
*  or whatever. Is it an absolutely [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7277.32s)]
*  okay mountain to have if you just want to see progress? [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7279.32s)]
*  Sure. But don't personalize [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7281.32s)]
*  it to the point that, well, [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7283.32s)]
*  if I don't get it, then I'm a [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7285.32s)]
*  failure. So just to clarify, [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7287.32s)]
*  the album itself [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7289.32s)]
*  represents the progress. Correct. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7291.32s)]
*  Not the sales, [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7293.32s)]
*  not whether it's for them. The fact that I made it. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7295.32s)]
*  The fact that you made it. The fact that I made it. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7297.32s)]
*  That's the thing that I always tell people, it's like, [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7299.32s)]
*  certain [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7301.32s)]
*  songs, it's like, bro, [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7303.32s)]
*  this song was already a success before it went out. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7305.32s)]
*  Because I made what I wanted to make. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7307.32s)]
*  I already won. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7309.32s)]
*  But when the thing that you want to make [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7311.32s)]
*  receives an amazing [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7313.32s)]
*  response, it's a [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7315.32s)]
*  euphoric feeling. Oh, yeah, because [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7317.32s)]
*  you feel like your artistic [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7319.32s)]
*  integrity is intact and the people [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7321.32s)]
*  are appreciating you for your most authentic [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7323.32s)]
*  self. That's the fucking... No, it's incredible. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7325.32s)]
*  It's incredible. What song on this album [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7327.32s)]
*  was your biggest win without, just by putting [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7329.32s)]
*  it out? I Love You Boy. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7331.32s)]
*  I remember you saying that. That was really hard to write. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7333.32s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that was the one where, you know, the whole album [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7335.32s)]
*  was me doing sessions with [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7337.32s)]
*  my mentor and him [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7339.32s)]
*  giving me exercises, because [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7341.32s)]
*  you know, I won't even lie, the first session [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7343.32s)]
*  we did, I felt bad. Because I was like, [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7345.32s)]
*  man, the whole time you're talking, and I told him that, I said, [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7347.32s)]
*  the whole time you're talking, I'm thinking of songs. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7349.32s)]
*  I can write about this shit. Yeah. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7351.32s)]
*  And I felt bad. I felt like I was almost using [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7353.32s)]
*  the situation. And he was [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7355.32s)]
*  like, no, no, no, no, no. Allow the [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7357.32s)]
*  creative side of you to come along for the journey. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7359.32s)]
*  You know, and I learned that the [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7361.32s)]
*  creative part of me is sort of the part of me that [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7363.32s)]
*  tries to make sense of all the other parts of me. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7365.32s)]
*  So he would give me these exercises, [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7367.32s)]
*  and he would never say write a song. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7369.32s)]
*  He would just journal. He said, [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7371.32s)]
*  you can journal in the form of a journal, [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7373.32s)]
*  a poem, a song, lyrics, whatever [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7375.32s)]
*  you want. Of course, naturally, I'm always going to [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7377.32s)]
*  revert to the medium that you do, is most [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7379.32s)]
*  familiar with. So [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7381.32s)]
*  so many times we would do a session on Zoom, [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7383.32s)]
*  and I would do all the sessions in the studio [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7385.32s)]
*  right next to the mic, because it just feels safe [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7387.32s)]
*  for me. And I'd get off the session [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7389.32s)]
*  and go right onto the mic. And that was I Love You Boy. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7391.32s)]
*  I Love You Boy was like, [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7393.32s)]
*  the exercise was, I want [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7395.32s)]
*  you to journal [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7397.32s)]
*  and give your inner child [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7399.32s)]
*  the empathy that you wish you got [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7401.32s)]
*  when you were a kid. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7403.32s)]
*  And that was I Love You Boy. And to me, [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7405.32s)]
*  it's the hardest [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7407.32s)]
*  song I had to write because I had to [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7409.32s)]
*  be, [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7411.32s)]
*  I had to be honest [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7413.32s)]
*  about [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7415.32s)]
*  feeling embarrassed about [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7417.32s)]
*  certain moments of my career, like [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7419.32s)]
*  in an interview, why I drank [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7421.32s)]
*  too much and I said [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7423.32s)]
*  ridiculous shit or, you know, [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7425.32s)]
*  just whatever. And it was like, damn, man, [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7427.32s)]
*  like, just having to be honest, [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7429.32s)]
*  like, you know what? [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7431.32s)]
*  I think it gets way more vulnerable than that. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7433.32s)]
*  You fucked up? Oh, no, it's way more, [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7435.32s)]
*  but it's like- It's a great self-reflection. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7437.32s)]
*  Just having to confront [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7439.32s)]
*  things that I've never had to confront [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7441.32s)]
*  and be honest with, like- [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7443.32s)]
*  What you want, and what you did want before a long time [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7445.32s)]
*  before I'm embarrassed of that. What I want [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7447.32s)]
*  and what happened, and yeah, the shame. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7449.32s)]
*  The shame that's attached to [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7451.32s)]
*  wanting something to happen so bad [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7453.32s)]
*  and wanting to be this perfect [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7455.32s)]
*  version of yourself. And you [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7457.32s)]
*  didn't hit the mark all the time. And [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7459.32s)]
*  having to be honest with yourself, like, yeah, you know what? [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7461.32s)]
*  You did fuck up. But you don't [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7463.32s)]
*  need to beat yourself to fuck up. Like, give yourself [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7465.32s)]
*  perpetual punishment. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7467.32s)]
*  And that's what I've done [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7469.32s)]
*  to myself is like- I do that. Well, you would [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7471.32s)]
*  if you were a perfectionist, if that was put [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7473.32s)]
*  on you. If it's not perfect, then it's a failure. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7475.32s)]
*  Exactly. And so now you see the connection. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7477.32s)]
*  Which is why I put out the song Perfections [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7479.32s)]
*  because it's like that perpetual [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7481.32s)]
*  punishment comes from being a perfectionist. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7483.32s)]
*  Because it's like, you know what? You fucked [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7485.32s)]
*  up. And that was then. But this is now. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7487.32s)]
*  I'm gonna let you know that you really [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7489.32s)]
*  fucked this up for us. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7491.32s)]
*  Oh, sorry. Being this vulnerable [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7493.32s)]
*  and putting that much substance in your music, [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7495.32s)]
*  I was just curious. How [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7497.32s)]
*  did you feel about when most devs said [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7499.32s)]
*  Drake is surface level [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7501.32s)]
*  target music? Because I feel like [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7503.32s)]
*  this is the thing. That's one of those things [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7505.32s)]
*  people have been asking of Drake for [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7507.32s)]
*  quite a while. Like, yo, we want [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7509.32s)]
*  to know more about you. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7511.32s)]
*  One, I think Drake has that [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7513.32s)]
*  in his music. Two, I think [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7515.32s)]
*  the world is entitled. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7517.32s)]
*  I think the world is entitled. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7519.32s)]
*  Naturally, I think social media has made [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7521.32s)]
*  people very [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7523.32s)]
*  entitled because we see your Instagram. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7525.32s)]
*  Sometimes we wake up with you and we go to sleep [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7527.32s)]
*  with you. And it gives us this [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7529.32s)]
*  this parasocial [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7531.32s)]
*  of the world. What is that term where it's like [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7533.32s)]
*  parasocial relationship? Yeah, just this [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7535.32s)]
*  weird, like, where we're best friends [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7537.32s)]
*  even though we don't actually fucking know you and we [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7539.32s)]
*  expect all these, you [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7541.32s)]
*  know, entrances [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7543.32s)]
*  into your life. And it's like, [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7545.32s)]
*  yo, we don't know you and you don't owe us anything [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7547.32s)]
*  that you don't want to give us. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7549.32s)]
*  And social media has ruined [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7551.32s)]
*  that. Social media has made people feel like we [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7553.32s)]
*  are entitled to know the [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7555.32s)]
*  ins and outs of your thought [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7557.32s)]
*  process on any and everything that has to do [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7559.32s)]
*  with you. And if you don't give it to us, [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7561.32s)]
*  we feel like you're bullshitting, [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7563.32s)]
*  fake, you're this. And it's like, bro, [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7565.32s)]
*  these people are artists and they give you [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7567.32s)]
*  what they want to give you. And if you don't fuck [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7569.32s)]
*  with it, next song. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7571.32s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? But it's like [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7573.32s)]
*  I feel like one, Drake has that depth. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7575.32s)]
*  How would you break down hip hop? [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7577.32s)]
*  What is hip hop? Because most deaf are saying [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7579.32s)]
*  that's not hip hop. I would think that's [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7581.32s)]
*  hip hop. But I think, I mean, the [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7583.32s)]
*  way I got introduced to hip hop was like [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7585.32s)]
*  it's intelligent movement. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7587.32s)]
*  That's what it is. So I understand the [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7589.32s)]
*  perspective of like you want [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7593.32s)]
*  there to be [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7595.32s)]
*  some sort of intelligence [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7597.32s)]
*  behind the lyrics and not [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7599.32s)]
*  just sort of filler and fluff. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7601.32s)]
*  But the reality is like shit changes [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7603.32s)]
*  and disclaimer, I'm not in any [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7605.32s)]
*  position to speak on what is and what isn't [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7607.32s)]
*  hip hop because I'm white straight up. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7609.32s)]
*  But [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7611.32s)]
*  You're still a hip hop artist. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7613.32s)]
*  But the reality is, well I'm ushered in. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7615.32s)]
*  I'm my guest. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7617.32s)]
*  He gave me like a plus one. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7619.32s)]
*  I was the plus one. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7621.32s)]
*  You got the pass. Not that pass. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7623.32s)]
*  I got the plus one pass. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7625.32s)]
*  At any given moment, [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7627.32s)]
*  all the plus ones get out. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7629.32s)]
*  No, but [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7631.32s)]
*  I think hip hop went from [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7633.32s)]
*  counterculture and underground [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7635.32s)]
*  to mainstream. It's the most popular shit in the [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7637.32s)]
*  world. So naturally [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7639.32s)]
*  it went from people doing hip hop [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7641.32s)]
*  to express [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7643.32s)]
*  and rebel [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7645.32s)]
*  to make money. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7647.32s)]
*  And Jay-Z talks about it [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7649.32s)]
*  in his breakfast club where [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7651.32s)]
*  there was a shift that happened where hip hop [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7653.32s)]
*  became a get rich quick scheme. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7655.32s)]
*  And rap became a get rich quick scheme [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7657.32s)]
*  and when that happened, of course you're going to [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7659.32s)]
*  lose the art because people aren't [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7661.32s)]
*  doing it for the art anymore, they're doing it for the bag. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7663.32s)]
*  So it's like once you realize [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7665.32s)]
*  that, once again, it's just [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7667.32s)]
*  letting go of the resistance. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7669.32s)]
*  It's like, look, if I can just accept [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7671.32s)]
*  the fact that this shit got so big, [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7673.32s)]
*  which was the goal, that it's now [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7675.32s)]
*  become a plausible [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7677.32s)]
*  financial scheme, [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7679.32s)]
*  okay, well now I have to accept [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7681.32s)]
*  that there's going to be some people who are not doing it [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7683.32s)]
*  for the art, they're doing it for the bag. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7685.32s)]
*  And what a great place that [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7687.32s)]
*  we've gotten [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7689.32s)]
*  hip hop and rap to a place where it's so [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7691.32s)]
*  lucrative that people don't even have to be about it [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7693.32s)]
*  for the art. They're there for the money. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7695.32s)]
*  They're there for the money and there's still a bag in it. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7697.32s)]
*  And I'm not saying it's right or wrong, but that is [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7699.32s)]
*  the, it just comes with the dinner. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7701.32s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? It's like... [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7703.32s)]
*  And that's not just hip hop, that's anything that gets popular. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7705.32s)]
*  You're often times shackled to the bag. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7707.32s)]
*  And then once you find something that's [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7709.32s)]
*  lucrative and it provides a living for yourself, [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7711.32s)]
*  a lot of people [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7713.32s)]
*  don't want to [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7715.32s)]
*  move away from that. There's comfort from that. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7717.32s)]
*  Of course. It's also on the people, bro. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7719.32s)]
*  This whole fucking notion, it's so irritating. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7721.32s)]
*  It's like, can we stop acting [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7723.32s)]
*  like there's this big [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7725.32s)]
*  fucking ploy [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7727.32s)]
*  to like only push a certain [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7729.32s)]
*  kind of music? The truth is more [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7731.32s)]
*  boring. The truth is more... It's always [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7733.32s)]
*  more boring. Here's what the truth is. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7735.32s)]
*  The truth is in [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7737.32s)]
*  general, society [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7739.32s)]
*  is attracted to negativity [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7741.32s)]
*  more than positivity. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7743.32s)]
*  Period. Yeah. So [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7745.32s)]
*  guess what? Negative [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7747.32s)]
*  music glorifying negative behaviors [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7749.32s)]
*  and lifestyles will always [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7751.32s)]
*  feel a little sexier because it's a little [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7753.32s)]
*  more dangerous than peace, love, [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7755.32s)]
*  and prosperity. You know what I'm saying? [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7757.32s)]
*  We're drawn to danger, bro. That's just what it is. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7759.32s)]
*  That's just what it is. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7761.32s)]
*  And I mean... If you're in the [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7763.32s)]
*  forest and you hear some branches [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7765.32s)]
*  break or some leaves rustle, [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7767.32s)]
*  you look around. Now, the real shit [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7769.32s)]
*  that no one wants to talk about that, if I talk about [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7771.32s)]
*  it, I'll probably get canceled out. It'll just be the end of us. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7773.32s)]
*  But whatever. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7775.32s)]
*  It's really what I think people should [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7777.32s)]
*  be looking into is [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7779.32s)]
*  white people's [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7781.32s)]
*  fascination with black trauma. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7783.32s)]
*  That is to me... [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7787.32s)]
*  Talk to us. Is very [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7789.32s)]
*  bizarre because... [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7791.32s)]
*  Black people are also fascinated [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7793.32s)]
*  with black trauma. That makes more sense [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7795.32s)]
*  because it lands and it resonates. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7797.32s)]
*  White people are fascinated [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7799.32s)]
*  with black trauma because it's exciting [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7801.32s)]
*  to them because it's over there. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7803.32s)]
*  But they can get close enough to experience it. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7805.32s)]
*  But guess what? When it gets a little too real, [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7807.32s)]
*  they go home. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7809.32s)]
*  So they can participate [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7811.32s)]
*  from a distance. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7813.32s)]
*  Let me ask you this though. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7815.32s)]
*  Mob movies... [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7817.32s)]
*  No, you're actually in a good place [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7819.32s)]
*  to speak on this. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7821.32s)]
*  I think the mob movie rap [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7823.32s)]
*  correlation is such a reach. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7825.32s)]
*  I wouldn't make it mob movies. I'll tell you why. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7827.32s)]
*  Because mob movies, yes, they're based off of [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7829.32s)]
*  something real, but it's also very clear [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7831.32s)]
*  that the majority of it is fiction. There's not [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7833.32s)]
*  that many of them. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7835.32s)]
*  The whole attractiveness [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7837.32s)]
*  of rap is that it's real. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7839.32s)]
*  It's not that it's fiction. They're not playing [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7841.32s)]
*  characters. That's the appeal. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7843.32s)]
*  Right? Especially [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7845.32s)]
*  like, I can speak on this at least [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7847.32s)]
*  is because I was [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7849.32s)]
*  a white boy in the suburbs. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7851.32s)]
*  So I saw firsthand [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7853.32s)]
*  what people like [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7855.32s)]
*  me were attracted to. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7857.32s)]
*  It was that it felt [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7859.32s)]
*  real. It was dangerous. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7861.32s)]
*  It was over there. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7863.32s)]
*  And whoa, like he's really... [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7865.32s)]
*  You see his face tats and like, yo, he just said [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7867.32s)]
*  he slid on this op. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7869.32s)]
*  Whoa, that's crazy. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7871.32s)]
*  And you get close enough where you're like, yo, you see [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7873.32s)]
*  they're fighting over there. And then it gets a little [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7875.32s)]
*  too close to the railing and you're like, yo, we gotta get out of here. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7877.32s)]
*  And that's it. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7879.32s)]
*  That's the reality. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7881.32s)]
*  To me, that [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7883.32s)]
*  is the perplexity [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7885.32s)]
*  of rap. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7887.32s)]
*  The pushback I would give is that I think that [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7889.32s)]
*  like you said, the umbrella is danger. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7891.32s)]
*  We're drawn to danger. Like Jackass, [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7893.32s)]
*  the MTV show, [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7895.32s)]
*  is danger, right? [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7897.32s)]
*  These people are gonna go prank people. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7899.32s)]
*  Hold on, let me get this. They're gonna go [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7901.32s)]
*  prank people and they're gonna make people [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7903.32s)]
*  feel really uncomfortable and something that [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7905.32s)]
*  I would never do. I can't believe this is so [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7907.32s)]
*  embarrassing, but they're gonna put themselves in that position to [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7909.32s)]
*  embarrass them. Eric Andre, [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7911.32s)]
*  for example, he does these great stunts and you're like, [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7913.32s)]
*  oh my god, this is so embarrassing. I would feel so uncomfortable [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7915.32s)]
*  if I was that person in that environment, but I'm drawn to it. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7917.32s)]
*  I can't look away. There is a [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7919.32s)]
*  fascination with the dangerous. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7921.32s)]
*  Even in the way that we're attracted to [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7923.32s)]
*  anime or even kung fu movies, [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7925.32s)]
*  I feel like white and black people are attracted to this [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7927.32s)]
*  Asian thing that was dubbed over [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7929.32s)]
*  and we're still like, these are some badass motherfuckers. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7931.32s)]
*  Maybe they're going out and killing all the people. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7933.32s)]
*  I love this point you're making, because this is a conversation [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7935.32s)]
*  me and my boy have had. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7937.32s)]
*  So I think that there is an attraction to [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7939.32s)]
*  the dangerous, [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7941.32s)]
*  and we exalt those figures [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7943.32s)]
*  that are willing to do these dangerous things. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7945.32s)]
*  UFC fighters, boxers, [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7947.32s)]
*  the things that we fear. A bare-knuckle [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7949.32s)]
*  street fighter. Kimbo Slice, [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7951.32s)]
*  you made himself, but we also made him [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7953.32s)]
*  a celebrity simply off the fact that he was [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7955.32s)]
*  knuckling up in the backyard in Miami. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7957.32s)]
*  So I think that we are drawn [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7959.32s)]
*  to these figures that are willing to do the things that we don't. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7961.32s)]
*  And rappers specifically [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7963.32s)]
*  are rapping about these things that we're [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7965.32s)]
*  terrified of, but we are really [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7967.32s)]
*  intrigued by. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7969.32s)]
*  I agree 100%. Everything you said, [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7971.32s)]
*  I agree, and you know what? This is what I think. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7973.32s)]
*  I think [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7975.32s)]
*  I think [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7977.32s)]
*  I think [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7979.32s)]
*  rappers who are rapping about a certain [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7981.32s)]
*  traumatic experience in black [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7983.32s)]
*  lifestyle that's particular and specific [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7985.32s)]
*  to them, it's appealing to [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7987.32s)]
*  other people who have [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7989.32s)]
*  felt those same traumas, and I've been [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7991.32s)]
*  through that, right? To white people [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7993.32s)]
*  it's, we're just attracted to [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7995.32s)]
*  the danger. Why? [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7997.32s)]
*  It's because 21 Savage is John Wick to [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=7999.32s)]
*  white boys. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8001.32s)]
*  That's the reality. Rappers are the new action [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8003.32s)]
*  heroes. To white people. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8005.32s)]
*  But to black America, [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8007.32s)]
*  rappers are, you're speaking our trauma, [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8009.32s)]
*  and it lands for us, and it [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8011.32s)]
*  resonates, right? But to white [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8013.32s)]
*  boys, which is like, [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8015.32s)]
*  the reality is, the main consumer [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8017.32s)]
*  We're interpreting it correctly though. The black [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8019.32s)]
*  people aren't. Because the rappers are [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8021.32s)]
*  lying, so we're treating you like the liar, [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8023.32s)]
*  which is John Wick. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8025.32s)]
*  It's not entirely because if they lying, [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8027.32s)]
*  if they lying, then we stop fucking with them. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8029.32s)]
*  If you really about that life, [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8031.32s)]
*  how many of these rappers are lying and we still [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8033.32s)]
*  fuck with them? [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8035.32s)]
*  There would still be the difference between an action [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8037.32s)]
*  movie and a movie that's a drama. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8039.32s)]
*  I hear what you're saying. The main [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8041.32s)]
*  consumer, when I [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8043.32s)]
*  say consumer, I mean the people putting money into it. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8045.32s)]
*  The main consumer, the main ticket buyer [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8047.32s)]
*  of rap is a white boy. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8049.32s)]
*  Right? [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8051.32s)]
*  Those people are there not because the content [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8053.32s)]
*  lands, they're saying the [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8055.32s)]
*  N-word. They're there because they're getting to watch [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8057.32s)]
*  John Wick up close. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8059.32s)]
*  Meanwhile, John Wick is on [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8061.32s)]
*  stage like, this is real [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8063.32s)]
*  trauma. This is [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8065.32s)]
*  like, this is not a lie. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8067.32s)]
*  If he is. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8069.32s)]
*  Now when we go down that road, [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8071.32s)]
*  here's my issue with it. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8073.32s)]
*  Let's go down that road. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8075.32s)]
*  So you're lying about being John Wick. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8077.32s)]
*  Okay. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8079.32s)]
*  If you're lying about being John [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8081.32s)]
*  Wick, [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8083.32s)]
*  promoting a negative lifestyle, [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8085.32s)]
*  for commercial [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8087.32s)]
*  gain, [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8089.32s)]
*  to me, that's fucked up. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8091.32s)]
*  Now if this is really your lifestyle [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8093.32s)]
*  and you're just expressing your trauma, I respect [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8095.32s)]
*  it. But if [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8097.32s)]
*  you're lying, [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8099.32s)]
*  it's a little [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8101.32s)]
*  fucked up. And so here's the real question [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8103.32s)]
*  to me. The real question is, [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8105.32s)]
*  are you [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8107.32s)]
*  publicly admitting to [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8109.32s)]
*  crimes you commit, which makes you dumb, [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8111.32s)]
*  or are you lying about a negative [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8113.32s)]
*  lifestyle which makes you a little [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8115.32s)]
*  evil? Which one [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8117.32s)]
*  is it? I think it's a little bit of both. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8119.32s)]
*  Maybe a little, which, guess what? [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8121.32s)]
*  It usually starts somewhere [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8123.32s)]
*  and they're like, hey, this is my truth, and then they [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8125.32s)]
*  get a little money, they [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8127.32s)]
*  distance themselves from it, but now they can still [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8129.32s)]
*  speak on experiences that they [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8131.32s)]
*  lived. That they had. Which, yeah. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8133.32s)]
*  I think, like I said, when [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8135.32s)]
*  it's real to you, I think [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8137.32s)]
*  by all means, I think the policing [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8139.32s)]
*  of rappers' actual [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8141.32s)]
*  real life trauma is fucked. Let [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8143.32s)]
*  them talk about what they went through. Right? [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8145.32s)]
*  I think if you are making [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8147.32s)]
*  this shit up because you know [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8149.32s)]
*  what's popular is to talk about [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8151.32s)]
*  sliding on ops and popping perks, [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8153.32s)]
*  I think you're evil. But isn't that what [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8155.32s)]
*  you also just said of anytime [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8157.32s)]
*  something becomes the culture, there's going to be people who just try to profit off of it, and that's okay? [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8159.32s)]
*  Yeah, but that doesn't mean it's not fucked up. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8163.32s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Yes, they're [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8165.32s)]
*  doing that, but that's fucked up. Now what if they said, [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8167.32s)]
*  hey, Russ, you probably embellish [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8169.32s)]
*  things about your life and your music. I don't, [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8171.32s)]
*  in fact. Nothing? Nothing. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8173.32s)]
*  There's no line about fucking bitches [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8175.32s)]
*  that you didn't exactly do? No. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8177.32s)]
*  God damn it. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8179.32s)]
*  No. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8181.32s)]
*  Holy body, you're coming for us. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8183.32s)]
*  Don't break from this podcast, they bring you blue chew. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8185.32s)]
*  So you can fuck bitches like Russ does in this music. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8187.32s)]
*  You see these blue lights, baby? You know what that means? [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8189.32s)]

*  Let's get back to the show. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8233.32s)]
*  I'll tell you, the only thing I ever lied about on a rap [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8235.32s)]
*  song was on Kill Them All and I called my [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8237.32s)]
*  business manager and he talked me out of it [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8239.32s)]
*  was on Kill Them All when I mentioned [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8241.32s)]
*  like something, something like [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8243.32s)]
*  run over these bloggers in my Lambo [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8245.32s)]
*  and I swear to god, [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8247.32s)]
*  I called my business manager right now, I said [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8249.32s)]
*  bro, like I don't have a Lambo, I have a [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8251.32s)]
*  McLaren, like [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8253.32s)]
*  I think I should buy a Lambo. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8255.32s)]
*  So I just went, [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8257.32s)]
*  I swear to god, I swear on my [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8259.32s)]
*  mom's life, on everyone's life, [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8261.32s)]
*  that was the only time I ever lied on my rap. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8263.32s)]
*  And in fact, if we, maybe I [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8265.32s)]
*  changed the line, but yeah, that was [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8267.32s)]
*  the only time I ever lied because it, I'm [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8269.32s)]
*  not making music to persuade [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8271.32s)]
*  y'all, I'm making music for me. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8273.32s)]
*  So if I'm not really doing the drugs [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8275.32s)]
*  or if I'm not really having the trauma, [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8277.32s)]
*  I'm not pushing it. Okay, but you [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8279.32s)]
*  say it's a negative thing, but well, [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8281.32s)]
*  we have movies, like movies are [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8283.32s)]
*  fiction. No, bro. Like movies are. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8285.32s)]
*  There's a difference between saying this is my life [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8287.32s)]
*  and this is fiction. I love this debate, [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8289.32s)]
*  I love this debate because [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8291.32s)]
*  it doesn't land. I'll tell you [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8293.32s)]
*  why. There's no light to stand on. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8295.32s)]
*  Movies are under the notion [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8297.32s)]
*  that it's fiction, like you said. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8299.32s)]
*  When you watch Scarface, you're going into [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8301.32s)]
*  the theater like I'm about to watch a story. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8303.32s)]
*  The appeal [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8305.32s)]
*  to rap is that it's real. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8307.32s)]
*  In fact, to the point [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8309.32s)]
*  that rappers make it a point [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8311.32s)]
*  to say that they're real. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8313.32s)]
*  That whole notion of like, nah. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8315.32s)]
*  That's the thing. It's like you're selling [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8317.32s)]
*  art. So if I have a [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8319.32s)]
*  stage name, I have a persona. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8321.32s)]
*  You're absorbing accountability. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8323.32s)]
*  You're absorbing accountability. I don't think so. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8325.32s)]
*  I think you are because the reality is, that's fine, [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8327.32s)]
*  but then make it clear that it's the WWE. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8329.32s)]
*  But don't go out of [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8331.32s)]
*  your way to it. WWE doesn't make it clear. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8333.32s)]
*  It's WWE. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8335.32s)]
*  Rap has received a lot of criticism for it. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8337.32s)]
*  Watch, watch. It doesn't matter. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8339.32s)]
*  No one says what they're doing is bad. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8341.32s)]
*  WWE makes it clear [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8343.32s)]
*  to the people who, like, at a certain [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8345.32s)]
*  age, you know Santa Claus isn't real. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8347.32s)]
*  WWE has never said publicly [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8349.32s)]
*  these are stage presence. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8351.32s)]
*  If you have eyeballs, you know. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8353.32s)]
*  You know the difference between selling stuff. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8355.32s)]
*  And I feel the same way when you see a rapper. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8357.32s)]
*  Nah, because you know that shit is bullshit. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8359.32s)]
*  That's exactly how I feel about rap. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8361.32s)]
*  Realistically, right, a lot of [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8363.32s)]
*  the appeal of rap, this is what I'm saying, because when you [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8365.32s)]
*  keep in mind that the main consumer [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8367.32s)]
*  is a white boy who thinks it's real, [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8369.32s)]
*  you have to understand that [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8371.32s)]
*  the appeal is that it is real. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8373.32s)]
*  So like, even though [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8375.32s)]
*  they're not saying it, they're not [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8377.32s)]
*  not saying it. You see what I'm saying? It's like [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8379.32s)]
*  the whole appeal of like this [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8381.32s)]
*  slide on art music is like, yo, I think they [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8383.32s)]
*  really are. And a lot of them [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8385.32s)]
*  really are. But wrestling's that. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8387.32s)]
*  Like people thought Stone Cold hung out [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8389.32s)]
*  with his friends and went like that and [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8391.32s)]
*  drank his beer. Rap is not wrestling. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8393.32s)]
*  Here's what I would say. The appeal of [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8395.32s)]
*  rap was that it was not wrestling. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8397.32s)]
*  The appeal of rap was that it was real. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8399.32s)]
*  Everyone is under the notion [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8401.32s)]
*  that it's real. I understand the point. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8403.32s)]
*  I know, because we're all grown men, [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8405.32s)]
*  that it's not real. But I'm saying [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8407.32s)]
*  the appeal is that it's real. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8409.32s)]
*  A lot of people still believe it's real and also there are rappers [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8411.32s)]
*  who live that life. It's still real to me, damn it. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8413.32s)]
*  Have you seen that? [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8415.32s)]
*  I think 70% of people at a wrestling show [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8417.32s)]
*  think that shit is real. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8419.32s)]
*  No, it's not 70%, but here's what it is. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8421.32s)]
*  I dare any of y'all to come out [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8423.32s)]
*  and say [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8425.32s)]
*  one of these rappers is lying about [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8427.32s)]
*  the shit they're rapping about. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8429.32s)]
*  Because that rapper will die on a hill defending [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8431.32s)]
*  the shit they're making up. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8433.32s)]
*  I think most of us know. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8435.32s)]
*  They say they're telling the truth. That's what I'm saying. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8437.32s)]
*  It's like wrestling [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8439.32s)]
*  in that we know [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8441.32s)]
*  at a certain age, you know it's fake, [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8443.32s)]
*  but we all just kind of [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8445.32s)]
*  and I can't speak for black people, [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8447.32s)]
*  but I think the wrestlers kind of buy into [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8449.32s)]
*  look, we know most of this is bullshit, [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8451.32s)]
*  but let's all pretend it's real because it's just [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8453.32s)]
*  a fun thing like wrestling. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8455.32s)]
*  It's just a fun storyline we're all buying into [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8457.32s)]
*  and I can't speak for the black consumer, but I think [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8459.32s)]
*  most of us at a certain age know [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8461.32s)]
*  most these rappers ain't doing nothing, they got fucking [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8463.32s)]
*  Roth IRAs or whatever [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8465.32s)]
*  investment accounts and we're all buying into this game. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8467.32s)]
*  We have [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8469.32s)]
*  aged out of the [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8471.32s)]
*  audience that is influenced [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8473.32s)]
*  the most by rap. We've aged out. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8475.32s)]
*  So you're talking, right? [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8477.32s)]
*  We're talking amongst each other [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8479.32s)]
*  as grown men who understand that [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8481.32s)]
*  it's not Santa who's bringing the presence. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8483.32s)]
*  The audience that's most [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8485.32s)]
*  influenced by rap thinks it's [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8487.32s)]
*  real and the issue [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8489.32s)]
*  that I have is that if [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8491.32s)]
*  it is not real, [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8493.32s)]
*  don't push it [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8495.32s)]
*  because it's negative. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8497.32s)]
*  Now if what you're pushing is positive and it's not [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8499.32s)]
*  real, push it [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8501.32s)]
*  by all means. That's Santa Claus. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8503.32s)]
*  Santa Claus isn't real, but [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8505.32s)]
*  it's positive. Y'all shit [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8507.32s)]
*  isn't real, but it's negative. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8509.32s)]
*  You're not even living it? [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8511.32s)]
*  Nikki spoke on Future saying when I talked to Future [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8513.32s)]
*  he told me he wasn't [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8515.32s)]
*  even doing the drugs that he talks about [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8517.32s)]
*  in the songs. I think Future's [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8519.32s)]
*  music is amazing. I'm grown enough to [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8521.32s)]
*  have the discernment to say, man, this shit [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8523.32s)]
*  is, stick to the models is like my favorite [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8525.32s)]
*  shit, right? [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8527.32s)]
*  Sorry, stick to the models by Future is my [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8529.32s)]
*  favorite shit, right? But I also know [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8531.32s)]
*  that the reason why I wanted to try [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8533.32s)]
*  Lean when I was 19 was [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8535.32s)]
*  Future. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8537.32s)]
*  And I'm not going to blame him. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8539.32s)]
*  I'm grown. I did think the drug shit [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8541.32s)]
*  was real. I need to slide on off so I think [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8543.32s)]
*  the drug shit kind of was. I'll tell you [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8545.32s)]
*  why the drug shit can't be real. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8547.32s)]
*  Because you cannot [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8549.32s)]
*  do that many drugs and live [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8551.32s)]
*  this long. Okay. But not to advocate [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8553.32s)]
*  for negative. Which is why when Juice World said [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8555.32s)]
*  I started doing these drugs because of you, [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8557.32s)]
*  we have seen it live [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8559.32s)]
*  in the flesh. Juice World [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8561.32s)]
*  said I did drugs because of you. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8563.32s)]
*  Juice World died of a [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8565.32s)]
*  drug overdose by following [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8567.32s)]
*  somebody who does not even do the drugs that they said [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8569.32s)]
*  they did. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8571.32s)]
*  What the fuck are we talking about? [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8573.32s)]
*  Everyone wants to tip toe around the fucking [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8575.32s)]
*  because certain people are Teflon and you can't [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8577.32s)]
*  talk on certain shit. Why is there a defense of this [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8579.32s)]
*  around this, Al? What do you think that is? [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8581.32s)]
*  Because people are trying to protect [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8583.32s)]
*  free speech even if the free speech [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8585.32s)]
*  is negative. I don't think it's free speech. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8587.32s)]
*  It is. I think it's a cultural... [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8589.32s)]
*  It's like, oh, we should be able to say what we say. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8591.32s)]
*  You can't but then also face the consequence. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8593.32s)]
*  I think it's cultural success. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8595.32s)]
*  I think it's free speech. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8597.32s)]
*  I think it's we should be able to say what we can say. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8599.32s)]
*  But then that's fine. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8601.32s)]
*  But you cannot absorb yourself of the accountability [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8603.32s)]
*  when you have to face the consequence [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8605.32s)]
*  of your actions and when the chickens come home [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8607.32s)]
*  to roost. When Juice World who did [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8609.32s)]
*  drugs because of you dies, [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8611.32s)]
*  that is a real moment [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8613.32s)]
*  of reflectiveness that needs to happen within the culture. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8615.32s)]
*  Oh, real quick, real quick, real quick. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8617.32s)]
*  That's the reality. Am I tripping? [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8619.32s)]
*  No, you're not. But I don't think anyone like... [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8621.32s)]
*  When Alex Jones or when Tucker Carlson [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8623.32s)]
*  or any of these dudes that [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8625.32s)]
*  were supposed to be taken [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8627.32s)]
*  on face value, right, as like [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8629.32s)]
*  news sources and they were telling the truth, [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8631.32s)]
*  when they back up and they go, [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8633.32s)]
*  I'm just doing this for entertainment, they get ridiculed. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8635.32s)]
*  How dare you manipulate [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8637.32s)]
*  all these people. Right, right. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8639.32s)]
*  But what I'm saying is you could make the same argument that [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8641.32s)]
*  Alex Jones, Tucker Carlson, any of these guys are auto-wappers. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8643.32s)]
*  No, because presenting yourself as a news is different. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8645.32s)]
*  No, but I see where you're going. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8647.32s)]
*  You won me over with Juice World but you can't go news [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8649.32s)]
*  is news. It is, I'm presenting this [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8651.32s)]
*  as news for you to [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8653.32s)]
*  like, consume as facts. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8655.32s)]
*  But you have to understand to a 17-year-old [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8657.32s)]
*  how is that different? To a 17-year-old, [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8659.32s)]
*  a rapper is giving them news on the culture. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8661.32s)]
*  But it's the same thing. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8663.32s)]
*  It's candy news. It's like sports is real. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8665.32s)]
*  I think we're kind of arguing [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8667.32s)]
*  two things. Like, no one's trying to [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8669.32s)]
*  absolve [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8671.32s)]
*  rappers, like, [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8673.32s)]
*  influence. Like, [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8675.32s)]
*  a parent should raise [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8677.32s)]
*  their kids. Yes, kids can look up to [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8679.32s)]
*  somebody and be influenced by, but at the end [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8681.32s)]
*  of the day, it's up to the parents to raise [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8683.32s)]
*  their kids. So it's like, this artist [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8685.32s)]
*  should be able to be an artist. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8687.32s)]
*  If they are actually, and we [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8689.32s)]
*  can't act like this [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8691.32s)]
*  shit isn't going on. Yes, there are some rappers out of [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8693.32s)]
*  running, but there are rappers that really are about [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8695.32s)]
*  that life. We see it happening. We see [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8697.32s)]
*  Chicago. We see, there are. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8699.32s)]
*  So it's like, [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8701.32s)]
*  you can't put all the onus on [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8703.32s)]
*  the artist. No, no, no, and for a disclaimer, I'm not [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8705.32s)]
*  talking about the ones who are actually talking. Like I said, [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8707.32s)]
*  I'm not talking about the ones who are actually talking about the [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8709.32s)]
*  drama. No, but even the ones that aren't. No, but see, that's where you [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8711.32s)]
*  have to start raising an eyebrow of like, [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8713.32s)]
*  this is a little bit evil, because if you are [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8715.32s)]
*  purposely choosing [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8717.32s)]
*  to promote a negatively [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8719.32s)]
*  influential lifestyle that you yourself [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8721.32s)]
*  are not even living, this is [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8723.32s)]
*  fucked up. I'm not talking about the ones [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8725.32s)]
*  who are like, yo, like, I really [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8727.32s)]
*  lived this. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8729.32s)]
*  I did X, Y, and Z. I'm [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8731.32s)]
*  using my music as a journal to talk about it. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8733.32s)]
*  I have, like, let them express what they express. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8735.32s)]
*  The ones who are not doing it, [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8737.32s)]
*  but they're doing it because it makes money, [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8739.32s)]
*  and then they have blood on their [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8741.32s)]
*  hands. I'm going to further reinforce the [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8743.32s)]
*  stereotypes of the black community [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8745.32s)]
*  from my personal gain. And to that point, [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8747.32s)]
*  that's a crazy intro. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8749.32s)]
*  But that's essentially what the criticism is. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8751.32s)]
*  It's like, if you are living these things, [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8753.32s)]
*  that's incredibly unfortunate, and you were born [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8755.32s)]
*  into a situation you probably couldn't avoid, [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8757.32s)]
*  and you should be able to speak on your experience. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8759.32s)]
*  But if you did not live them at all, you are further [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8761.32s)]
*  reinforcing the stereotypes of the black community [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8763.32s)]
*  just so you personally can gain [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8765.32s)]
*  money while those people continue to suffer. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8767.32s)]
*  That's the definition of selling your soul. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8769.32s)]
*  That's the definition of selling your soul. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8771.32s)]
*  That criticism is good. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8773.32s)]
*  But two, what we're all talking about, [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8775.32s)]
*  because what I've heard from a lot of people [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8777.32s)]
*  sitting here is, well, [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8779.32s)]
*  but it's WWE. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8781.32s)]
*  Okay, so what we're saying, [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8783.32s)]
*  what I hear, is that [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8785.32s)]
*  majority of rappers have sold their soul. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8787.32s)]
*  But it's okay, because it's art. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8789.32s)]
*  Obviously, also to his point, it's not just [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8791.32s)]
*  negative reinforcement. It sets up a negative [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8793.32s)]
*  reward system where you think to yourself, [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8795.32s)]
*  if I want to make it, I gotta be one of the [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8797.32s)]
*  real guys. Not even fake it. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8799.32s)]
*  I gotta be real, otherwise if I [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8801.32s)]
*  get my card called, I'm phony. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8803.32s)]
*  I might have to live that life. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8805.32s)]
*  I think it's a little hypocritical to just call out [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8807.32s)]
*  that, because this happens [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8809.32s)]
*  in society everywhere. There are people [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8811.32s)]
*  that are selling cancer to you. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8813.32s)]
*  There's people that sell, like, tobacco, [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8815.32s)]
*  industry, and shit like that. I wouldn't say it's hypocritical. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8817.32s)]
*  I would just say it's hyper-focusing. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8819.32s)]
*  If you work for Philip Morris, [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8821.32s)]
*  I know, but okay. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8823.32s)]
*  Nobody's calling this shit out. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8825.32s)]
*  That's like that tweet where it's like, if you say [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8827.32s)]
*  you don't like oranges, someone's like, what? [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8829.32s)]
*  So, pineapples just get off the... [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8831.32s)]
*  Multiple things can be wrong. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8833.32s)]
*  McDonald's has received so much criticism, bro. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8835.32s)]
*  There's been so many documentaries [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8837.32s)]
*  that supersized me as a documenter. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8839.32s)]
*  There's constant criticism. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8841.32s)]
*  We're talking about artists [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8843.32s)]
*  that are putting out [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8845.32s)]
*  that music, and it's up to the people [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8847.32s)]
*  at home who consume that music [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8849.32s)]
*  how they live their life, listening to it. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8851.32s)]
*  If you're raised right, and you know we can [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8853.32s)]
*  all listen to a future song and not be influenced [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8855.32s)]
*  by it. You said, hey... [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8857.32s)]
*  That's because we're grown now. Yeah, but [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8859.32s)]
*  if your parents were a little bit [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8861.32s)]
*  closer to you, they wouldn't have [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8863.32s)]
*  let you have access to that [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8865.32s)]
*  leave. No, no, no. You might have [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8867.32s)]
*  wanted to try it, but... No, let's pump the brakes, right? [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8869.32s)]
*  We were all 19 once, right? [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8871.32s)]
*  At some point, you're [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8873.32s)]
*  outside of your parents' supervision. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8875.32s)]
*  So at 19, when I'm [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8877.32s)]
*  like first dabbling into music, [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8879.32s)]
*  I'm drinking, I'm smoking weed, [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8881.32s)]
*  Fuchsia's going crazy, he's dropping Tony Montana. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8883.32s)]
*  I'm like, dog, this is crazy. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8885.32s)]
*  And especially in Atlanta, it was a different [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8887.32s)]
*  time. You know what I mean? It was... You're sitting next to two people [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8889.32s)]
*  that have never done drugs, [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8891.32s)]
*  didn't have sex before marriage. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8893.32s)]
*  See, but everyone's... Not everybody [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8895.32s)]
*  is influenced by what they... I agree. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8897.32s)]
*  But to your point, [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8899.32s)]
*  not everyone is influenced by [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8901.32s)]
*  what some people are. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8903.32s)]
*  So you can't just write... Put it on the artists? [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8905.32s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8907.32s)]
*  What I'm saying is you can't just [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8909.32s)]
*  say, well, these [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8911.32s)]
*  two people weren't influenced, so it's not [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8913.32s)]
*  at all on the artists. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8915.32s)]
*  Hold on, hold on. Even though [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8917.32s)]
*  someone like Juice WRLD literally told [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8919.32s)]
*  Fuchsia himself, I started doing [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8921.32s)]
*  Lean because of you. [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8923.32s)]
*  Let's say there's... We can't absorb that. [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8925.32s)]
*  I'm not saying there's an absolute yes, there's some... [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8927.32s)]
*  It's not that black, come on. Yeah. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8929.32s)]
*  Let's say that there's zero influence, right? [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8931.32s)]
*  Let's say it doesn't impact a single person. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8933.32s)]
*  Nobody does drugs because of it, [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8935.32s)]
*  nothing, right? Everything's the same, [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8937.32s)]
*  society doesn't change at all. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8939.32s)]
*  You could still [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8941.32s)]
*  go, you are profiting [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8943.32s)]
*  off of a trauma [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8945.32s)]
*  that is not yours, that you [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8947.32s)]
*  are also reinforcing a negative [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8949.32s)]
*  stereotype, even if it doesn't turn [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8951.32s)]
*  into anything. That's true, too. You still [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8953.32s)]
*  are profiting off of... I agree. Do you know what I'm saying? [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8955.32s)]
*  That's kind of where I was coming from at first, [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8957.32s)]
*  which is, if it's not your real life... [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8959.32s)]
*  You could argue that... [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8961.32s)]
*  That's the culture vulture. I'm just saying... [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8963.32s)]
*  I agree. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8965.32s)]
*  It's an icky way to make money, but there's a lot [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8967.32s)]
*  of people that make money... [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8969.32s)]
*  See, Al, [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8971.32s)]
*  this is where you're missing the mark. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8973.32s)]
*  Nobody ever [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8975.32s)]
*  says somebody who works for Philip Morris [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8977.32s)]
*  didn't sell his soul. You sell cigarettes, [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8979.32s)]
*  you made it a point to sell cigarettes to kids, [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8981.32s)]
*  you sold your fucking soul. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8983.32s)]
*  Nobody, if you call a cigarette company, is going to be like, [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8985.32s)]
*  bruh, what about drug dealers? [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8987.32s)]
*  Nah, motherfucker, it's you. You sold your soul. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8989.32s)]
*  So I just don't like that what about-ism [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8991.32s)]
*  of, well, what about these others? We're not calling [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8993.32s)]
*  them out. Of course we call them out. We call them all the fucking time. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8995.32s)]
*  If you're McDonald's and you decided [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8997.32s)]
*  we want to eat your fried chicken, you sold [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=8999.32s)]
*  your fucking soul. Ray Kroc sold his fucking [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9001.32s)]
*  soul. Y'all sold your soul. We call [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9003.32s)]
*  them all out. I will agree. It's an icky way [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9005.32s)]
*  to make money, but at the same time, [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9007.32s)]
*  I think you have the [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9009.32s)]
*  liberty of being an artist where it's like, [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9011.32s)]
*  hey, you get to make whatever [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9013.32s)]
*  type of art you want to make. If it's not [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9015.32s)]
*  positive art, then don't consume it. [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9017.32s)]
*  Or just admit you're lying. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9019.32s)]
*  No, no, no. Just admit you're playing a character. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9021.32s)]
*  Look, look, look. I think [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9023.32s)]
*  to like, close it out, [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9025.32s)]
*  I think, make what you want to make, [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9027.32s)]
*  but also, don't [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9029.32s)]
*  absolve yourself of accountability [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9031.32s)]
*  when it [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9033.32s)]
*  comes down to like, yo, if you're talking about [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9035.32s)]
*  something that's negative and pushing something [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9037.32s)]
*  that's negative, that you didn't actually do or [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9039.32s)]
*  live, but you're doing it because that makes money, [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9041.32s)]
*  you sold your soul. Yeah, yeah. Simple as that. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9043.32s)]
*  We can agree on that. And just own it. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9045.32s)]
*  But like, this whole notion that like, [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9047.32s)]
*  nah, chill, people should be able to [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9049.32s)]
*  talk about what they talk about. Oh yeah, you can, [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9051.32s)]
*  but guess what you're also not exempt [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9053.32s)]
*  from is criticism for selling [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9055.32s)]
*  your soul. The Jews world thing completely flipped me. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9057.32s)]
*  I only thought about violence and I think most of us know better. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9059.32s)]
*  That's not my opinion. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9061.32s)]
*  That is documented. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9063.32s)]
*  He told him that. And Nicky is [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9065.32s)]
*  in interviews saying, I think [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9067.32s)]
*  it was to Joe Budden, saying that Future told [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9069.32s)]
*  her that he doesn't do the drugs [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9071.32s)]
*  that he talks about. So it's like, [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9073.32s)]
*  that to me, like I said, [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9075.32s)]
*  I have a whole future playlist. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9077.32s)]
*  Because I'm grown and I can like, you know, [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9079.32s)]
*  use the sermon, but it's still, it's like, [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9081.32s)]
*  oh, when you see somebody like Jews world [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9083.32s)]
*  who their introduction to it [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9085.32s)]
*  was because you glorified [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9087.32s)]
*  it, that, I mean, that's god [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9089.32s)]
*  crazy. But then it's also, hey, [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9091.32s)]
*  where's your parents, friends, family, [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9093.32s)]
*  people around you. No, come on. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9095.32s)]
*  Because then we're acting like, no, then we're acting like, [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9097.32s)]
*  they also failed us. No, that's not true. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9099.32s)]
*  Like you can't put it all on it. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9101.32s)]
*  That's not only Future's fault. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9103.32s)]
*  Because then we're acting like none of us were 19 before [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9105.32s)]
*  where even if you had good parents, [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9107.32s)]
*  you just didn't want to be 19 and wild [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9109.32s)]
*  out because that shit sounded cool. But yes, there are [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9111.32s)]
*  19 year olds that didn't want to wild [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9113.32s)]
*  out. But then the ones who did, [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9115.32s)]
*  they're the vast minority though. No, no, no. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9117.32s)]
*  You could argue the foundation is set by the parents [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9119.32s)]
*  and you should have the foundation. Listen, minority and majority is [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9121.32s)]
*  irrelevant. The fact that there are [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9123.32s)]
*  19 year olds who chose to wild out [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9125.32s)]
*  because they heard he was wilding out, even though he [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9127.32s)]
*  wasn't wilding out, cannot just be [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9129.32s)]
*  ignored for the sake of an argument. [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9131.32s)]
*  That still has to be like, yo, that's kind of [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9133.32s)]
*  fucked up. We're not saying that's the whole [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9135.32s)]
*  blame. We're not saying that that's, oh, [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9137.32s)]
*  that's what's wrong with the world. [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9139.32s)]
*  But there needs to be accountability. [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9141.32s)]
*  It can't just be like, [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9143.32s)]
*  alright, so some people died, big deal. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9145.32s)]
*  It can't just be that. [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9147.32s)]
*  Because that's the alternative. The alternative is like, [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9149.32s)]
*  so what? So somebody died. [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9151.32s)]
*  Because he followed what he said. Big deal. [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9153.32s)]
*  It can't be that. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9155.32s)]
*  You could also argue it's worse from an artist [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9157.32s)]
*  than it is from a Philip Morris because [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9159.32s)]
*  at least I know those guys are just trying to make money. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9161.32s)]
*  Art is supposed to be art. [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9163.32s)]
*  The art that hurts [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9165.32s)]
*  people that you're just saying, no, I'm just trying [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9167.32s)]
*  to make money and calling it art. And that's [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9169.32s)]
*  kind of like, as an artist, [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9171.32s)]
*  fuck you a little bit. And I was on [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9173.32s)]
*  your side 20 minutes ago. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9175.32s)]
*  But the guys at Philip Morris were spending [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9177.32s)]
*  money trying to convince people that [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9179.32s)]
*  this isn't bad for you. Dude, they're bad too. [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9181.32s)]
*  They're bad too. But you could argue, [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9183.32s)]
*  but to defend the artist and be like, dude, [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9185.32s)]
*  that's art. I'm telling you, as an artist, [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9187.32s)]
*  if your art is killing people and [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9189.32s)]
*  it's not even real to you, I could argue [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9191.32s)]
*  that's even scummier. And you can [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9193.32s)]
*  hear the picture on half of these cigarette companies. [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9195.32s)]
*  These are monsters. You could argue. [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9197.32s)]
*  To say you can't argue that is wild. [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9199.32s)]
*  You can't argue that. In the [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9201.32s)]
*  guise of art, having people killed [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9203.32s)]
*  is worse than, hey, here's a product [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9205.32s)]
*  that I'm selling as a product and a consumer good [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9207.32s)]
*  that's killing people. Because I know you're a greedy fuck. [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9209.32s)]
*  I know you. I clock you as a greedy [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9211.32s)]
*  cocksucker trying to drive up a share board. [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9213.32s)]
*  That's also what corporations are. [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9215.32s)]
*  I just think we're coddling humans to be [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9217.32s)]
*  like, oh, well, you don't have the wherewithal [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9219.32s)]
*  to know that you shouldn't do the thing that you're listening to. [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9221.32s)]
*  No, not coddling. We're just saying the... [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9223.32s)]
*  There is also accountability. [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9225.32s)]
*  I think we are underestimating [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9227.32s)]
*  the societal [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9229.32s)]
*  pressures to just [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9231.32s)]
*  be amongst and just be 18 [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9233.32s)]
*  and be 19. But why can you be 18 [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9235.32s)]
*  and 19 and watch John Wick [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9237.32s)]
*  and not want to go out shooting everybody? [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9239.32s)]
*  Why do you have that wherewithal? [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9241.32s)]
*  This correlation is... [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9243.32s)]
*  John Wick is in a documentary. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9245.32s)]
*  Why do you have the wherewithal to know that? [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9247.32s)]
*  You know, you're aware of the [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9249.32s)]
*  difference between a movie... [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9251.32s)]
*  That to me, exactly. Hold on. [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9253.32s)]
*  Hold on. Let me talk. [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9255.32s)]
*  Because [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9257.32s)]
*  I hate that analogy. I always [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9259.32s)]
*  have. Because it's acting [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9261.32s)]
*  as if it's like gaslighting [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9263.32s)]
*  to me. It's trying [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9265.32s)]
*  to make it seem like [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9267.32s)]
*  future is John Wick. [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9269.32s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. We got [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9271.32s)]
*  introduced... I think future is John Wick. [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9273.32s)]
*  Because you're grown. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9275.32s)]
*  I'd never heard a [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9277.32s)]
*  future lyric that made me want to do [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9279.32s)]
*  the thing. Hold on, hold on, hold on. [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9281.32s)]
*  This is important. When I was listening to [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9283.32s)]
*  March of Madness, I did not DMX though. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9285.32s)]
*  Keanu Reeves exists. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9287.32s)]
*  Keanu Reeves [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9289.32s)]
*  exists. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9291.32s)]
*  It's over. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9293.32s)]
*  This is a guy that was influenced by DMX as a teenager. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9295.32s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9298.32s)]
*  To act like, come on, dog, [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9299.16s)]
*  to act like rappers are literally made up action heroes [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9300.66s)]
*  would then insult the integrity of rap. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9306.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9309.24s)]
*  So, cause guess what? [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9310.08s)]
*  It should be. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9311.36s)]
*  Hold on, so which one is it? [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9312.44s)]
*  Is Future and 21 Savage, are they Gangsta-licious? [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9314.08s)]
*  Are they John Wick or are they who they say they are? [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9317.64s)]
*  Which one? [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9320.76s)]
*  What's Gangsta-licious? [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9321.58s)]
*  From Boondocks. [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9322.42s)]
*  Which was a dude who was playing and portraying [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9323.56s)]
*  the role of a gangsta rapper, [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9326.68s)]
*  but it got defrauded throughout the episode. [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9328.519999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of that in the book. [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9330.6s)]
*  I agree, but what I'm saying is that you can't blame [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9332.359999999999s)]
*  the consumer for not seeing through the image [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9335.48s)]
*  that they've been presented and saying, [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9338.24s)]
*  well, y'all are just dumb, [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9339.84s)]
*  and absolving accountability of the person [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9341.279999999999s)]
*  who's perpetrating the fraud. [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9343.24s)]
*  That, to me, is crazy gaslighting. [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9345.199999999999s)]
*  But I think you can't blame the artist for saying, [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9347.0s)]
*  that's chapter one. [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9350.72s)]
*  You're putting out this message. [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9351.64s)]
*  No, dog. [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9352.48s)]
*  They didn't have the way of the zone to be like, [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9354.06s)]

*  I don't need to promote tequila on this podcast [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9397.34s)]

*  True. [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9404.140000000001s)]
*  So to act like Future's not telling people, [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9404.98s)]

*  If Future said, hey, I just wanted to let you guys know, [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9411.44s)]
*  this is a character that I play. [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9417.32s)]
*  He's never gonna say that. [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9419.04s)]

*  He would lose it all. [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9420.720000000001s)]
*  Two-year. [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9421.560000000001s)]
*  Oh, oh, oh, you've given your answer. [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9422.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9424.6s)]
*  So if Future can say, this is a character I play, [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9425.44s)]
*  I just want to let you know my character's future. [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9428.720000000001s)]
*  He does all this gangsters, he does all these drugs. [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9430.480000000001s)]
*  That's not who I am. [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9432.36s)]
*  I went to Cornell. [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9433.44s)]
*  I studied business in there and studied music, [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9434.68s)]
*  and I'm an amazing musician, [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9437.24s)]
*  and I just choose to play this character. [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9439.04s)]
*  Here's the music. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9440.92s)]
*  Do you think that his music would be more consumed [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9441.84s)]
*  or more popular if he was honest and said that, [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9444.12s)]
*  or if he was like, no, I am that character. [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9446.92s)]
*  This is who I am. [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9450.0s)]
*  You'll never see me break that character, [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9450.84s)]
*  and I do all those things. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9452.44s)]
*  What would make his music more successful? [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9453.28s)]
*  Is a magician so more attractive [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9455.32s)]
*  once you know how they do the tricks? [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9457.28s)]
*  No, he sucks once you know how to do the trick. [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9458.84s)]
*  No kidding. [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9459.8s)]
*  So exactly. [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9460.64s)]
*  They're never going to admit how they do. [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9461.84s)]
*  If that's the case, then he is profiting off of the illusion, [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9463.56s)]
*  whether the kids do it or not. [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9466.84s)]
*  Of course. [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9467.88s)]
*  There is more profit coming from the illusion. [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9468.72s)]
*  And he's not saying 100% of the blame is on the artist. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9471.76s)]
*  I'm not, I'm just saying that the fact that he can't absolve. [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9473.68s)]
*  But he can make more money doing it. [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9475.52s)]
*  This notion that there's no accountability [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9476.92s)]
*  for the person who's responsible [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9479.2s)]
*  for perpetuating the illusion is just gaslighting. [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9480.72s)]
*  It's like, it's you all who's fought for it, believe in it. [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9484.84s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9487.48s)]
*  Start at chapter one. [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9488.32s)]
*  Why are you perpetuating something you're not doing? [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9489.36s)]
*  Also, even if I think you're fake, I still want to do it. [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9491.92s)]
*  It's not all of his responsibility, [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9495.08s)]
*  but it's he's not absolved of any responsibility. [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9497.2s)]
*  I agree. [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9499.0s)]
*  What we're basically already doing. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9500.0s)]
*  It's a beautiful happy meeting. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9500.84s)]
*  What's the percentages? [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9502.72s)]
*  What we're doing is, and right now it feels like there's. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9504.56s)]
*  We're trying to figure out what the percentage. [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9506.52s)]
*  Is it 50, is it 49? [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9507.36s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9509.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9509.92s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9510.76s)]
*  But I think on social media, it's so extreme. [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9511.6s)]
*  It's like, it's all his fault, or it's none of his fault. [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9514.12s)]
*  The reality is it's like, look, both parties play a role. [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9517.28s)]
*  Everything's gonna play a role, [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9520.52s)]
*  and everybody's gonna have a little percentage. [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9521.6s)]
*  We just gotta figure out what it is. [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9522.92s)]
*  But even suggesting that there is a percentage, [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9523.880000000001s)]
*  I don't think is a bad thing. [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9526.24s)]
*  But I'm sure if I'm a label, [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9527.6s)]
*  I'm like, hey, don't start this. [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9530.52s)]
*  This is how we make our money. [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9531.36s)]
*  If I'm an artist, I'm like, yo, don't start this. [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9532.36s)]
*  This is how we make our money. [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9534.08s)]
*  I'm getting flamed. [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9535.16s)]

*  But think about what Russ gotta go through. [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9548.04s)]
*  Why are we allowing white people to speak on black culture? [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9550.28s)]

*  Completely separate conversation. [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9662.12s)]
*  Rick Rubin. [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9664.92s)]
*  I feel like Rick Rubin is having another wave, actually. [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9666.64s)]
*  Yeah, he's great. [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9669.76s)]
*  Well, that book he put out is a classic. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9670.6s)]
*  It's awesome. Is that why? [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9672.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's a classic. The book is great. [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9672.92s)]
*  I think. Oh, I gotta check this. [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9673.960000000001s)]
*  I think, yeah, the Creative Act is a classic. [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9675.28s)]
*  I just always find it so important [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9678.08s)]
*  for people with such strong set of beliefs [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9684.2s)]
*  and visions and ideas to put out a book, [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9688.2s)]
*  let alone an audio book. [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9691.92s)]
*  You can press play and just hear Rick Rubin. [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9693.08s)]
*  He could die tomorrow and you can just press play [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9695.560000000001s)]
*  and hear him talking about his belief system. [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9697.24s)]
*  Like, that's, to me, is so underrated. [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9700.24s)]
*  Yeah, the reason why he came up, [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9703.320000000002s)]
*  I thought that was your guru person [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9704.4s)]
*  that you were speaking to. [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9706.359999999999s)]
*  Yeah, no, but I mean, I listened to Rick Rubin [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9707.199999999999s)]
*  without him realizing I'm listening to him. [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9710.84s)]
*  Okay, so what does Rick Rubin do? [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9712.96s)]
*  For those of us that, he's synonymous with music, [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9714.64s)]
*  but we don't exactly know what he is doing. [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9717.8s)]
*  That's the guy in the room [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9720.359999999999s)]
*  who only has the purest intentions at heart, [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9722.48s)]
*  which is, I just want this to be the best thing it could be. [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9728.56s)]
*  And so, people in the music business [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9732.72s)]
*  have called him a reducer. [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9734.359999999999s)]
*  I think Kanye called him a reducer, not a producer. [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9735.759999999998s)]
*  You bring him in and he's just sort of like, nah. [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9739.08s)]
*  Cut that out. [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9741.039999999999s)]
*  That's a good, that's a good. [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9741.88s)]
*  He's just, I don't know, it's like, [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9743.039999999999s)]
*  you very rarely meet people who are the source. [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9744.48s)]
*  We talk about it, like me and Bibi Barelli, [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9750.08s)]
*  who I had her at the house for a month and a half [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9753.96s)]
*  when I was making Santiago. [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9757.16s)]
*  Who says Bibi Barelli? [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9758.32s)]
*  She's incredible. [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9759.279999999999s)]
*  She's the one who wrote, [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9760.12s)]
*  Bitch Better Have My Money by Rihanna. [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9760.960000000001s)]
*  She's an incredible songwriter, incredible songwriter. [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9762.68s)]
*  And she just gives so many gems in the studio. [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9766.240000000002s)]
*  And one of the terms she kept saying was the source [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9769.76s)]
*  and pure, source, pure, source, pure. [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9772.6s)]
*  And kind of how she puts it, and I agree, [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9775.800000000001s)]
*  it's like, there's people who are just the source. [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9778.320000000002s)]
*  They're the source of the sauce. [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9782.160000000002s)]
*  Like, they're in there just conjuring the ideas. [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9784.560000000001s)]
*  And then there's people who deliver the ideas. [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9788.36s)]
*  But there's people who no one knows who are like, [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9790.88s)]
*  we're the ones coming up with the ideas. [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9794.4s)]
*  Would you say Kanye is a source or? [[02:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9796.44s)]
*  I would say Kanye is a source. [[02:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9798.48s)]
*  I would also say Rick Rubin is a source. [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9799.68s)]
*  I think people like Sia, you know, the pop singer. [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9801.8s)]
*  She's a source. [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9805.84s)]
*  That's someone who people call on her [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9807.52s)]
*  to write their songs. [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9809.24s)]
*  The way I interpreted Rick from the book [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9811.08s)]
*  and just from one of his interviews, [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9812.64s)]
*  I'm curious what you think, [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9813.6s)]
*  is like, he seems like a creative psychologist. [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9814.44s)]
*  Or like a creative therapist. [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9818.92s)]
*  I agree. [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9819.76s)]
*  It's like creative self help. [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9820.58s)]
*  Yeah, like you're coming to him being like, [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9821.42s)]
*  look, I have all these ideas and I feel really strongly [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9822.84s)]
*  about these different things, [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9825.2s)]
*  but it's all kind of nebulous. [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9826.32s)]
*  And he would be like, [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9827.76s)]
*  this is where you should focus your energy. [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9828.84s)]
*  This is true. [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9830.68s)]
*  This energy you're feeling is honest [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9831.68s)]
*  and will connect with people. [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9833.16s)]
*  I'm always skeptical of these types of people, [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9834.4s)]
*  but I have so much respect for the people that admire him. [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9837.32s)]
*  So I give him that benefit of the doubt. [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9840.48s)]
*  He preaches all the time. [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9844.039999999999s)]
*  Anybody else, I'd be like, what's this hustle, bro? [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9845.36s)]
*  What do you think about therapists? [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9848.36s)]
*  I'm skeptical of a lot of them, [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9849.96s)]
*  but I've had a lot of benefit from a lot of them. [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9851.119999999999s)]
*  So I think there's good and bad ones. [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9853.16s)]
*  Isn't that how it goes with anyone? [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9855.32s)]
*  Absent of credentials, aren't you skeptical [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9857.64s)]
*  of anyone and everyone? [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9859.56s)]
*  Always. [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9860.64s)]
*  So it's like, yeah, Rick Rubin, absent of credentials. [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9861.48s)]
*  You're like, what is this hustle? [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9863.84s)]
*  I'm not skeptical if you could dump [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9864.68s)]
*  from the free throw line. [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9865.6s)]
*  I'm not skeptical if you're putting a 50. [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9866.6s)]
*  So it's like, if you know so much about making music. [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9868.48s)]
*  But Rick Rubin has tangible, like 99 problems [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9871.0s)]
*  and all these amazing. [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9875.28s)]
*  Jay had plenty of hits prior to that. [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9876.72s)]
*  No, of course, but once again, it's never. [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9878.880000000001s)]
*  Also, is he writing the music for it [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9881.36s)]
*  or is he there going, this is what? [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9883.0s)]
*  I think, you know what it is? [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9885.92s)]
*  It's tough for non-musicians to understand [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9887.36s)]
*  to understand the contribution that people [[02:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9889.64s)]
*  who maybe don't play an instrument [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9893.16s)]
*  or don't write lyrics have. [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9894.36s)]
*  Phil Jackson, I don't know if the Triangle Offense [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9896.68s)]
*  is that effective, but he can take the egos, the talent. [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9898.960000000001s)]
*  There was a time before the game moved [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9902.2s)]
*  to the three-point line, the Triangle Offense [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9904.56s)]
*  was incredibly effective. [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9906.4s)]
*  The game passed him by, but he was incredibly effective. [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9907.68s)]
*  But he was effective with the Lakers until 2011 [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9909.52s)]
*  was Kobe's last championship, 2010. [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9912.72s)]
*  But the three-point line didn't really change. [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9914.36s)]
*  The way that people shot threes has changed. [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9916.6s)]
*  But you understand my point. [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9918.4s)]
*  He takes the talent that can dump from the free throw line [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9919.24s)]
*  and he goes, here's how you win a championship. [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9921.32s)]
*  Jordan doesn't win one before. [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9922.72s)]
*  What I'm trying to say is I'm not trying [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9924.2s)]
*  to discredit his Xs and Os game. [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9925.68s)]
*  I don't wanna get too far off from this, [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9927.92s)]
*  but like the Triangle Offense was something [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9929.119999999999s)]
*  that was amazing. [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9932.4s)]
*  Now most NBA teams run one of two offenses. [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9933.84s)]
*  It's kind of the same thing. [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9936.32s)]
*  It's how you manage those players [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9937.2s)]
*  is what you're saying, but it was something novel [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9938.32s)]
*  and unique and really cool what he was doing. [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9940.2s)]
*  There was value to it. [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9942.04s)]
*  I think why I resonate with Rick Rubin so much [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9942.86s)]
*  is because he preaches authenticity [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9945.32s)]
*  and making music for you, the audience that is you, [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9949.14s)]
*  and doing it for that reason. [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9953.52s)]
*  And there is no such thing as writer's block [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9955.04s)]
*  because writer's block is either you [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9957.04s)]
*  not being good enough for yourself [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9959.36s)]
*  or you not being good enough for them. [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9960.8s)]
*  Just like there's a lot of things [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9962.599999999999s)]
*  that he just talks about that regardless [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9963.759999999998s)]
*  if he had credentials, what he's saying is the truth. [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9966.039999999999s)]
*  Got it. [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9969.119999999999s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9969.96s)]
*  Like some people, it doesn't matter. [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9970.779999999999s)]
*  I don't know y'all from a can of paint, right? [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9972.56s)]
*  But y'all can say things that are just the truth. [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9976.64s)]
*  It doesn't matter if I know y'all's resume. [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9979.679999999998s)]
*  And you know when you hear it. [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9981.4s)]
*  You know the truth. [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9982.24s)]
*  And I think the truth just rings out [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9983.599999999999s)]
*  regardless if there's a resume attached to it. [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9985.72s)]
*  I think also with him, it's just, [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9987.64s)]
*  it's somebody who's looking out for the artist, bro. [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9994.16s)]
*  It's like, I just feel like a lot of people [[02:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9996.48s)]
*  are not giving game on really, like you said, [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=9998.599999999999s)]
*  a self help for creatives. [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10001.96s)]
*  It's fucking incredible what he's doing. [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10003.96s)]
*  So I'm all for it. [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10005.84s)]
*  Yeah, I almost look at him like in a way [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10007.439999999999s)]
*  like Tony Robbins-ish. [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10009.26s)]
*  Right. [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10010.48s)]
*  Where it's like he can go into a business [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10011.32s)]
*  or work with an individual [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10012.14s)]
*  and all the people that have worked with him publicly [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10013.8s)]
*  to talk about him, Bill Clinton, you know, Agassi. [[02:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10016.76s)]
*  They're like, yo, this guy changed my life. [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10019.16s)]
*  He helped my business. [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10020.8s)]
*  He helped me see the world more clearly. [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10021.64s)]
*  And it seems like Rick does that for musicians. [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10023.439999999999s)]
*  And to add onto that, the contribution factor [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10025.84s)]
*  of someone who like, for people who don't make music, [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10029.359999999999s)]
*  it's, man, it would be so incredible [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10032.32s)]
*  to have somebody in the studio who's knowledgeable, [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10035.119999999999s)]
*  who's a visionary, who has great taste, [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10037.4s)]
*  who has no skin in the game. [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10039.679999999998s)]
*  Right. [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10041.24s)]
*  And who has no bias because I'm in there by myself [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10042.519999999999s)]
*  most of the time. [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10045.84s)]
*  And so I'm judging super hard. [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10047.04s)]
*  Or it's me and Boogie, it's my best friend. [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10049.32s)]
*  And like, we both just like love everything we do. [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10050.960000000001s)]
*  And yeah, certain songs get this reaction, [[02:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10054.0s)]
*  certain songs get, but still, [[02:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10056.76s)]
*  it's like to have somebody sorta over here [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10058.04s)]
*  who's like, I don't fucking know y'all at all. [[02:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10060.6s)]
*  This is the one, this isn't the one. [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10063.4s)]
*  Like when I met Rick Rubin in 2016, went to his house, [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10064.44s)]
*  and we drove in his car. [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10069.56s)]
*  He was driving, I never, he was like a white Range Rover. [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10071.68s)]
*  We were driving down PCH, and I'm playing him songs. [[02:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10074.36s)]
*  And I play him a bunch of songs, [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10078.16s)]
*  and I get to What They Want. [[02:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10080.08s)]
*  And I don't know if What They Want had come out yet. [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10081.68s)]
*  But for context, like What They Want [[02:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10084.56s)]
*  is like five times platinum now. [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10085.76s)]
*  And I remember playing it, [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10087.64s)]
*  a bunch of songs from What They Want comes on, [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10088.76s)]
*  and he just instantly like ears perk up, [[02:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10090.56s)]
*  and he's like, this is the one. [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10092.44s)]
*  Oh wow. [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10094.119999999999s)]
*  And this is like, you know, this dude at that time was, [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10094.96s)]
*  and it's probably in his 50s, [[02:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10097.96s)]
*  so it's like not quote unquote tapped in to the youth [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10099.76s)]
*  what would work with the youth. [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10103.4s)]
*  I was 22, 23 at the time. [[02:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10105.08s)]
*  I remember listening to that song [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10106.64s)]
*  and being so upset you were white. [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10107.72s)]
*  And I couldn't believe this white. [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10109.359999999999s)]
*  But he was like, Rick Rubin was like, yeah, this is the one. [[02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10112.44s)]
*  You know, and it's just like. [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10115.88s)]
*  You know you can do that with a premise? [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10117.039999999999s)]
*  Like you can hear a premise now at this point in time, [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10118.16s)]
*  and you go, that's a great, that's a great. [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10120.08s)]
*  I feel like I could do that with music, no bullshit. [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10121.96s)]
*  I think. [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10124.16s)]
*  I mean dead ass. [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10125.0s)]
*  Like, I think if you play me out, [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10125.84s)]
*  yeah, this isn't a single. [[02:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10128.08s)]
*  Well here's the thing that he preaches, [[02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10129.16s)]
*  which like, no, but here's the thing that he preaches [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10131.52s)]
*  which I absolutely subscribe to [[02:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10133.68s)]
*  because it just feels like the truth, which is. [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10135.4s)]
*  How hard is it? [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10138.16s)]
*  Like they make the decision for you. [[02:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10139.0s)]
*  But you're right, you're right. [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10141.24s)]
*  Because guess what he talks about. [[02:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10142.16s)]
*  He talks about it in his Jay Shetty interview. [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10143.560000000001s)]
*  When you take a bite of food, [[02:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10145.800000000001s)]
*  how long does it take for you to say do I like it or not? [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10146.960000000001s)]
*  It's instant. [[02:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10149.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I like it. [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10150.52s)]
*  Same shit with music. [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10151.52s)]
*  He was like, it's just taste. [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10152.880000000001s)]
*  I don't have to think about whether I like it or not. [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10154.92s)]
*  And so Rick Rubin has gotten to where he is [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10157.08s)]
*  off of his taste. [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10159.16s)]
*  And to me, that is the flyest shit ever. [[02:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10160.08s)]
*  That dude has gotten there. [[02:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10164.76s)]
*  So you would love Rick Rubin is the point. [[02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10165.6s)]
*  Bro, you would love. [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10167.12s)]
*  I think I would. [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10168.68s)]
*  I just, I am oftentimes skeptical [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10169.52s)]
*  when I hear about these figures [[02:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10172.16s)]
*  and the way that they're described, right? [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10173.72s)]
*  Because what a lot of times I think that they're, [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10175.84s)]
*  like for example, it's really nice to have somebody [[02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10177.92s)]
*  when you're an artist tell you what you're doing is great [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10181.24s)]
*  when all the other people around you [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10185.88s)]
*  are trying to monetize you. [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10187.68s)]
*  So when the label is trying to make money off this [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10189.960000000001s)]
*  and the studio is trying to make money off this [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10191.84s)]
*  and the people at the recordings [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10193.32s)]
*  is trying to make money off this. [[02:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10194.6s)]
*  And then someone who doesn't need your money [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10195.560000000001s)]
*  because he's a multimillionaire so many times over [[02:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10197.16s)]
*  comes over and he's like, no, I like this one here. [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10199.4s)]
*  You go, oh, there's honesty here. [[02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10201.640000000001s)]
*  So I understand the comfort that must come from that [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10204.640000000001s)]
*  and also the validation from someone [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10206.52s)]
*  that we always respect. [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10208.08s)]
*  It's just learning about what that actual skill is. [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10209.640000000001s)]
*  I'm ignorant to him. [[02:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10212.28s)]
*  The only thing I know is that people that I respect [[02:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10214.44s)]
*  really respect him. [[02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10216.84s)]
*  He also started Def Jam, [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10218.039999999999s)]
*  which was the first hip hop label. [[02:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10220.359999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10222.0s)]

*  what the actual tangible thing is [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10225.32s)]
*  and this creative consultant having taste. [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10226.8s)]
*  Like taste is huge. [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10228.96s)]
*  Taste is everything. [[02:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10230.16s)]

*  is because your taste says they're funny. [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10236.359999999999s)]
*  And the reason why you're huge is because [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10238.519999999999s)]
*  there's a lot of other people who say, [[02:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10240.32s)]

*  That's taste. [[02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10245.92s)]
*  Understanding what people want. [[02:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10247.0s)]
*  It's like understanding culture and understanding feeling. [[02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10248.0s)]
*  That's taste. [[02:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10250.199999999999s)]
*  And when you have taste, [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10251.039999999999s)]

*  Right. [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10253.199999999999s)]

*  No, but he's just become a guy [[03:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10823.88s)]
*  that's like inspired by the last YouTube video he watches. [[03:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10825.96s)]
*  And that's just the only bullshit he regurgitates. [[03:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10828.96s)]
*  And then once you see that, [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10830.96s)]
*  it's just hard to take anything else seriously. [[03:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10832.439999999999s)]
*  Like when I see him going on these rants, [[03:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10834.519999999999s)]
*  it's like, oh yeah, [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10835.88s)]
*  I too have stumbled across these videos on YouTube. [[03:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10837.08s)]
*  And I have chosen not to regurgitate this information [[03:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10840.24s)]
*  or at least fact check it. [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10843.48s)]
*  And he's just not. [[03:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10844.439999999999s)]
*  And I also know some people [[03:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10845.439999999999s)]
*  that he was like getting game from [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10846.72s)]
*  that basically had to like hit him up afterwards [[03:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10848.439999999999s)]
*  and be like, we were just talking theoretically [[03:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10850.800000000001s)]
*  about these things, Kanye. [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10854.08s)]
*  Like I spoke to a dude that he literally went on TMZ [[03:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10856.24s)]
*  after talking to and spit all the shit. [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10859.32s)]
*  No, no, he went on TMZ after he spoke to this guy. [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10862.28s)]
*  And it was just like, and then he's talking to him. [[03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10865.0s)]
*  And it's just like, oh yeah. [[03:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10867.72s)]
*  So nothing you say is thought about at all. [[03:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10868.960000000001s)]
*  You just heard something sticky or provocative [[03:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10872.44s)]
*  or whatever it is you do. [[03:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10874.64s)]
*  You know what I'm trying to do though now? [[03:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10876.2s)]
*  I think after being like scrutinizing the media heavy [[03:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10877.72s)]
*  is like just deploy more empathy. [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10881.039999999999s)]
*  That's it. [[03:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10884.279999999999s)]
*  Like that doesn't mean that I'm absolving people [[03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10885.119999999999s)]
*  of like fucked up shit they're saying. [[03:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10886.96s)]
*  It's more so like before I go to shame, [[03:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10888.88s)]
*  which is what I would usually go to for myself especially, [[03:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10892.199999999999s)]
*  it's like, where are you at? [[03:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10895.8s)]
*  And I think that that's just a much more productive opening. [[03:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10898.96s)]
*  So yeah, I don't know. [[03:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10903.279999999999s)]
*  It's like two, three, four years ago, [[03:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10905.16s)]
*  what the fuck is wrong? [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10909.880000000001s)]
*  More so now like, damn, like I wonder what's going on. [[03:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10911.6s)]
*  That's it. [[03:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10915.880000000001s)]
*  Mental illness. [[03:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10916.72s)]
*  Curiosity question, who's Lucian Grange? [[03:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10917.56s)]
*  Who is he and what's his power in the music industry? [[03:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10921.36s)]
*  I believe he owns UMG, Universal. [[03:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10925.24s)]
*  But the way people speak about him is like, [[03:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10928.36s)]
*  he's pulling all the strings. [[03:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10931.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's just like a popular name. [[03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10933.960000000001s)]
*  I mean, he just owns a massive, [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10935.56s)]
*  so there's Universal, Warner, Sony, [[03:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10938.04s)]
*  and whoever, I don't know, we've been drinking. [[03:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10942.84s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, there's people who are just CEOs [[03:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10945.0s)]
*  of these massive labels and companies [[03:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10948.28s)]
*  and they are in power, [[03:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10950.160000000002s)]
*  but it's like he's just like an attractive popular name. [[03:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10952.28s)]
*  Who is the most powerful person in music? [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10955.44s)]
*  Probably the people in Japan who actually own the shit. [[03:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10958.240000000002s)]
*  Who does that mean? [[03:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10962.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, like certain, when I was with Columbia, [[03:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10963.6s)]
*  certain deals, they went above, [[03:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10967.12s)]
*  so like Columbia has a CEO, but Columbia's part of Sony. [[03:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10971.800000000001s)]
*  Sony has a CEO, but above that is the dude in Japan [[03:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10976.04s)]
*  who owns all of this. [[03:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10980.480000000001s)]
*  See, now we talking. [[03:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10982.12s)]
*  So certain deals, they were above the CEO of Columbia [[03:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10983.560000000001s)]
*  and they were above the CEO of Sony. [[03:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10986.84s)]
*  It had to get approval from the dude in Japan. [[03:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10988.44s)]
*  And how did you do that? [[03:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10990.480000000001s)]
*  Well, it just goes up the pipeline [[03:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10992.36s)]
*  and they just run numbers. [[03:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10994.960000000001s)]
*  And then they just go, [[03:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10996.2s)]
*  like is this a good investment or not? [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10997.04s)]
*  Did you ever meet that dude? [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10997.880000000001s)]
*  No, no, no. [[03:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10999.080000000002s)]
*  You ever talk to him? [[03:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=10999.92s)]
*  Did you ever meet him? [[03:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11000.76s)]
*  That's why it's so, I don't know. [[03:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11001.6s)]
*  It's like thinking that the fucking head coach [[03:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11007.400000000001s)]
*  has that much say. [[03:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11011.400000000001s)]
*  That's the face of the shit, bro. [[03:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11014.52s)]
*  Jerry Jones is calling the shots. [[03:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11016.6s)]
*  Yeah, and he's not gonna die anytime soon, unfortunately. [[03:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11018.320000000002s)]
*  No, it's like, and I don't know enough about football [[03:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11020.960000000001s)]
*  to know it's like, there's probably someone above him. [[03:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11025.52s)]
*  There might be a board of people [[03:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11028.560000000001s)]
*  who gave Jerry Jones the money. [[03:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11029.720000000001s)]
*  The devil himself. [[03:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11031.560000000001s)]
*  No, but it's like. [[03:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11032.400000000001s)]
*  Fucking asshole. [[03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11033.44s)]
*  No, but it's, bro, it's the same way politics works. [[03:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11034.28s)]
*  Fuck you, Jerry Jones. [[03:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11036.320000000002s)]
*  It's the same way politics works. [[03:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11037.480000000001s)]
*  It's like Biden or Trump is the face, [[03:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11038.800000000001s)]
*  but there's a board of people who invested. [[03:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11041.560000000001s)]
*  And so it's like, those are the ones [[03:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11043.880000000001s)]
*  who really are calling the shots [[03:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11045.0s)]
*  because it's like we invested, so you need to do X, Y, and Z. [[03:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11046.36s)]
*  Same shit with the people in Japan [[03:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11049.36s)]
*  who actually own Sony as a company, not just the music. [[03:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11051.12s)]
*  Is that why you're afraid to call them odd? [[03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11055.32s)]
*  Is that why you call them interesting? [[03:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11057.32s)]
*  What a segue. [[03:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11059.4s)]
*  Because they fucking sign the checks? [[03:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11060.44s)]
*  Is that what's going on? [[03:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11062.28s)]
*  No, I have no association with them. [[03:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11063.12s)]
*  Because I just want to apologize to all of you out there. [[03:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11065.04s)]
*  I realize you guys owned everything. [[03:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11067.68s)]
*  When you start thinking macro, it's like, [[03:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11069.12s)]
*  a record label is just one of the arms of Sony. [[03:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11072.56s)]
*  Sony also makes PlayStations. [[03:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11076.76s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[03:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11078.56s)]

*  that entity in and of itself is one artist. [[03:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11087.52s)]
*  PlayStation is one artist. [[03:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11092.36s)]

*  Getting inspired. [[03:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11127.4s)]
*  I'm at a koi pond eating fucking tapen yaki, [[03:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11128.24s)]

*  Have you ever had a run-in with? [[03:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11140.96s)]
*  No. [[03:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11142.720000000001s)]
*  I've talked to his son before, [[03:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11143.56s)]
*  but yeah, I've never met him. [[03:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11145.76s)]
*  How much control and power do they have? [[03:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11147.6s)]
*  I have no clue. [[03:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11149.720000000001s)]
*  Seems like they have a lot. [[03:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11150.720000000001s)]
*  I know what y'all know. [[03:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11151.56s)]
*  Outside looking in, seems like they have a lot. [[03:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11152.76s)]
*  But you talked to his son. [[03:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11154.84s)]
*  I'm sure you've shared things. [[03:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11155.68s)]
*  No, it was just literally a DM who's like, what's up? [[03:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11157.6s)]
*  Oh, appreciate you. [[03:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11160.16s)]

*  No. [[03:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11164.32s)]
*  What? [[03:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11165.16s)]
*  He just doesn't make, [[03:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11166.0s)]
*  I don't think he makes music that operates in that world. [[03:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11166.82s)]
*  I'm not doing it. [[03:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11167.66s)]
*  The other thing is, it's not a question, but. [[03:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11168.5s)]
*  He operates in hip hop. [[03:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11169.56s)]
*  No, I know, but it's like, [[03:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11170.64s)]
*  if you're moving around claiming to be the big bad wolf, [[03:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11172.119999999999s)]
*  or there's other big bad wolf. [[03:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11177.199999999999s)]
*  So when you go to a city that you're not from, [[03:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11179.039999999999s)]
*  and there's other big bad wolf, it just makes sense. [[03:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11181.92s)]
*  You'd be like, hey, big bad wolf, I'm also here. [[03:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11183.72s)]
*  Can we coexist? [[03:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11186.4s)]
*  Who explained this? [[03:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11187.359999999999s)]
*  Just like basic, that to me is like basic courtesy. [[03:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11188.199999999999s)]
*  Who is it? [[03:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11193.439999999999s)]
*  Is that not basic courtesy? [[03:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11194.46s)]
*  No, it is, but I'm just saying. [[03:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11195.96s)]
*  So I thought they just have control over. [[03:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11197.08s)]
*  An embargo on a no-fly zone. [[03:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11199.359999999999s)]
*  Yeah, any hip hop artists that are performing here, [[03:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11201.68s)]
*  you gotta check in with them. [[03:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11204.28s)]
*  I've done numerous shows in Houston, [[03:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11205.960000000001s)]
*  it was completely fine. [[03:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11207.320000000002s)]
*  The etymology of this is that back in the day, [[03:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11208.52s)]
*  hip hop artists could usually only perform [[03:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11210.960000000001s)]
*  in one venue in a city, [[03:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11213.720000000001s)]
*  and that venue was owned by the local drug dealer. [[03:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11215.400000000001s)]
*  So now you had to do a deal with the local drug dealer, [[03:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11218.26s)]
*  and if you didn't come with your guys, [[03:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11221.36s)]
*  a local drug dealer who was paying you all cash, [[03:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11222.76s)]
*  who was basically trying to clean his drug money, [[03:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11225.04s)]
*  knew exactly where you were staying, [[03:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11227.320000000002s)]
*  and you might get hit for your shit [[03:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11228.84s)]
*  on the way out of the venue. [[03:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11230.48s)]
*  So you had your guys reach out to them and say, hey. [[03:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11231.84s)]
*  That's multilayered. [[03:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11235.199999999999s)]
*  That's a lot. [[03:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11236.279999999999s)]
*  So that's checking in. [[03:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11237.119999999999s)]
*  So it's basically like, [[03:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11237.96s)]
*  yo, am I gonna be good making this money? [[03:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11238.8s)]
*  Because back in the day, [[03:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11240.24s)]
*  rap artists weren't getting to play in the fucking arenas [[03:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11241.16s)]
*  or the crazy venues or whatever. [[03:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11243.76s)]
*  I think it's different depending on the music you make. [[03:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11246.08s)]
*  When I did Hollywood Bowl and I wanted to bring out YG, [[03:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11249.14s)]
*  and he hit me, he was like, man, the venue's tripping [[03:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11252.52s)]
*  because of who I am and what I'm associated with. [[03:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11256.359999999999s)]
*  They're not letting me, long story short, [[03:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11258.800000000001s)]
*  he ended up being fine, [[03:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11261.04s)]
*  but it's like, they didn't give me a hard time. [[03:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11261.880000000001s)]
*  They gave him. [[03:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11263.880000000001s)]
*  They gave him a hard time. [[03:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11264.72s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[03:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11265.68s)]
*  So I think it just kinda depends [[03:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11266.52s)]
*  on what the perception of you is. [[03:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11268.12s)]
*  Do you have to move around with security? [[03:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11270.84s)]
*  I move around with security because it's smart, [[03:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11272.52s)]
*  because I stopped thinking that it couldn't happen to me. [[03:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11275.300000000001s)]
*  And also because after 2018, [[03:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11280.44s)]
*  when there was a lot of media hate and cultural hate, [[03:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11282.44s)]
*  I was just paranoid. [[03:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11288.36s)]
*  I'm just like, I just started feeling. [[03:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11291.08s)]
*  You're also running up on people that talk shit. [[03:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11292.92s)]
*  Right, so I'm just like, bro, [[03:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11294.16s)]
*  I would be dumb to think that somebody, [[03:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11295.720000000001s)]
*  that all of these are just baseless threats. [[03:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11298.640000000001s)]
*  So let me move smart so that, God forbid, [[03:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11302.140000000001s)]
*  anything happens, so yeah. [[03:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11305.04s)]
*  Oh yeah, are you still moving like that? [[03:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11306.84s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[03:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11308.16s)]
*  No, but running up on people that you run with? [[03:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11309.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no, I was never moving like that. [[03:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11310.36s)]
*  Yo, that shit works though, huh? [[03:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11313.76s)]
*  No, but I wasn't like, I mean, it's. [[03:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11319.84s)]
*  Say Connie Boy, say Connie Boy. [[03:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11323.36s)]
*  I was never doing it. [[03:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11328.2s)]
*  Violence works though, huh? [[03:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11330.2s)]
*  I think it's actually sad. [[03:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11332.400000000001s)]
*  It's an unfortunate reality that the language [[03:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11335.08s)]
*  that some people speak is money or violence. [[03:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11336.92s)]
*  Yep. [[03:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11339.2s)]
*  Fire to put it on them. [[03:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11340.16s)]
*  It's true, it's true. [[03:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11342.84s)]
*  It actually like exposes the, [[03:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11344.76s)]
*  it exposes the nuts in people. [[03:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11350.0s)]
*  How much do you really believe what you're saying? [[03:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11353.4s)]
*  So it's like, you're ballsy enough to say something online, [[03:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11356.16s)]
*  but you're not ballsy enough to really. [[03:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11360.24s)]
*  Throw down when it happens. [[03:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11364.4s)]
*  In person, and there was a time where I was just, [[03:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11365.44s)]
*  I fell victim to myself and my rage [[03:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11372.16s)]
*  of wanting to stop being fucked with. [[03:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11376.12s)]
*  And so I was like, bro, enough is enough. [[03:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11379.52s)]
*  Whenever I see any of y'all, like, fuck y'all. [[03:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11381.32s)]
*  So that's just what, yeah, [[03:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11386.32s)]
*  because have y'all seen anyone say anything since? [[03:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11388.4s)]
*  Isn't that interesting? [[03:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11390.36s)]
*  No, but. [[03:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11391.6s)]
*  Isn't that interesting? [[03:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11392.44s)]
*  No, but that's what I'm saying. [[03:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11393.28s)]
*  Everyone speaks violence. [[03:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11394.96s)]
*  Everyone does. [[03:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11397.52s)]
*  Everyone understands that language. [[03:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11398.36s)]
*  And it's fucked up. [[03:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11400.2s)]
*  It's like, damn, y'all just weren't spanked as a kid. [[03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11401.04s)]
*  Because why did, I don't know. [[03:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11405.52s)]
*  It's just like, I'm not gonna say when I was 17 or 18, [[03:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11407.640000000001s)]
*  I wasn't on Twitter talking shit as a nobody, [[03:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11411.160000000002s)]
*  but it's like, I have never, [[03:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11413.640000000001s)]
*  I have never talked shit since getting on [[03:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11416.28s)]

*  What's the antithesis of intelligent movement? [[03:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11716.82s)]
*  Crackhead. [[03:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11720.18s)]
*  Being reckless. [[03:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11721.02s)]
*  Reckless. [[03:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11721.86s)]
*  Okay. [[03:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11722.68s)]
*  We're like, kinda close. [[03:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11723.52s)]
*  Well no, no, to your point, I wanna. [[03:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11725.58s)]
*  Everything right now, like why the old heads are like, [[03:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11727.58s)]
*  hip hop is dying is because what is happening [[03:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11730.9s)]
*  is counterculture to the culture of hip hop's inception. [[03:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11734.06s)]
*  Okay, we would agree. [[03:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11738.06s)]
*  The shit happening in hip hop is actually [[03:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11738.9s)]
*  counterculture in the culture is hip hop. [[03:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11742.22s)]
*  To the counterculture, I'm curious about this, okay. [[03:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11744.78s)]
*  Hip hop, I don't think had a number one album last year. [[03:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11747.82s)]
*  Right, until whatever it was, yeah. [[03:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11750.62s)]
*  There is a form of music that has gained [[03:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11755.42s)]
*  mainstream popularity. What you say, I saw this [[03:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11758.7s)]
*  and I sent it to the group chat, it was so spot on. [[03:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11760.34s)]
*  I'm curious your take on it, and is country, [[03:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11762.54s)]
*  this rebellion that you're talking about, [[03:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11765.460000000001s)]
*  is this counterculture, if the mainstream culture, [[03:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11767.34s)]
*  if everybody's listening to hip hop and hip hop is, [[03:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11769.58s)]
*  it might not be representative of every single person [[03:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11771.74s)]
*  in America, but it is popular music now, [[03:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11773.94s)]
*  is country now the most rebellious or counterculture thing [[03:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11776.78s)]
*  to hip hop, and is that why it's become so popular? [[03:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11780.26s)]
*  I think this. [[03:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11783.900000000001s)]
*  I think it's not that black and white, [[03:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11784.900000000001s)]
*  but I think there's a couple things. [[03:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11787.62s)]
*  I think it happened with rock music, which is, [[03:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11789.2s)]
*  subject matter in rock music reached the ceiling, [[03:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11792.62s)]
*  where we had heard everything. [[03:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11797.18s)]
*  And I think with rap, we have heard everything. [[03:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11799.54s)]
*  Oh, you're also sliding on an op? [[03:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11803.44s)]
*  Heard that. [[03:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11805.54s)]
*  In fact, I heard it and it was better. [[03:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11806.62s)]
*  If you're selling drugs, I heard that. [[03:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11809.54s)]
*  50 did it and it was way harder. [[03:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11811.34s)]
*  You're sad, you're emotional. [[03:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11812.78s)]
*  You're sad, heard that. [[03:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11814.060000000001s)]
*  Cuddy, way better. [[03:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11815.460000000001s)]
*  Drey, you know what I'm saying, it's like, [[03:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11816.74s)]
*  everything that's happening in rap, [[03:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11818.800000000001s)]
*  I've already heard the better version of it. [[03:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11820.54s)]
*  So what haven't we heard yet? [[03:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11822.3s)]
*  So it's reached this point of, we've heard of this. [[03:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11823.9s)]
*  It's like at this sort of breaking point [[03:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11829.3s)]
*  where what's about to happen, and that's one layer of it. [[03:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11830.94s)]
*  I think the other layer is people who listen [[03:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11834.58s)]
*  to country and rock, they weren't on the streaming [[03:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11837.38s)]
*  platforms at first, they were still on iTunes. [[03:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11839.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11841.26s)]
*  Right? [[03:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11842.1s)]
*  They were still buying CDs. [[03:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11842.92s)]
*  They were still buying CDs. [[03:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11843.76s)]
*  They've migrated over where now, my dad is on Spotify. [[03:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11844.82s)]
*  See what I'm saying? [[03:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11851.14s)]
*  That was the last number of music that was still buying. [[03:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11852.22s)]
*  Right, so now you're getting the audience [[03:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11854.9s)]
*  that was basically, country music's audience, [[03:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11856.9s)]
*  in my opinion, was last to migrate to streaming. [[03:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11859.98s)]
*  But now that they have, people are seeing that, [[03:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11862.7s)]
*  wow, there's a lot of them. [[03:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11865.18s)]
*  Think about it. [[03:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11867.9s)]
*  So it's not necessarily a rebellion. [[03:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11868.74s)]
*  There's a lot of them in America. [[03:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11870.82s)]
*  Just that they were the last ones to convert. [[03:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11872.34s)]
*  To migrate. [[03:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11874.46s)]
*  And because of the conversion of migration, [[03:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11875.3s)]
*  now we're seeing these numbers that look astronomical, [[03:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11877.7s)]
*  but those were always the fucking numbers. [[03:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11880.7s)]
*  They were always there. [[03:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11883.14s)]
*  That's interesting. [[03:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11883.98s)]
*  They were always there. [[03:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11884.82s)]
*  Kenny Kennedy had been moving years. [[03:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11885.66s)]
*  Yeah, they were always there. [[03:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11886.5s)]
*  They were just last to the party. [[03:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11887.539999999999s)]
*  They always had their own awards show that was huge. [[03:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11888.38s)]
*  They were just last to the party, [[03:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11891.06s)]
*  is all that happened, in my opinion. [[03:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11892.539999999999s)]
*  But also, I do think rap's subject matter [[03:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11893.98s)]
*  has reached a ceiling where there's no new perspectives [[03:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11897.18s)]
*  being introduced outside of the select few, [[03:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11900.9s)]
*  which is why I like, I know a lot of people [[03:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11904.42s)]
*  have flacked for Kendrick's most recent album, [[03:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11906.3s)]
*  but in my opinion, Father Time is one of the greatest songs [[03:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11908.019999999999s)]
*  released in the past 10 years, [[03:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11912.699999999999s)]
*  because I've never heard a mainstream rapper talk about, [[03:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11915.74s)]
*  and I could be wrong, right? [[03:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11921.179999999998s)]
*  I don't wanna say that this is the God's honest truth, [[03:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11922.859999999999s)]
*  but I just have never heard a mainstream rapper [[03:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11926.539999999999s)]
*  talk about father issues in that light. [[03:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11928.699999999999s)]
*  I thought it was fucking profound. [[03:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11931.539999999999s)]
*  I've heard mother issues and all that. [[03:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11933.42s)]
*  Or child abuse. [[03:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11935.259999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, I think introducing new concepts [[03:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11936.86s)]
*  into the lexicon of rap is powerful. [[03:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11944.34s)]
*  And if you don't like the sound of it, [[03:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11948.54s)]
*  that's fine, that's fair, that's taste, [[03:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11951.1s)]
*  but I respect that, and that's why I did Santiago, [[03:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11953.06s)]
*  was because, honestly, Kendrick's album, [[03:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11955.74s)]
*  and really Father Time inspired me to speak on my issues, [[03:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11958.380000000001s)]
*  because I was like, oh, you know, [[03:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11964.34s)]
*  so it's safe to do that? [[03:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11965.939999999999s)]
*  And then I think I also talked about shit [[03:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11967.3s)]
*  that's never been talked about before. [[03:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11969.82s)]
*  This is all forms of art. [[03:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11971.939999999999s)]
*  Once people see that it can be done, [[03:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11973.46s)]
*  they feel way more comfortable doing it themselves as well. [[03:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11977.06s)]
*  They just can't conceptualize talking about [[03:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11980.859999999999s)]
*  an abusive childhood or a relationship with their parents, [[03:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11983.38s)]
*  which they might also have, [[03:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11985.82s)]
*  but they're too locked in this game of, [[03:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11987.3s)]
*  how can I replicate what's successful? [[03:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11989.74s)]
*  Once you make something else successful, [[03:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11991.5s)]
*  they start going, well, I would also like [[03:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11993.06s)]
*  to try to do that. [[03:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11995.82s)]
*  Sure. [[03:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11996.66s)]
*  The labels are hanging on by a thread. [[03:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11997.5s)]
*  I'll tell you this. [[03:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11998.9s)]
*  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. [[03:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=11999.74s)]
*  The labels are not going to allow rap [[03:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12000.619999999999s)]
*  to fall by the wayside like that. [[03:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12002.98s)]
*  They're gonna keep boosting and juicing the stream [[03:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12005.5s)]
*  so that it appears that, what are y'all talking about? [[03:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12008.019999999999s)]
*  Rap's not losing steam. [[03:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12011.14s)]
*  There's country, sure, but we're still crushing. [[03:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12012.699999999999s)]
*  No, you're not. [[03:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12015.5s)]
*  Wow. [[03:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12016.619999999999s)]
*  You're having to spend a lot of money [[03:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12017.46s)]
*  to keep up the facade. [[03:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12018.779999999999s)]
*  This is a star is born. [[03:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12020.66s)]
*  What is the Lady Gaga movie? [[03:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12024.1s)]
*  It's that. [[03:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12025.42s)]
*  Star is born, yeah. [[03:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12026.26s)]
*  It's right now, the labels are doing everything they can [[03:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12027.1s)]
*  to keep the makeup and the wig and the choreography going [[03:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12032.26s)]
*  so that it looks like shit is popping, [[03:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12036.1s)]
*  but it's not. [[03:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12038.62s)]
*  It's not. [[03:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12040.34s)]
*  And how does that end? [[03:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12041.18s)]
*  Do they run out of money? [[03:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12042.140000000001s)]
*  I think it's like every genre. [[03:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12043.5s)]
*  I think, bro, to be honest, once again, [[03:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12045.18s)]
*  the truth is born, right? [[03:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12048.9s)]
*  Here's the truth. [[03:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12050.1s)]
*  You know what it is? [[03:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12050.94s)]
*  Four years ago, every CEO was signing [[03:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12051.900000000001s)]
*  every SoundCloud rapper and their cousin. [[03:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12055.78s)]
*  You know what they're about to do? [[03:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12058.060000000001s)]
*  Sign every country artist and their cousin. [[03:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12059.66s)]
*  And guess what? [[03:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12062.1s)]
*  The country artists, like we talked about before, [[03:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12063.140000000001s)]
*  they'll make enough money to cover the loss [[03:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12065.300000000001s)]
*  of the rappers that they're still fronting. [[03:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12067.380000000001s)]
*  And so it doesn't matter. [[03:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12070.220000000001s)]
*  It'll always look like rap's still doing its thing, [[03:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12071.1s)]
*  country's booming, yeah, but rap is still crushing. [[03:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12074.5s)]
*  Yeah, but y'all are signing the country artists. [[03:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12077.78s)]
*  I know, because I'm talking to the fucking, [[03:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12079.140000000001s)]
*  I still have relationships with the people at the labels [[03:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12080.98s)]
*  and some of them are good people [[03:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12083.5s)]
*  and we talk about it all the time where it's like, [[03:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12085.14s)]
*  the whole focus is country artists. [[03:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12087.46s)]
*  My theory is every. [[03:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12089.779999999999s)]
*  The whole focus is, look at Morgan Wallen, bro. [[03:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12090.619999999999s)]
*  Are you kidding? [[03:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12093.779999999999s)]
*  He uses some words rappers use. [[03:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12095.02s)]
*  Ah! [[03:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12096.779999999999s)]
*  Bro, Morgan Wallen, [[03:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12097.619999999999s)]
*  bro, Morgan Wallen, Jelly Roll. [[03:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12099.66s)]
*  Shout out Jelly. [[03:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12102.779999999999s)]
*  Yo, that's the man. [[03:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12103.619999999999s)]
*  Bailey Zimmerman, like all these dudes who are like, [[03:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12104.46s)]
*  dudes and women who are coming through this vessel [[03:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12107.82s)]
*  of this singer-songwriter, country twang, [[03:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12111.94s)]
*  alternative sort of space. [[03:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12114.26s)]
*  That's who the labels are scooping up [[03:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12116.42s)]
*  like they were doing six years ago with like, [[03:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12118.060000000001s)]
*  Lil T.J. and Polo G and all those kind of guys. [[03:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12120.300000000001s)]
*  It's like, that's what they're on now. [[03:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12123.26s)]
*  It's musical chairs, bro. [[03:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12125.66s)]
*  It's like, thinking that these people [[03:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12127.5s)]
*  actually give a fuck about you is a mistake. [[03:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12129.1s)]
*  Now, now, now, real quick. [[03:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12131.42s)]
*  If rap starts to, let's say, struggle [[03:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12133.34s)]
*  and views and streams are harder to come by. [[03:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12136.9s)]
*  Do you think that rappers will resort [[03:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12140.9s)]
*  to more extreme tactics in order to garner those views [[03:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12143.9s)]
*  or streams and that's how the art becomes, [[03:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12147.380000000001s)]
*  the crackhead doing all these crazy things [[03:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12151.94s)]
*  or the slide on the ops gets even crazier. [[03:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12153.78s)]
*  I need to do something even crazier in order [[03:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12155.5s)]
*  to get the reaction that I did before. [[03:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12158.34s)]
*  Yes, but also it's like labels, [[03:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12160.18s)]
*  I think labels are going to. [[03:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12162.66s)]
*  Go ahead, you got something, Blaynard. [[03:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12164.5s)]
*  Yeah, you got it. [[03:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12167.86s)]
*  Get a fuck. [[03:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12168.7s)]
*  I think labels are going to continue to prop up rap [[03:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12169.54s)]
*  to attract newcomers. [[03:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12176.140000000001s)]
*  Because, put it like this, right? [[03:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12179.380000000001s)]
*  Labels letting rap fall is a bad idea for them [[03:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12181.740000000002s)]
*  because now where the up and coming rapper's gonna go to. [[03:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12187.1s)]
*  They're gonna feel like, well, no, [[03:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12191.1s)]
*  I'm not gonna go over there. [[03:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12192.980000000001s)]
*  I'm not gonna sign because all these rappers are falling off. [[03:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12193.820000000002s)]
*  But if you keep seeing rappers doing crazy numbers, [[03:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12196.42s)]
*  you're like, all right, so there's still a place for us. [[03:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12198.5s)]
*  So they're gonna keep propping it up, [[03:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12201.38s)]
*  knowing deep down, damn, we're having to spend 30 grand [[03:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12203.38s)]
*  every four weeks to keep all these rappers propped up [[03:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12207.22s)]
*  but these country artists are making millions. [[03:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12209.539999999999s)]
*  But you know what, at least we're still recruiting [[03:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12211.779999999999s)]
*  and persuading these up and coming rappers [[03:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12214.539999999999s)]
*  to come over here. [[03:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12218.22s)]
*  And they wanna keep the rappers [[03:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12219.06s)]
*  so they don't lose market share? [[03:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12220.019999999999s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[03:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12221.38s)]
*  Also you don't wanna let any dependency pop up. [[03:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12222.619999999999s)]
*  This is a fact, I might even get, I don't know, [[03:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12225.22s)]
*  my lawyer will probably call me after this. [[03:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12227.62s)]
*  But when I left Columbia, first of all, [[03:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12229.18s)]
*  I bought myself out of the deal. [[03:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12231.54s)]
*  What does that mean? [[03:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12234.140000000001s)]
*  It means they wanted another album. [[03:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12235.42s)]
*  Yeah. Right? [[03:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12237.060000000001s)]
*  And I said, I'm not doing another album. [[03:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12239.060000000001s)]
*  He said, okay, well, we need money. [[03:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12241.42s)]
*  This is like layman's terms. [[03:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12244.380000000001s)]
*  I'm like, all right, cool, here's a million in some change. [[03:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12246.5s)]
*  Y'all can have it. [[03:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12248.900000000001s)]
*  And also part of that was, well, we want market share [[03:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12250.900000000001s)]
*  on your first 20 songs, whatever the fuck it was, [[03:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12255.38s)]
*  that you put out independent. [[03:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12258.46s)]
*  What do I give a flying fuck [[03:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12259.9s)]
*  about y'all's little dick measuring contest [[03:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12262.38s)]
*  in the industry? [[03:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12264.259999999998s)]
*  Meaning those songs? [[03:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12265.099999999999s)]
*  Meaning like, after I leave the label, [[03:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12266.259999999998s)]
*  when I put out 20 songs independently [[03:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12268.3s)]
*  and hits Daily Double puts out the market share report [[03:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12270.779999999999s)]
*  where UMG has 30%, Sony has 20. [[03:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12274.22s)]
*  Sony wanted to be able to claim my first 20 [[03:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12278.179999999998s)]
*  or whatever songs independently [[03:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12281.22s)]
*  as part of their market share. [[03:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12282.779999999999s)]
*  Even if they're not with Sony. [[03:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12284.74s)]
*  What do I give a fuck about y'all's weird dick measuring [[03:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12286.86s)]
*  contest that you can flex to the other fucking weird CEO [[03:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12289.380000000001s)]
*  at the Christmas party? [[03:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12292.82s)]
*  I don't give a flying fuck, I'm getting out of here. [[03:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12294.14s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[03:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12296.380000000001s)]
*  But it's like, that's what they're moving off of, [[03:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12297.220000000001s)]
*  is market share. [[03:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12300.78s)]
*  Because bonuses are attached with that. [[03:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12302.62s)]
*  If you're number one in market share, [[03:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12304.220000000001s)]
*  get a bigger check fund. [[03:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12305.86s)]
*  Yeah, you as the CEO or whatever. [[03:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12306.7s)]
*  Of course. [[03:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12307.86s)]
*  So my theory with music genres is that [[03:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12308.7s)]
*  any new music genre, it's gonna have its spike [[03:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12311.460000000001s)]
*  and then it's gonna level out. [[03:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12314.62s)]
*  People say rock is dead. [[03:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12316.42s)]
*  Rock's not dead, it's just smaller. [[03:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12317.62s)]
*  They still rock stations, people still, [[03:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12319.98s)]
*  no, I don't think it booms again. [[03:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12322.18s)]
*  I think it just levels out. [[03:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12324.22s)]
*  So it's like, right now we're in the country boom. [[03:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12325.78s)]
*  And it's going to level out. [[03:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12329.02s)]
*  I just think country's in use. [[03:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12330.62s)]
*  Hip hop has leveled out. [[03:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12331.460000000001s)]
*  Can I say a hot take? [[03:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12332.66s)]
*  Now we have Afrobeats, which is a new version of music [[03:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12333.82s)]
*  that people haven't heard and it's booming. [[03:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12337.34s)]
*  I wanna say so many hot takes. [[03:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12339.460000000001s)]
*  Country's not new, country's been around for a long time. [[03:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12341.9s)]
*  No, but I know what you're saying. [[03:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12343.98s)]
*  New to streamers and no, just new to the marketplace [[03:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12345.82s)]
*  where music's being consumed. [[03:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12350.82s)]
*  This is the first time since streaming boom [[03:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12352.26s)]
*  where country music's cool to young people. [[03:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12354.1s)]
*  Yes. [[03:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12355.38s)]
*  But to that point, I think, once again, [[03:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12357.66s)]
*  this is really me holding up a mirror [[03:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12365.82s)]
*  because I'm white. [[03:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12367.46s)]
*  So I feel like I can speak on this. [[03:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12368.699999999999s)]
*  White people are the best. [[03:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12371.9s)]
*  White people and white boys and white chicks [[03:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12372.74s)]
*  with the colleges and sororities and fraternities, [[03:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12375.82s)]
*  so enamored by black culture, right? [[03:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12380.099999999999s)]
*  And for a while, and for a while, [[03:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12383.9s)]
*  it went from, I remember being in high school [[03:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12386.619999999999s)]
*  and there was pockets of the goth chicks and people [[03:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12388.9s)]
*  who they listened to a certain kind of music. [[03:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12392.82s)]
*  There was people listening to, [[03:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12396.220000000001s)]
*  I went to high school, 06, I was a freshman, 2010, [[03:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12398.26s)]
*  I graduated, 20 minutes outside of Atlanta, [[03:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12401.14s)]
*  so snap music and D4L and Soulja Boy came [[03:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12403.02s)]
*  and performed at the pep rally. [[03:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12405.9s)]
*  So it was that era. [[03:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12407.62s)]
*  There was the people who were listening to that [[03:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12409.06s)]
*  and whatever. [[03:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12411.1s)]
*  I think now what's happened with rap [[03:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12412.26s)]
*  is that the people who would have been listening [[03:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12414.02s)]
*  to goth music and goth artists and punk artists, [[03:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12416.34s)]
*  whether it was chemical romance or whatever it was, [[03:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12419.58s)]
*  here's Lil Peep, here's Juice WRLD, [[03:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12423.460000000001s)]
*  hip hop gave every genre a representative. [[03:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12426.46s)]
*  But now what's happening, the pendulum has swung [[03:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12429.5s)]
*  where it's like, you know what? [[03:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12432.58s)]
*  I think I would just rather listen to just the goth artist [[03:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12435.02s)]
*  or just the country artist, not the country hip hop mix, [[03:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12439.26s)]
*  not the goth hip hop mix. [[03:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12442.98s)]
*  There's enough, it's time, right? [[03:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12445.58s)]
*  It's time where it's like it was also hip hop dominated. [[03:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12449.14s)]
*  We gotta really think, right? [[03:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12451.9s)]
*  It's been, 2024, it's been 10, 11, 12 years [[03:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12453.460000000001s)]
*  since trap boomed and it was a complete insurgence [[03:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12457.14s)]
*  and takeover where rap and mainly the production of rap [[03:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12460.22s)]
*  and the trap influence was in everything. [[03:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12465.14s)]
*  Ariana Grande was putting out albums that had trap hi-hats. [[03:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12467.02s)]
*  You feel me? [[03:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12470.78s)]
*  It's like you got the biggest pop stars in the world [[03:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12471.62s)]
*  using hip hop influence in 808s and shit like that. [[03:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12472.98s)]
*  So I just think now enough time has passed [[03:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12476.12s)]
*  where people are like, oh. [[03:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12478.5s)]
*  Starts with the artists where it's like, you know what? [[03:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12480.5s)]
*  I think I just wanna make some punk pop goth shit. [[03:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12482.46s)]
*  Some fucking boys like girls, chemical romance, [[03:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12487.339999999998s)]
*  all American reject shit, I just wanna do that. [[03:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12490.179999999998s)]
*  And then the same people who were listening to [[03:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12493.339999999998s)]
*  maybe the emo version of hip hop are like, [[03:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12496.939999999999s)]
*  oh, you know what? [[03:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12499.9s)]
*  It was really this that I was looking for. [[03:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12501.099999999999s)]
*  This just wasn't there in 2014 but now it is there. [[03:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12503.74s)]
*  And I think, I just think that that's what's happening. [[03:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12507.46s)]
*  It's just, it's becoming a lot. [[03:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12509.779999999999s)]
*  It's becoming more nuanced in there. [[03:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12511.82s)]
*  Yeah, it's becoming a lot more compartmentalized. [[03:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12512.82s)]
*  It's like if you want pop punk emo shit, [[03:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12516.66s)]
*  there's actually pop punk emo bands [[03:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12521.539999999999s)]
*  that can just fulfill that role. [[03:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12524.3s)]
*  And if you want trap rap, there's that. [[03:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12526.38s)]
*  I think the past 10 years, rap just bled over to everything. [[03:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12529.66s)]
*  And so it was massive and now I think you have people [[03:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12533.98s)]
*  like the Noah Cons who are singer songwriters [[03:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12536.7s)]
*  in the Lizzy McAlpines or whatever her name is. [[03:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12540.54s)]
*  She's fucking incredible. [[03:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12543.220000000001s)]
*  And just Luke Bryan's and Morgan Wallen's and Bailey's. [[03:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12544.26s)]
*  Just all these people who occupy real estate [[03:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12547.5s)]
*  that maybe five years ago belonged to rap fans. [[03:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12551.7s)]
*  There was an overlap but now it's just very clear [[03:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12556.58s)]
*  to those same fans that actually this is just what I wanted. [[03:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12558.980000000001s)]
*  Morgan Wallen blew up, right? [[03:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12561.820000000002s)]
*  And I think within a year or two, not Morgan Wallen, [[03:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12563.58s)]
*  Noah Con, that song Stick Season, it's fucking incredible. [[03:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12565.86s)]
*  Sold out Fenway Park. [[03:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12569.220000000001s)]
*  Wow, really? [[03:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12570.9s)]
*  Yes, I think two nights in a row. [[03:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12572.06s)]
*  Jesus, wow. [[03:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12574.26s)]
*  And it's like Fenway Park but you say the name Noah Con [[03:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12576.14s)]
*  in a hip hop space. [[03:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12579.34s)]
*  Nobody knows. [[03:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12580.300000000001s)]
*  I don't know who Noah Con is. [[03:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12581.66s)]
*  Okay, but Stick Season is fucking incredible. [[03:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12583.5s)]
*  They're also probably not buying as many fake streams. [[03:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12587.42s)]
*  No, but you know what, to me, to me bro, [[03:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12589.18s)]
*  I'm just so passionate about great music. [[03:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12593.98s)]
*  And I think that is what will always win. [[03:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12599.42s)]
*  It's great music and I think a lot of artists [[03:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12604.42s)]
*  and a lot of people that get caught up [[03:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12606.300000000001s)]
*  in why things aren't working, why is hip hop failing, [[03:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12607.66s)]
*  why is this, you know what, [[03:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12609.66s)]
*  the greats are always gonna be fine. [[03:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12611.66s)]
*  The greats are always gonna be fine. [[03:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12613.220000000001s)]
*  The people who were never that ill will always fall off. [[03:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12616.380000000001s)]
*  Sorry, this is not related to what you said [[03:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12619.78s)]
*  but I just didn't wanna forget it. [[03:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12621.7s)]
*  Can you talk about industry plants a little bit? [[03:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12622.980000000001s)]
*  I hear that term a lot. [[03:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12624.980000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12626.220000000001s)]
*  What does that even mean? [[03:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12627.060000000001s)]
*  You know what that means to people and it's so funny [[03:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12627.94s)]
*  because the prerequisite years ago used to be [[03:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12629.94s)]
*  you had to be an industry plant. [[03:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12632.9s)]
*  And what industry plant means is basically like [[03:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12634.859999999999s)]
*  we only know you because the industry planted you here. [[03:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12637.5s)]
*  Well, that used to be the only way you could be known. [[03:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12640.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12643.34s)]
*  Think about it, right? [[03:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12644.18s)]
*  It's like the first time I heard J. Cole was 09 [[03:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12645.02s)]
*  on Blueprint 3 on A Star Is Born. [[03:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12648.66s)]
*  I remember I bought Blueprint 3 [[03:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12651.5s)]
*  and Cudi's debut on the same day, September 9th, I think, [[03:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12653.42s)]
*  09, September 13th, something like that. [[03:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12658.1s)]
*  That was the first time I heard J. Cole. [[03:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12660.1s)]
*  Then I heard The Warm Up and it was a rep and I was a fan. [[03:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12661.300000000001s)]
*  He was an industry plant by industry plant standards [[03:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12664.900000000001s)]
*  because first time I hear he was on a Jay-Z album. [[03:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12667.460000000001s)]
*  That's a crazy introduction. [[03:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12670.02s)]
*  You think he was already signed to Jay? [[03:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12670.86s)]
*  But it's like that used to be the- [[03:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12672.94s)]
*  I grew up in Queens and he went to St. John's, I believe. [[03:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12674.220000000001s)]
*  And he was like, I saw him handing out. [[03:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12677.26s)]
*  Right, so you were like early in that way [[03:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12680.62s)]
*  but it's like you used to only be able [[03:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12682.78s)]
*  to find out about artists if the industry pushed them. [[03:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12686.34s)]
*  And then the internet opened up [[03:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12690.02s)]
*  and a lot of this organic rise [[03:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12691.74s)]
*  and guerrilla movements happened [[03:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12694.380000000001s)]
*  to the point where it was very clear [[03:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12697.1s)]
*  if you blew up via internet and guerrilla style [[03:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12698.7s)]
*  or if the industry put you there. [[03:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12702.06s)]
*  And so it started this conversation of, [[03:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12704.94s)]
*  nah, you're not as real as them. [[03:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12706.460000000001s)]
*  And for me, it used to fuck with me a lot, to be honest. [[03:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12710.18s)]
*  People call me industry plant because- [[03:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12715.26s)]
*  Discredits all the work you did. [[03:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12717.5s)]
*  Bro, because I am the furthest thing from it [[03:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12719.1s)]
*  and I get mad because I'm like, [[03:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12724.78s)]

*  Y'all are missing out on so much inspiration. [[03:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12732.74s)]
*  Do you understand that if you actually realize the truth [[03:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12736.300000000001s)]
*  that you would realize you can do it too? [[03:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12741.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12743.86s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[03:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12745.3s)]
*  It's like, bro. [[03:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12746.14s)]
*  They want the justification for why they didn't do it. [[03:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12746.96s)]
*  They don't wanna know how to do it. [[03:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12749.02s)]
*  Of course. [[03:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12749.86s)]
*  They'd rather not do the work and have an excuse. [[03:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12750.699999999999s)]
*  And it, yeah, bro. [[03:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12752.46s)]
*  It's part of the Nepo baby thing. [[03:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12753.3s)]
*  He's on because he cheated, not because you're nice. [[03:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12754.38s)]
*  Right. [[03:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12757.94s)]
*  And you're a workaholic. [[03:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12758.78s)]
*  And you figured out the system and you did that. [[03:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12759.619999999999s)]
*  Well, you guys had money, [[03:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12761.1s)]
*  so it actually doesn't count, would you? [[03:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12762.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12763.42s)]
*  And it, bro, used to bother the fuck out of me [[03:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12764.38s)]
*  because I prided myself on that. [[03:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12767.06s)]
*  It was a part of my identity. [[03:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12768.3s)]

*  Damn, y'all about it. [[03:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12771.74s)]
*  Especially, it came during a time [[03:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12772.78s)]
*  where they were taking away everything else, it felt like. [[03:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12774.26s)]
*  I was like, damn, y'all taking away that, too? [[03:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12776.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12778.300000000001s)]

*  Yeah. [[03:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12780.58s)]
*  Like, wait, y'all are saying this now? [[03:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12781.42s)]
*  What were they saying? [[03:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12783.1s)]
*  And I remember the dude who started the rumor, straight up. [[03:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12784.22s)]
*  And I'm cool with him now. [[03:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12786.460000000001s)]
*  What rumor? [[03:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12787.300000000001s)]
*  What were they saying? [[03:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12788.14s)]
*  So the rumor was it started on Kanye Tilde. [[03:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12788.960000000001s)]
*  It was a forum. [[03:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12790.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12791.82s)]
*  Right? [[03:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12792.66s)]
*  And the rumor was my dad worked for Columbia. [[03:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12793.5s)]
*  Oh. [[03:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12795.460000000001s)]
*  And that's how I got on. [[03:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12796.300000000001s)]
*  First of all, none of that makes sense. [[03:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12797.82s)]
*  Right? [[03:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12799.5s)]
*  It's like, so then why did I have to put out 11 mixed-ups? [[03:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12800.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[03:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12803.18s)]
*  Oh, so he conveniently got hired after the 11th mixtape? [[03:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12804.42s)]
*  It's like, okay, that's awesome. [[03:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12807.460000000001s)]
*  So I'm putting out 11 mixtapes and I'll make you famous. [[03:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12809.58s)]
*  Right, so yeah, right. [[03:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12811.66s)]
*  And I remember just being so pissed, bro. [[03:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12813.82s)]
*  So pissed. [[03:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12816.58s)]
*  And there's still people who like, [[03:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12817.66s)]
*  you know I get the comments of like, [[03:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12820.94s)]
*  this fake independent shit, [[03:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12823.26s)]
*  talk about how your dad gave you all the, [[03:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12824.74s)]
*  I'm like, what? [[03:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12826.34s)]
*  Where do you think this comes from in people? [[03:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12827.94s)]
*  Not just you, this is a human. [[03:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12830.54s)]
*  I think, you know what it comes from? [[03:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12832.22s)]
*  It comes from an inability to look at yourself. [[03:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12833.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12837.42s)]
*  It's an inability to have accountability [[03:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12838.26s)]
*  for the choices you've made and where they've landed you. [[03:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12841.859999999999s)]
*  And it's easier to say, [[03:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12845.779999999999s)]
*  I haven't gotten to where I wanna get to [[03:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12847.859999999999s)]
*  because I'm not cheating like he is. [[03:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12850.779999999999s)]
*  I would say it's a fear of looking at yourself. [[03:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12852.82s)]
*  Absolutely. [[03:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12854.74s)]
*  You know, I mean, inability almost gives them [[03:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12855.58s)]
*  too much credit. The fear provides that inability. [[03:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12857.859999999999s)]
*  Yeah. They're not dumb. [[03:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12859.9s)]
*  They're terrified. [[03:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12860.74s)]
*  They're scared to look at yourself. [[03:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12861.56s)]
*  They're scared to realize those things. [[03:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12862.4s)]
*  It's awful, bro. [[03:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12864.24s)]
*  It's awful, especially if you view yourself [[03:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12865.08s)]
*  and your identity is tied to you being awesome. [[03:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12866.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12869.72s)]
*  And you being the man. [[03:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12870.56s)]
*  That for me was like my downfall. [[03:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12871.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12873.48s)]
*  Was like, I got my perceived confidence [[03:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12874.32s)]
*  from thinking I was the man. [[03:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12880.92s)]
*  And so when things would happen [[03:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12884.119999999999s)]
*  that would tell me I wasn't the man, [[03:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12885.6s)]
*  and I talk about it on the song Fraud on Santiago, [[03:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12888.16s)]
*  it wasn't surface level where it's like, [[03:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12891.6s)]
*  okay, big deal, like people say you're not the man. [[03:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12893.16s)]
*  It's like, nah, beneath the surface is, [[03:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12895.76s)]
*  it made me question, well then who am I then? [[03:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12897.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12900.039999999999s)]
*  That's the imposter syndrome shit. [[03:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12900.88s)]
*  Right, because if who I am is the man [[03:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12902.119999999999s)]
*  and something happens that's like, you're clearly not, [[03:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12904.96s)]
*  then it's like, well, who am I then? [[03:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12907.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12909.52s)]
*  And it's a fuck with my head. [[03:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12910.359999999999s)]
*  Because deep down you're like, I'm not the man. [[03:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12911.18s)]
*  I'm not the man. [[03:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12913.0s)]
*  Can I see this? [[03:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12913.84s)]
*  And if I'm not the man, [[03:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12914.68s)]
*  what am I? [[03:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12916.76s)]
*  I'm nothing. [[03:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12917.6s)]
*  Do you ever think about how beneficial the insecurity was? [[03:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12918.42s)]
*  Cause and I'm curious, do you ever think like, [[03:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12921.52s)]
*  yo, if I was fully secure, [[03:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12923.04s)]
*  what would I be doing right now? [[03:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12924.72s)]
*  Cause I don't think you'd be this. [[03:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12926.16s)]
*  I think if I was, you know what? [[03:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12928.48s)]
*  Let me actually answer it like this. [[03:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12930.84s)]
*  I think there was a big, big part of me, [[03:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12933.880000000001s)]
*  still is where I compare my struggles. [[03:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12936.16s)]
*  Meaning like, damn, [[03:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12940.24s)]
*  my struggles aren't valid [[03:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12943.220000000001s)]
*  because my struggles aren't that struggle. [[03:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12947.62s)]
*  And I had to realize that, you know what? [[03:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12950.820000000002s)]
*  Yeah, maybe I didn't grow up a certain way, [[03:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12953.980000000001s)]
*  but I had my own struggles that are specific to me. [[03:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12956.94s)]
*  That are difficult. [[03:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12960.86s)]
*  Yeah, maybe my struggle wasn't, [[03:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12961.7s)]
*  my mom was an alcoholic and my dad left [[03:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12963.78s)]
*  or whatever the fuck it is, right? [[03:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12966.060000000001s)]
*  It's like, but maybe my struggle was [[03:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12967.460000000001s)]
*  what it was on Santiago. [[03:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12970.18s)]
*  It's like to compare struggles [[03:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12971.939999999999s)]
*  also fuels that imposter syndrome where it's like, [[03:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12974.699999999999s)]
*  oh, so if my struggle isn't as tough, [[03:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12978.259999999998s)]
*  perception wise, as their struggle, [[03:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12982.46s)]
*  his struggle, her struggle, [[03:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12985.46s)]
*  that means that my shit isn't real. [[03:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12987.259999999998s)]
*  And that made me start dismissing my own struggle [[03:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12990.179999999998s)]
*  where it was like, bro, get over it. [[03:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12993.539999999999s)]
*  Cause your shit is not even as real as that. [[03:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12996.019999999999s)]
*  And it's like, that comes from comparing struggles [[03:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=12998.9s)]
*  and thinking that my shit needs to be that. [[03:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13001.699999999999s)]
*  And it's like, you know. [[03:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13005.02s)]
*  I think the fear might be if you put it out there [[03:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13005.86s)]
*  and then people tell you that's not even a real struggle, [[03:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13007.619999999999s)]
*  then you got vulnerable and then you get told [[03:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13009.82s)]
*  the shit that hurt your feelings [[03:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13011.86s)]
*  wasn't even worth getting your feelings hurt [[03:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13013.3s)]
*  and you're like, well, fuck more. [[03:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13014.94s)]
*  Oh yeah, getting gas lit by society [[03:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13015.78s)]
*  is just par for the course. [[03:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13017.539999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[03:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13019.38s)]
*  That's what that, I mean, cause that's what that is, right? [[03:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13020.22s)]
*  When I canceled the European tour [[03:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13022.66s)]
*  and I didn't even fully know why I needed to cancel, [[03:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13024.82s)]
*  I just knew I needed to, [[03:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13027.62s)]
*  I was getting gas lit by the thousands. [[03:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13029.3s)]
*  And then, oh, like, for lack of better words, get over it. [[03:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13031.62s)]
*  Big deal, I'm going through shit too. [[03:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13038.5s)]
*  My girl just left me. [[03:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13040.1s)]
*  I just lost my job. [[03:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13041.42s)]
*  It's like, all right, so fuck what I'm going through then. [[03:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13043.66s)]
*  Because that's how men operate. [[03:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13046.78s)]
*  That's how men operate. [[03:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13048.34s)]
*  It's also men, but it's also successful people. [[03:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13049.86s)]
*  It's like, nobody wants to hear Jeff Bezos' problems. [[03:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13052.26s)]
*  If you got a problem with your girl, [[03:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13054.58s)]
*  keep that shit to yourself. [[03:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13055.66s)]
*  Straight up. [[03:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13056.74s)]
*  And I think there's less, yeah. [[03:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13057.58s)]
*  And I get that. [[03:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13058.98s)]
*  There is a lack of empathy, but I, you know, [[03:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13060.02s)]
*  I talked about. That's the cost of success. [[03:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13062.5s)]
*  I talked about, and it is forever, [[03:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13063.78s)]
*  to use your word, odd to me. [[03:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13066.98s)]
*  Because it is awfully odd that as successful people, [[03:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13069.22s)]
*  we are not allowed to experience the average human emotion [[03:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13079.06s)]
*  without scrutiny. [[03:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13084.78s)]
*  However, the average human expects us to act [[03:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13086.26s)]
*  like we're not above them. [[03:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13090.939999999999s)]
*  But you treat us like we are above feeling what you feel. [[03:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13092.46s)]
*  And that's what's confusing to me. [[03:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13098.14s)]
*  It's like, if the average person is like, [[03:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13100.58s)]
*  you're so rich and successful, [[03:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13102.66s)]
*  you're not allowed to be sad. [[03:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13104.66s)]
*  It's like, okay, let's go with that. [[03:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13106.66s)]
*  So you're telling me that, in a way, [[03:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13109.82s)]
*  you're telling me, I'm above you. [[03:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13112.099999999999s)]
*  I'm so much above you that I can't even feel [[03:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13114.98s)]
*  your peasant emotions. [[03:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13117.619999999999s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[03:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13119.74s)]
*  I don't think they say you're not allowed to be sad. [[03:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13120.58s)]
*  That's what it is. [[03:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13122.34s)]
*  I think they say, we just don't care if you're sad. [[03:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13123.18s)]
*  No, but even. [[03:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13125.14s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[03:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13126.58s)]
*  It's literally like. [[03:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13127.42s)]
*  You can't be sad about rich shit. [[03:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13128.26s)]
*  Don't. [[03:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13130.1s)]
*  No, it's not, no, no, no. [[03:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13130.939999999999s)]
*  It's not even rich. [[03:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13131.76s)]
*  You could be sad about breaking up with your girl. [[03:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13132.6s)]
*  No, you can't. [[03:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13133.699999999999s)]
*  I think that they would have empathy [[03:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13134.539999999999s)]
*  because they point through that. [[03:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13135.779999999999s)]
*  It's just, if you're rich, all of your problems are like. [[03:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13136.619999999999s)]
*  You literally just said Jeff Bezos. [[03:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13142.42s)]
*  Then I really. [[03:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13143.98s)]
*  We're not trying to. [[03:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13144.82s)]
*  And so to me. [[03:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13145.64s)]
*  If you got cheated on by his girl, [[03:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13146.48s)]
*  you could talk about how difficult that was. [[03:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13147.859999999999s)]
*  I just think it's interesting how society [[03:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13148.699999999999s)]
*  holds celebrities to an emotional standard [[03:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13150.42s)]
*  that's above their own and then act bizarre [[03:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13154.939999999999s)]
*  and act offended if a celebrity acts like they're above them. [[03:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13158.06s)]
*  But you have literally told them who you think they are. [[03:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13160.939999999999s)]
*  You think they're above you [[03:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13163.779999999999s)]
*  because you think they are [[03:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13165.779999999999s)]
*  immune to feeling what you feel. [[03:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13171.279999999999s)]
*  Because they've achieved something higher [[03:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13174.06s)]
*  than you could ever achieve. [[03:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13175.939999999999s)]
*  No, maybe they feel. [[03:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13176.779999999999s)]
*  I think that's something important to understand. [[03:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13178.22s)]
*  It's like achieving wealth specifically [[03:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13180.02s)]
*  is so monumentally difficult. [[03:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13183.46s)]
*  Like there are people that are, [[03:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13185.98s)]
*  they can't even fathom making what you might make in a month. [[03:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13188.439999999999s)]
*  So the idea of having that, it feels if you don't have it [[03:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13192.539999999999s)]
*  that it would solve all the problems [[03:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13197.279999999999s)]
*  because it's so just far-fetched. [[03:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13199.539999999999s)]
*  So they can't even conceptualize or empathize [[03:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13202.18s)]
*  with going through these other things [[03:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13204.5s)]
*  because in their mind, just like all of us [[03:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13206.62s)]
*  before we had any money, we were like, [[03:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13208.460000000001s)]
*  man, if I had all the money, [[03:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13210.02s)]
*  there wouldn't be a fucking care in the world. [[03:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13211.34s)]
*  My girl breaks up with me, I'm getting another girl. [[03:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13213.18s)]
*  I'm getting four girls. [[03:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13215.02s)]
*  I'm going on vacation to this. [[03:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13215.86s)]
*  So there just probably is a lack of empathy for it. [[03:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13217.18s)]
*  And this is why I always tell my fans and people is like, [[03:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13221.220000000001s)]
*  listen, I think the best level of understanding [[03:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13223.98s)]
*  somebody could give you sometimes [[03:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13227.66s)]
*  is understanding that you don't understand. [[03:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13230.02s)]
*  Just give me that. [[03:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13233.140000000001s)]
*  Because in that, there is understanding. [[03:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13235.78s)]
*  You could tell me something you're going through [[03:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13238.74s)]
*  and I may not relate to it, [[03:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13240.98s)]
*  but I can at least deploy the empathy and understanding [[03:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13242.7s)]
*  to know that I don't understand. [[03:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13244.94s)]
*  And so therefore I'm not gonna pass judgment [[03:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13247.78s)]
*  and say you should or shouldn't be feeling this. [[03:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13250.54s)]
*  I'm just gonna understand that I don't understand. [[03:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13252.640000000001s)]
*  That ain't what the internet's for. [[03:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13255.9s)]
*  No, commenting, hey listen, [[03:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13257.34s)]
*  I don't understand is not gonna happen. [[03:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13259.34s)]
*  The people that don't understand don't comment. [[03:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13262.26s)]
*  Exactly. [[03:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13263.74s)]
*  The people that don't understand comment [[03:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13264.58s)]
*  and say this is dumb. [[03:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13265.94s)]
*  I'm sorry, yeah, the people that understand [[03:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13266.86s)]
*  don't understand. [[03:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13268.26s)]
*  Exactly, the people with empathy [[03:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13269.1s)]
*  are just gonna not say anything. [[03:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13270.380000000001s)]
*  Well and that's like, I saw this on, [[03:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13271.5s)]
*  or I said this on Twitter earlier, [[03:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13273.82s)]
*  it's like social media birthed the rise of the haters [[03:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13275.58s)]
*  because being cool in a lot of people's eyes [[03:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13279.98s)]
*  is getting views and retweets [[03:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13283.74s)]
*  and negativity gets the most views and retweets [[03:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13284.94s)]
*  so you got a bunch of people who want to be cool [[03:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13286.9s)]
*  and the quickest way to get there is by being a hater [[03:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13291.14s)]
*  and passing judgment. [[03:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13294.46s)]
*  So it's cool to, we all laugh, me included, [[03:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13295.699999999999s)]
*  see a quote tweet, if it's got enough retweets [[03:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13299.779999999999s)]
*  it must be funny and it's hilarious and you laugh [[03:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13302.779999999999s)]
*  and it's like damn, it's kinda crazy that [[03:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13305.06s)]
*  random people with no profile picture [[03:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13307.74s)]
*  just get popping and get paid now for being a hater. [[03:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13309.539999999999s)]
*  I'm not from that generation where it's like, [[03:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13315.220000000001s)]
*  you got literally applauded for being a hater [[03:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13317.740000000002s)]
*  because we would've just asked, [[03:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13322.42s)]
*  but what do you do with your life? [[03:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13323.78s)]
*  And it's like if your claim to your bank account is, [[03:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13326.86s)]
*  oh I passed judgment and I hate on Twitter, [[03:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13330.54s)]
*  that's how I get money, you're a loser. [[03:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13333.060000000001s)]
*  I don't care how you got your money, you're a loser. [[03:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13335.980000000001s)]
*  You're still a loser. [[03:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13340.94s)]
*  Is that the cost of success? [[03:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13342.62s)]
*  Yeah, that comes with the dinner. [[03:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13345.18s)]
*  It's like, yeah, par for the course. [[03:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13346.26s)]
*  Like I wonder if some of this is, [[03:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13348.5s)]
*  like as maybe annoying as it is, [[03:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13351.060000000001s)]
*  as we can call it behavior, loser behavior, whatever, [[03:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13354.18s)]
*  part of the cost of being able to take your mom [[03:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13357.74s)]
*  around the whole world, go to America, do it, [[03:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13360.58s)]
*  there's gonna be a negative to it. [[03:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13363.42s)]
*  Has to be trade off. [[03:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13364.66s)]
*  Has to be trade off. [[03:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13366.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah and it's like, if that's the trade off, so be it. [[03:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13367.140000000001s)]
*  You know why? [[03:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13371.1s)]
*  Because it's like the positive is so much crazier. [[03:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13371.92s)]
*  The positive is crazy. [[03:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13373.82s)]
*  The negative, it's like, all right, so the negative is like [[03:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13374.66s)]
*  maybe once in a blue moon, like something goes viral [[03:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13377.38s)]
*  about you negatively. [[03:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13379.859999999999s)]
*  The positive is every day my mom is good and in a beach house. [[03:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13381.22s)]
*  It's like, so like maybe three times a year I get shit on, [[03:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13387.46s)]
*  but 365 days out the year I'm leaving my dream. [[03:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13391.1s)]
*  So like I win, ever. [[03:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13394.699999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[03:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13396.779999999999s)]
*  And that's the thing to focus on 100% perspective. [[03:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13398.14s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[03:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13400.74s)]
*  I think it's easy to get too cool [[03:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13402.14s)]
*  because we're so zoomed in. [[03:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13403.78s)]
*  It's also like when you create art or you really care [[03:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13405.02s)]
*  about the thing that you're creating, [[03:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13408.699999999999s)]
*  anything that is. [[03:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13410.94s)]
*  It's hard to not personalize. [[03:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13412.14s)]
*  Display negatively about it, like it hurts you a little bit. [[03:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13413.14s)]
*  Of course. [[03:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13415.82s)]
*  Absolutely, that makes sense. [[03:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13416.66s)]
*  Because we're so close. [[03:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13417.84s)]
*  If we were creating a fucking power bar [[03:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13418.68s)]
*  or we're creating some random product, [[03:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13420.72s)]
*  it's not like our love and our passion is in it. [[03:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13423.24s)]
*  We're like, how much protein can we get into this bar? [[03:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13426.02s)]
*  Oh, did we get 40 grams? [[03:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13428.02s)]
*  Okay, we got it in. [[03:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13428.98s)]
*  I also think that's our genius though, [[03:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13429.82s)]
*  is having, and Rick Rubin talks about this, [[03:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13431.779999999999s)]
*  the antennas being up. [[03:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13434.74s)]
*  Yeah, the sensitivity is what allows us. [[03:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13436.5s)]
*  The sensitivity is like. [[03:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13437.86s)]
*  That's taste, to be honest with you. [[03:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13438.699999999999s)]
*  It's like you look at somebody like Kanye [[03:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13440.18s)]
*  or you look at somebody like Drake. [[03:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13442.539999999999s)]
*  You're on board now. [[03:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13444.22s)]
*  And it's like, no, but listen. [[03:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13445.22s)]
*  But it's like you look at somebody like Kanye or Drake [[03:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13446.86s)]
*  and it's like damn, why are they so big? [[03:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13450.02s)]
*  Yeah, the music's great and whatever. [[03:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13452.32s)]
*  But a lot of what's impacting and staying with people [[03:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13454.3s)]
*  is the vulnerability. [[03:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13457.14s)]
*  And their ability to be sensitive to what they're feeling [[03:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13459.380000000001s)]
*  and express it in an authentic way. [[03:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13462.380000000001s)]
*  That can't happen if you don't give a fuck. [[03:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13464.62s)]
*  The reality though is that that attribute [[03:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13468.86s)]
*  doesn't live inside of a vacuum. [[03:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13472.54s)]
*  It's gonna also bleed over into other aspects of their life. [[03:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13473.98s)]
*  And so you're gonna get outbursts [[03:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13477.78s)]
*  because they're sensitive. [[03:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13480.1s)]
*  Because they're feeling what they're feeling. [[03:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13482.060000000001s)]
*  You can't be good at this if you're not sensitive. [[03:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13482.9s)]
*  You can't be a great artist if you're not sensitive. [[03:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13484.42s)]
*  No, it's like I used to be, [[03:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13485.94s)]
*  I used to feel, it didn't last long, [[03:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13488.48s)]
*  but it was for a little bit where I was like, [[03:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13490.72s)]
*  man, I'm too sensitive. [[03:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13491.84s)]
*  I gotta let this shit go. [[03:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13493.84s)]
*  And I was like, nah, bro. [[03:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13494.68s)]
*  That is literally my superpower. [[03:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13497.16s)]
*  That's the magic, yeah. [[03:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13498.76s)]
*  My ability to have the antenna up [[03:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13500.76s)]
*  and to receive the message and execute it [[03:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13505.32s)]
*  without interference is the superpower. [[03:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13510.8s)]
*  And if I start letting the outside world tell me [[03:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13513.48s)]
*  that having my antennas up is weak, [[03:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13515.8s)]
*  then I'll be y'all. [[03:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13518.4s)]
*  And I don't wanna be y'all. [[03:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13519.24s)]
*  Y'all suck. [[03:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13520.84s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[03:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13523.08s)]
*  You wanna feel? [[03:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13524.039999999999s)]
*  I don't wanna live y'all's life. [[03:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13524.88s)]
*  God forbid. [[03:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13527.16s)]
*  Okay. [[03:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13528.0s)]
*  Okay. [[03:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13528.84s)]
*  Russ, listen, we've been, [[03:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13534.679999999998s)]
*  I don't know how long we've been going on this. [[03:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13536.48s)]
*  Is that the time right there? [[03:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13538.8s)]
*  Five and a half? [[03:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13540.84s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[03:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13542.08s)]
*  Five, 30. [[03:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13544.519999999999s)]
*  What time do we start? [[03:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13545.92s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[03:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13546.76s)]
*  Start at like 1.30 or something like that? [[03:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13547.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13548.42s)]
*  About four hours rolling in. [[03:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13549.26s)]
*  Oh my God, bro. [[03:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13550.08s)]
*  Okay, so then before we go, anything else, [[03:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13551.880000000001s)]
*  what is the next 20 years, [[03:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13555.960000000001s)]
*  in 20 years when we come back and we reflect on this, [[03:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13558.640000000001s)]
*  when we're chilling on the Amalfi Coast [[03:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13561.24s)]
*  and we're laughing about the last vacation [[03:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13563.0s)]
*  that we went on and all the family is good [[03:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13565.24s)]
*  and there's more family and that family even has family, [[03:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13568.36s)]
*  all those things are happening. [[03:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13571.0s)]
*  What is the conversation about? [[03:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13573.32s)]
*  Where is Russ mentally? [[03:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13576.08s)]
*  What are you creating? [[03:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13578.36s)]
*  Honestly, I think for me, [[03:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13582.08s)]
*  I just want to get closer and closer [[03:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13583.68s)]
*  to an authentic balance [[03:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13588.16s)]
*  between my personal life and my career. [[03:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13589.68s)]
*  And I think my whole 20s, [[03:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13593.26s)]
*  I spent down the rabbit hole of feeding my career. [[03:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13595.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13598.480000000001s)]
*  Which is natural and it's good and it's paid off. [[03:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13599.460000000001s)]
*  And now I'm trying to incorporate some of this balance [[03:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13602.519999999999s)]
*  and I think in 20 years, [[03:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13604.08s)]
*  I'm never gonna stop making music. [[03:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13605.599999999999s)]
*  It's like, are you ever gonna stop thinking shit is funny? [[03:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13607.119999999999s)]
*  No. [[03:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13610.039999999999s)]
*  So it's like, I'll always be making music. [[03:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13610.88s)]
*  I just think I wanna get even closer to this place of like, [[03:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13613.4s)]
*  y'all just don't see me, you feel me though. [[03:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13619.08s)]
*  And that's it. [[03:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13622.279999999999s)]
*  Because to the fisherman fable, [[03:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13623.119999999999s)]
*  that's what it's about. [[03:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13626.119999999999s)]
*  That's it. [[03:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13627.199999999999s)]
*  I'm already living like that [[03:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13628.039999999999s)]
*  but I wanna get even closer to like, [[03:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13629.720000000001s)]
*  yo, I'm putting out music from this island [[03:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13633.08s)]
*  and that's that. [[03:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13635.800000000001s)]
*  You take seven years off, then you make an album. [[03:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13637.52s)]
*  Yeah, because bro, to be honest, [[03:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13639.880000000001s)]
*  I'm also trying to show my fans [[03:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13641.880000000001s)]
*  and show people who care enough to pay attention [[03:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13644.08s)]
*  that there's an authentic alternative way [[03:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13647.56s)]
*  to do this whole music thing. [[03:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13650.78s)]
*  And sometimes I beat myself up for not playing the game more, [[03:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13653.32s)]
*  being in LA and being on the scene [[03:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13657.32s)]
*  and like, damn, I should have been at that party [[03:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13660.08s)]
*  and I bet if I had a spot in LA for three months, [[03:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13661.52s)]
*  I would have been here. [[03:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13664.52s)]
*  And it's like, yeah, maybe you would have been. [[03:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13665.480000000001s)]
*  But then what? [[03:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13668.1s)]
*  And maybe it would have paid off here. [[03:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13668.94s)]
*  But it's like, damn bro, ask yourself the why. [[03:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13671.320000000002s)]
*  The why is so important. [[03:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13675.6s)]
*  It's like, all right, so you could have moved there. [[03:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13677.44s)]
*  You could have went to that party. [[03:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13680.320000000002s)]
*  You could have said something different. [[03:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13681.800000000001s)]
*  Why though? [[03:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13683.560000000001s)]
*  Oh, well then people would fuck with me more [[03:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13685.08s)]
*  and they would know that I'm really who I think I am. [[03:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13687.76s)]
*  Oh, so you don't think you are who you think you are. [[03:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13690.039999999999s)]
*  It's like it's a lack of your own approval. [[03:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13693.439999999999s)]
*  And so I'm just trying to get closer to the point of like, [[03:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13697.279999999999s)]
*  bro, like y'all can run around [[03:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13700.679999999998s)]
*  and chase all this weirdo shit. [[03:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13704.16s)]
*  And I just, I want to deploy empathy to everyone. [[03:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13707.279999999999s)]
*  I wish I could talk to every artist who's popping [[03:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13712.679999999998s)]
*  and just be like, and just talk straight up [[03:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13715.88s)]
*  because I feel like all of us are living inside [[03:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13719.08s)]
*  of this fucking tunnel where we can't move either way. [[03:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13724.519999999999s)]
*  And we think we're the only ones in here. [[03:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13729.08s)]
*  And we see everyone else's Instagram [[03:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13731.519999999999s)]
*  and everyone else's success. [[03:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13733.64s)]
*  And we assume that damn, man, they haven't figured out. [[03:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13735.16s)]
*  Not knowing that they're sitting there like this. [[03:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13739.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13740.96s)]
*  You know? [[03:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13741.8s)]
*  And we're just all too prideful [[03:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13742.64s)]
*  to like talk to each other. [[03:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13744.28s)]
*  And I try and I try to hit up people. [[03:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13746.16s)]
*  But I understand like the music business, it's politics. [[03:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13748.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13751.68s)]
*  And I mean that not in the like, I don't know, [[03:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13752.52s)]
*  in the weird way, it's like everyone's a politician. [[03:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13756.52s)]
*  And so you fuck with somebody based off of like temperature [[03:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13758.960000000001s)]
*  right now and what they can do for you right now. [[03:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13763.52s)]
*  Sure. [[03:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13765.560000000001s)]

*  you won't even respond to the DM, [[03:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4l-vlvMhA&t=13767.720000000001s)]
