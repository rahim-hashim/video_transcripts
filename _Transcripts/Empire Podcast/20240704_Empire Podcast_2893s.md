*  Arizona Territory, April 30th, 1871. The canyon, known as Aravipa, lies still in the pre-dawn
*  darkness. The only sounds to be heard in the early morning calm, the song of birds and the
*  lilt of running water as it courses its way towards the nearby San Pedro River. Suddenly,
*  out of the shadows, emerges a crowd of newcomers. As they draw near the intruders, some mounted on
*  horseback, others on foot, whisper to one another in Spanish. As the group advances, the Apache
*  shelters come into view in the half-light. The intruders begin to sprint upstream along the
*  creek bed, passing at each gowder to club to death the adults and to seize or kill whatever
*  children they can locate within. For many Ine, murdered while they slumber, the attack lasts
*  but an instant. But as the early morning stillness is broken by hurried footfalls, the crack of club
*  against bone and the barking of Apache dogs, some Ine awakening flee in terror. A few succeed
*  in scaling the steep bluffs lining the canyon or hiding in the thick brush along the creek bank.
*  Many others, however, fall victim to the men waiting in the rocks above, who fire down at them
*  as the sun rises over the jagged peaks. Its light reveals scores of Ine corpses sprawled along the
*  creek. Seeing the camp abandoned, its once-sleeping inhabitants either dead or dispersed, the attackers
*  set the Apache's possessions and their empty gowders ablaze before withdrawing. A quick count
*  as the raiders reconnoitre a few miles away reveals that not one of them was killed or even
*  injured in the assault. They succeeded, however, in seizing 29 Apache captives and in killing perhaps
*  as many as 144 Ine, all of them sleeping women and children, in an attack lasting little more
*  than 30 minutes. Hello, welcome to Empire with me, Anita Arnon. And me, William Durampol.
*  And what you just heard was the extraordinarily powerful extract from our guest's book,
*  Carl Jacobi is with us, author of Shadows at Dawn and Apache Massacre and the Violence of History.
*  And it is an extract which brings a story to its climax that we're going to examine
*  forensically. How did we get to this? It's called the Camp Grant Massacre. It is an absolutely
*  brutal tale, which in many ways exemplifies what will become the entire destruction of Native
*  American life in America. Carl, thank you very much for being with us again. In the last episode,
*  we were talking about this sort of peace protocol that had managed to lead to violence against the
*  Indigenous people, not just the Apache or Ine, but Native Americans wherever they might live
*  in what is now the United States. And this comes from this desire to either force Indigenous people
*  onto reservations and or force them to assimilate and lose all contact with who they once were.
*  Tell us about Camp Grant, first of all, because that's where that particular awfulness takes
*  place. Give us a pencil sketch of where it is and why it is an important place.
*  Sure. So thank you for having me on. Camp Grant is the military camp, obviously, as it suggests.
*  It's named after then President Ulysses S. Grant. So it's an homage of sorts to this person who's
*  seen as the architect of the so-called peace policy towards American Indians, which as we mentioned,
*  is ironically quite violent. And it's located at the intersection of two important waterways in
*  sort of middle of what would now be the middle of Arizona, just north of Tucson. It's just a San Pedro
*  River, which runs north south. And so this has actually been a sort of a route that's used going
*  into Mexico for generations. And then the Irovaipa Creek. And as I tried to outline in the introduction,
*  it's one of the few sources of running water in the area. And so it's an incredibly sort of valuable
*  place for Native people. They've been struggling to hang on to this place, this site for years.
*  And the US Army has erected this camp right at the intersection there because they realize it's so
*  important to Native people and they're trying to seize control of this particular space.
*  – And Carl, we had an impression of this last episode, but in case anyone listening
*  didn't hear that. In the immediate period preceding this, there's been a process of complete
*  dehumanization of the Apache, the Inne, for many of the local inhabitants. And the policy dictated
*  by Washington is regarded by many of the locals as an absurd, idealistic policy that doesn't take in
*  what in their words would be savage barbarians capable of extreme violence who must be exterminated.
*  – Yes. I mean, it's really grim stuff. I mean, basically a lot of the local settlers in Arizona
*  want or advocating for a complete extermination of the Apache. And although from my perspective,
*  the Army is being quite violent in general towards the Apache. It's not violent enough
*  towards the Apache for a lot of the settlers. I just wanted to say too,
*  of course, I've been to Aravaipa Canyon several times. And I remember the first time I went there
*  and you are going through what is a very desolate landscape. You're in the middle of a sort of the
*  northern edge of what would be the Sonoran Desert. And so this is the landscape that you see in a
*  lot of Western movies with the big saguaro cactuses and the Palo Verdes and stuff. And then you get
*  into Aravaipa and it's just this profusion, just this richness of wildlife and this richness of
*  water and green paradise. And you can see why the Apaches are so closely or sort of so excited
*  about this particular region and why they fought so hard to keep their presence there.
*  – It's gorgeous and it's very easy to live there. There's the profusion of all the life
*  they depend on. – Well, where there's water, there is life. And that's why this camp grant
*  is set up here. Let's talk about the camp commander, a man called, well, you would say Lieutenant
*  Royal Whitman, Lieutenant to us and our old money. But yeah, tell us about a Royal Whitman. Who is he
*  exactly, the camp commander? – Well, so like a lot of the officers at this time, he's a veteran
*  of the Civil War. Almost all the U.S. Army officers who are involved in the so-called Indian War,
*  is the term I don't agree with. We could talk about that more if you want to later. But they're all
*  veterans of the Civil War. He's originally from Maine, so he's a Northerner. He actually worked
*  as a saddle maker before he goes into the Army during the Civil War and then I think decided that
*  he liked being in the military more than making saddles. So he ends up staying in the military
*  afterwards and then he gets posted out to Arizona. And so when all this is happening, actually,
*  at Camp Grant, he's just very recently arrived. He arrives in November of 1870.
*  – And what kind of guy is he? What's his attitude to these indigenous peoples?
*  – So as best we know, he doesn't write. I wish he kept a diary. I mean, if I were to give him
*  instructions as a historian, he needed to keep a diary or something. But he is from the North. He's
*  one of these kind of reformers, so to speak, which is to say that out of the kind of abolitionist
*  group that was fighting the Civil War, I think that's why he volunteered for the Civil War.
*  And so he now sees himself as trying, as we'll see when we get into the specifics, trying to
*  reform Indian society as well. So he's very much of the kind of Grant Peace Policy group.
*  – I mean, I've seen his monument is at Arlington Cemetery. Let me just describe it to you because
*  I think it's one of the only representations we have of his face, but Raw Whitman, it's an engraved
*  thing in stone. And he looks a little bit like a Dickensian man of letters. He's got this sort of
*  avuncular kindly face, a big full mustache and a beard. He looks less like a military man and more
*  like an uncle who'd probably be quite kind to you. And yet he's associated with one of the most
*  bloody chapters in Native American history, but more of that in a moment. So we talked about,
*  so he arrives at 1870. I mean, do we know what he's like? Do we know what he's like to his men,
*  what they think of him? – I think he's just a kind of generic officer, to be quite honest. I mean,
*  he does reveal some interesting sort of traits. What happens is the Apaches come and they want to
*  make a treaty with him and he reveals some very interesting traits then. But I don't think there
*  was anything prior to that moment. – All right. Well, let's not blow that surprise. So he's just
*  a run-of-the-mill. He's a run-of-the-mill returnee from the Civil War. February 1871, a small group
*  of Apache women approach the fort. And they're looking, they're actually there because they're
*  looking for a kid, aren't they? He's gone missing. – Yes. So they're looking for a child of one of
*  them who's gone missing that has been seized by the army and they're trying to get the child back.
*  It's important to note that often Apache women were the negotiators initially during a lot of
*  these peace arrangements. And that's done in part because women are seen as not a threat. And so you
*  would send them in. And then also elder women, which is often what I think these women were.
*  First, they're not childbearing years, but also elder women in Apache society are valued elders.
*  And they're sort of seen as having the authority to make this kind of negotiation. My sense is
*  they're trying to get the child back immediately, but they're also, Whitman and his men have just
*  moved in to Camp Grant. They're sort of moving in to replace the previous union. And I think they're
*  trying to take the measure of them and try to figure out what kind of person is this. – So they
*  don't have the child. I mean, it turns out this child is not in the camp, as the women suspect
*  he might be. So they go away, but they come back a week later because they want to trade. And so,
*  that sort of gives the impression that they don't feel under threat by Whitman or his men at all.
*  – Right. No. So Whitman gives them some pieces of what they call manta or sort of calico cloth
*  and makes them some gifts. He's trying to develop some sort of relationship with these women. And
*  then I think the next step is that once the Apache women feel that he's not a threatening character,
*  and you have to realize that there are certain army units that have been out killing Apaches at
*  this time, then they send in some more people to negotiate with him. – Okay. And I mean, what he
*  says is he knows, Whitman's kind of a little torn here because he knows the peace policy,
*  says he needs to move all of the people in Arizona to Fort Apache, to the reservation there,
*  but they want to go somewhere else to that Garden of Eden that we described just at the beginning,
*  the place of water, this beautiful valley. So what goes through his head at the time? What's
*  he going to do about that? – Yeah, he's been placed in a very difficult position.
*  So there is only one reservation for Apaches in Arizona at the time. It's a fair amount to the
*  north. It's the famous or infamous Fort Apache reservation. And when he suggests that – And
*  is that good territory or is that very barren and neglected? – No, it's not bad, actually. It's
*  fairly cool. It's up in the hills. But what the leaders of the Apache, he meets with two Apache
*  leaders named Ashki Banzin and Captain Chiquito. And they say, well, that's not us. They're actually,
*  they're a group that's known as the Aravipa Apache who are from this region. And they say,
*  we are not part of that Apache group. This is part of the issue we were talking about in the
*  previous episode that the Apache are not a unified tribe. And so the army is trying to stick them all
*  in one place because you're all Apache, but they're actually – A whole constellation of different
*  gangs. Yeah. – They don't feel any kinship or, and they might even have some tension with that
*  group. So they don't want to move there. They want to be in this area that they're familiar with
*  and that they've long used, which is Aravipa Canyon. So they advocate for staying there. But
*  this places Whitman in a little bit of a problem because the peace policy is you're supposed to
*  help reform indigenous people, but he doesn't really have a reservation that he can put them
*  in. And so he de facto, in essence, begins to create a quasi-official, quasi-unofficial
*  reservation in Aravipa on the grounds initially of the Ford for these Apache people because he
*  sees if I don't do this, they'll probably leave and I'll be engaged in some sort of conflict with
*  them. And there's a chieftain, S.M.N.Z., who he's talking to. – Hashkevansson, yeah. – How do you
*  pronounce him? – Hashkevansson is what it would be. – Hashkevansson. – Hashkevansson, yeah. I'm not
*  super fluent in Apache, but that would be a little closer to then what you said. – Okay. And Hashkevansson
*  has no interest in being sort of pushed around, I guess. What does he say to Whitman? – He says,
*  you know, we don't want to go to Ford Apache. We're willing to, we like to stay here in Aravipa
*  Canyon. And his, you know, their community has long been based in Aravipa Canyon. – So, I mean,
*  are they happy with what he's offered, you know, this sort of makeshift reservation that he's trying
*  to put up? – I think so. I mean, well, certainly it's better because you have to realize that
*  if they're not on this reservation, they're vulnerable to being attacked by the army
*  and killed. And so, you know, the Apache are trying to, in essence, they're trying to do what
*  the U.S. wants them to do, which is to be on some sort of reservation. – To move to a safe zone,
*  in contemporary terminology. – Or a contained zone. – A contained zone. But some place where they
*  have a relationship with the army and feel that they won't be vulnerable to the kinds of spectacular
*  violence and surprise attacks that could happen otherwise from the army. – So, in this contained
*  zone, which is very near the camp, I mean, what kind of housing are we talking about? Are we talking
*  about the old adobe-style sort of dwellings that are hastily put up? – There's some photos of it,
*  which you can see that the camp really doesn't exist anymore. I've walked around where it used
*  to be. There's a flat area right where Aravipa Creek and San Pedro River meet. And that's where
*  it used, that was a parade ground of the camp. And there were sort of these adobe, you know,
*  using a Mexican technique, adobe houses for the soldiers. Initially, the Apaches are just making
*  their, what they call, wiki-ups often, sort of a brush shelter, with often would have a piece of
*  canvas over it. And that's where they're staying. They initially are staying quite close to the
*  soldiers. Once Whitman sort of feels, and what Whitman is doing, he's monitoring them quite
*  closely. So, every couple of days, he will go out and take roll call and count how many
*  Apaches are there. He's also trying during this time, and this is part of his reformer impulse,
*  feeling that he needs to teach the Apaches how to work and have been supporting themselves for
*  centuries, millennia, but he feels he has to teach them how to work. – Do we have a clear idea of
*  what he's teaching them? Is he doing pottery? – No, no, no. So, he wants them to go work as sort
*  of field hands. He will pay them, particularly Apache women, sort of little chits if they go
*  and collect grains for the horses for the soldiers, and then eventually he tries to set them to work
*  harvesting crops for nearby white settlers, sort of turning them into a working, labouring class
*  for the white settlers. And these chits, they can then trade for things that the Apaches want,
*  more cloth or things like that. – So, in his view, he's doing two things. He's both working
*  the peace policy to make sure that there's no violence, plus he's trying to, in his eyes,
*  civilize the savages. – But also cheap labour. – Yeah, cheap labour. – He's getting hay with horses.
*  – Yeah, he's teaching them about capitalism, but obviously, you know, whenever white settlers
*  are trying to teach native people about capitalism, they're usually trying to slot the native person
*  into that very bottom rung of the society. They're not making them into the entrepreneurs. They're
*  like, they want them to be the labouring class. So, that's what they're doing. And eventually,
*  it seems to, I think mainly for the safety reasons and also perhaps for the sense that they can get
*  some supplies, there's about 500 Apaches who come in to this site. – And mainly women and children,
*  not the men. – There's a combination of both. I think the men, you know, often during the US Army
*  policies, they would kill all the men. So, I think the men are a little more reticent about coming in.
*  But eventually, Whitman allows them to move upstream a little bit so they're not just on
*  the grounds of the Army fort, but they move about four or five miles into the canyon where it's
*  better watered and it's more lush down in that part. – But despite this, I mean, it feels like
*  a trusting act to say, okay, you know what, you can move a bit further so we don't count you every
*  morning. But there are settlers around the area who say, actually, no, hang on a minute, they're
*  raiding us, they're robbing from us. And there is a great cloud of suspicion that is swirling around
*  Camp Grant and Whitman himself. – Yeah. So, you know, Whitman is a new person in Arizona.
*  The local press in Tucson to the south, you have to realize as well, there's a sort of overlay of
*  the post-Civil War going on here. So, most of the whites in Tucson at this time were former Confederates.
*  And Whitman is a former Union officer, right? – Oh, very interesting. That's a whole different –
*  So they trust him and it's very right. – There's some built-in tension there. And then Whitman is seen as
*  coddling the Apaches when he should be out killing them or, you know, making the reservation to more
*  of a prison. And then one of the issues that we've talked about in the last episode is that the
*  Apaches are in a very large group and very dispersed. And so there are Apache raids taking place,
*  but the settlers in Tucson tend to think they're all from Camp Grant. And so that Whitman should
*  be punishing at least these Apaches, you know, that he's not being hard enough on them. – Right. Okay.
*  And some of the stories start to, you know, really take hold. So there is – the killing of the
*  Worcesters is not all that it seems. So we know we had extracts from the Arizona minor before,
*  which, you know, never backwards are coming forward spewing hatred against the native population.
*  God, what they would have made of this. So tell us about the Worcesters and their ranch and the
*  truth of the killing of the Worcesters. – Yeah, the Worcesters story is very interesting. And when
*  I finally unraveled it, I was quite, I don't know, a little proud of myself and sort of revealing,
*  because I think it was very revealing how this event gets misremembered. So, you know, there are
*  some killing of settlers that takes place and there's someone in a ranch just south of Tucson
*  in a place called Tubac where he is killed and there's a woman who is either various accounts
*  killed or taken captive. And eventually this gets made into the story that she is Worcester's wife
*  and she's pregnant, she's his white woman and sort of – so this is the – you can see the
*  tremendously fraught image of the white woman. – Well, they gave her a name, Leslie Worcester.
*  – Leslie Worcester. – Yeah.
*  – She'll carry on the, you know, the future of the white race and all of these sorts of things.
*  But it turns out that she's actually a Mexican woman named –
*  – Trinidad Aguirre. – Trinidad Aguirre,
*  Trinidad Aguirre. And she wasn't married to Worcester at all, she wasn't pregnant,
*  but she's sort of – I think later on after the spectacular violence takes place that they sort of
*  need a rationale and so they need to sort of think that they were acting to protect white women. One
*  of the things that's a little detail that's interesting too is that after the massacre,
*  they say, oh, we found this brooch which was belonging to Mrs. Worcester. But of course,
*  they found that afterwards and it's one of the things that never gets mentioned before
*  and it's not even clear they found it or it belonged to her. It was – I see this as very
*  close to the kind of narrative about imperiled white womanhood. – Yeah, this is in the aftermath
*  of 1857 when you had the women of Cornwall massacred and allegedly raped. The massacre was
*  true, the rape was not, but it became this great leitmotif and exactly this period in
*  India of having memorials erected all over India for these women and this fear of white women's
*  purity being somehow sullied by, quote, savages is very much in the air at this time.
*  – Well, I mean, the other issue that's happening in the US is that – so this is
*  immediately after the Civil War and the lynching narrative is getting produced in the US South,
*  which is the fear of white women being imperiled by freed African slaves. And in many respects,
*  you see a similar narrative being produced here in the West around white women being
*  threatened by native men. And so this, in both cases in the US, it generates the need for
*  tremendous retaliatory violence, right, because you have to protect white women at any cost.
*  – Right. So the way in which this starts off, you know, the blood is up because of this kind of
*  hashtag fake news, slightly fake news. I mean, we don't know who, you know, what happened to
*  Trinidad Aguilera, but we do know that something bad happened, but it wasn't to a woman called
*  Leslie. But they set up, they settled as a committee of public safety led by a man called
*  William Urie. Now tell us about William Urie. – Yes, tell us about him. Who is he?
*  – No, he's a fascinating character. One thing just important to sort of set him against
*  Royal Whitman is he's a southerner. So he's from Virginia. He goes out, I think he's one of the
*  younger sons, so sort of, you know, leaves the family plantation, goes out to Texas. There's some
*  stories that he actually was in the Alamo and briefly sort of was one of the last people to
*  send out to deliver a message before sent on an attack. That's a little bit difficult to decipher
*  because as I later discovered, a lot of people would claim to have been in the Alamo and they
*  weren't. – Never were.
*  – Because there was a lot of cache to that, obviously. But he was in Texas and we know he
*  was a Texas Ranger. He actually fought against Mexicans in the US-Mexico War.
*  – He's quite militaristic. – Militaristic. He does this very interesting thing then,
*  which is after the war, he actually marries a Mexican woman named Inez Cruz and he bounces
*  around, goes to California for the gold rush. But then in the 1850s, he ends up in Tucson and he
*  becomes the leading dairyman in person. He has a very large ranch which has dairy cattle.
*  – You guys have got to see the English. It's absolutely set at this time. It's about
*  particularly about herders who are trying to be cuddled.
*  – Well, Carl and I are going to watch it together. Watch it, okay? Right.
*  – But one of the things I want to underscore is that often the notion is that this violence
*  towards indigenous people was sort of done by the outcasts of society, right? But Uri is one of the
*  most successful, most prominent white settlers in Tucson at the time. And he's also, like a lot of
*  white settlers at the time, are actually intermarried with members of the Mexican community.
*  There's many more white men than white women at the time. So almost all the prominent men
*  are actually intermarried with Mexican women. So the point I really want to emphasize is that
*  the people who are leading this attack are not sort of these scoundrels and rogues or whatever,
*  the scum of society. They're like the leading figures. They're the cream of the crop such as
*  it was in Tucson at the time. – But Carl, you also make the point that the people who are gathering
*  around him are not just other white settlers. There's a whole racial mixture of people that
*  are going to come and join this lynch mob. – Yeah, so Tucson at the time is not a
*  predominantly Anglo city. Tucson has this very long history. It was originally a Tonoatum village.
*  It then becomes a Spanish settlement in a Mexican town and then eventually kind of the center of
*  Anglo-American Arizona. – And most importantly of all is the home of JJ Cale, we should say at
*  some point. – Oh, with the musician? I did not know that. Okay.
*  – So he's got a mixed racial group around him as well. I mean, we know he's married to a Mexican
*  woman. But I'm sort of interested in this plan of revenge that heats up in this boiling blood of
*  the fake Leslie attack story, Leslie Worcester story. Who is it who sort of surrounds him,
*  says we are with you no matter what you want to do? – So they have various meetings of this
*  committee on defense that they're supposed to be protecting themselves against the Apache.
*  And they eventually reach out to other groups that have their own sort of beefs with the Apache. So
*  one of these groups would be the Tonoatum who are the local indigenous people. And this is that
*  longer history that we were talking about in the first episode where there are indigenous tensions
*  that are actually sort of already there prior to the arrival of Europeans and then get exacerbated
*  by European colonialism. So the Tonoatum, in fact, some of the Tonoatum originally lived in
*  Aravai-Bacanian generations ago and were pushed out by the Apache. So I think they have their own.
*  – So they've got beef. – How does he know that? How would Uri have the local contacts?
*  – I don't know if he knows that older history, but he does know that they don't like them. That
*  during the Mexican period, the Tonoatum are often sort of auxiliaries with the Mexican forces.
*  And one of the people who led this, there was a very prominent Mexican family in town called the
*  Elias family led by two brothers. There's Jesus and there's also Juan Elias. And this was a group,
*  they had a, their ranch was very close to the Papago. And so I think that what happened is
*  Uri knew the Elias family, the Elias family knew the Papagos. And so you get this very
*  multicultural group. – Confederation of Revenge, I like to think of it. Whose idea is it to launch
*  an attack or a massacre on this campground? – I mean, it's a little, so supposedly the Committee
*  on Defense is, you know, they have this meeting and I think they're worked themselves up into
*  this fever pitch. What I think is quite interesting is when it ultimately becomes,
*  so that's predominantly Anglos at the time, but when it ultimately becomes time to go on the attack,
*  it's only six Anglos who participate, a larger group of Mexicans and then a large group of
*  indigenous people of Tono-Otom. And I think this is also interesting because, and it's somewhat
*  different around some of the other sort of infamous massacres that happened in this latter half of the
*  19th century, where it isn't just whites against indigenous people. You see this kind of very
*  broadcast of people, which I think allows you to get a sense of the deep history that's going on
*  here. There's indigenous tensions, there's tensions between Mexicans and indigenous people,
*  and there's also Anglos who are involved as well. – I'd say as a read, it hugely added to the kind
*  of nuance and the complexity of the story. That it's not just a John Wayne film in reverse with
*  incredibly virtuous people in black hats. – I mean, it's like we always say, it's not black and
*  white. Exactly. This is not a black and white story. But the attack itself with this, you know,
*  handful of American six, you said, and then others, this cast of others, they actually,
*  sadly on my birthday, 28th of April 1871, that they are going to hit the camp. How do they plan
*  to do this? What are they to all themselves up with? – Well, I mean, you have to realize what
*  they're doing is quite extreme because they're basically, the camp is right next to a US military
*  base. So they're almost, they're going against the US military, right? So it's a very vigilante
*  attack that they're planning. And one of the things they have to do is they cannot let the US
*  military know what they're doing. So they have to take a kind of less well-traveled back road.
*  – Avoiding the fort. – Avoiding the fort and avoiding sort of public roads that the army might
*  notice that they were on when they're going up there. – And what are they armed with? What have
*  they got? – Well, it depends a little bit on which participants you're talking about. So the
*  Tono O'Otham have come up with these very effective clubs. You know, you don't have to
*  stop and reload it or anything. They just will club people. – Made of wood. – Made of wood. Made of
*  mesquite wood, usually. But they also work their sort of connections. One of the officials in
*  Arizona is named Sam Hughes, and he has sort of the militia guns. And they get him to release some
*  of those guns more or less secretly to the Anglo-Mexican vigilantes so that they're very
*  well armed. – And these are, you refer to them, Sharps and Spencer carbines. – Sharps and Spencer
*  carbines. So I'm not an expert on the military hardware, but during the Civil War there's a
*  pretty rapid transformation in the technology of going from sort of single-shot muskets to more
*  rapid-firing guns. And so this is the latest military technology which will allow you to fire
*  multiple times against an enemy at this time. – Okay, so what we've got now is an impression of
*  people who are heavily, heavily armed. – Right. – Who are creeping up the back ways, you know,
*  to the top of steep bluffs. They're overlooking the Aravapa Canyon. And is there positioning with
*  the guns? Is that so that if anyone runs away from what is about to happen, they will be shot
*  rather than be allowed to escape? – Yes. I mean, so it was really powerful to walk in illuminating
*  and a sort of gruesome way to walk Aravapa Canyon, which I ultimately did with some of the
*  members of the survivors' families. And, you know, it has a very steep sort of gullies. And so
*  the camp was all on the floor of the valley right along the creek where the Apaches were. And so
*  the attackers, the Anglos and the Mexicans seemingly are up mainly on the hill with the guns.
*  And then the Tonawatham, who are the majority, are run into the encampments. And because they
*  have clubs, they can also begin to kill people quietly, silently. And then once the Apaches
*  awaken and try to flee, then they're supposed to be picked off by the, kind of the snipers on the
*  top of the bluffs. – So it's quite well planned. These guys know what they're doing. – Yeah. I mean,
*  the fact that they killed, it's a little hard to know exact numbers, but somewhere almost around
*  150 Apaches and don't lose a person in the attack suggests how asymmetrical it is, right? It's the
*  element of surprise, but also how well armed they are. And also the way the landscape just bottles
*  in the Apaches, it's very hard to, it would be very hard to get up the faces of that canyon
*  and escape. You have to run deeper into the canyon. – A few people hide in the brush.
*  – Yeah, or hide in the brush and try to escape that way. – I mean, the way you describe it and
*  the way William beautifully read it at the beginning of the program, it just, I'm minded of those awful
*  scenes, you know, when hunters went out on the ice and just clubbed baby seals, you know, that
*  you've got children who are completely defenseless or people who are completely asleep and not doing
*  anything, who are just wiped out by this sort of very brutal shattering of skulls and bones.
*  – Yeah. I mean, it's just, I don't know what else to say. It's just complete violence and complete
*  gruesome. – Well, look, on this miserable picture, which, you know, we began with,
*  let's take a break. And then when we come back from the break, let's talk about what
*  happens in the aftermath of this bloodlet. –
*  – It's an April morning in 1871, and Lieutenant Whitman is just tucking into his breakfast when
*  a messenger arrives to say that something terrible is about to happen. Tell us about this, Carl
*  Treckinby. – Yes. So, Lieutenant Whitman is the officer in command of Camp Grant, and he's about
*  to eat breakfast, and he gets the message that there is a group of vigilantes who are about to
*  attack the Apache encampment, which is on the incipient or quasi-reservation that's located
*  very close to his establishment. They're about five miles apart where his camp, where his
*  headquarters are and where the Apaches are camping. – So just out of, he can't hear the shots of the
*  – You can't, no. So just out of your range. – Of the rifles picking down the people trying to climb up the
*  canyon. He hasn't heard any of that. – Yeah, so Whitman goes there and he's the first sort of
*  written eyewitness accounts we have of the aftermath of the massacre. Just, you know,
*  bodies strewn everywhere, some of them mutilated, and a lot of the Apaches traumatized. – Many of
*  them kids, some of them women. – Kids, exactly, kids, young women. And then a lot of the Apaches
*  are traumatized and don't want to speak to him. And I think part of this is just the trauma of
*  what they've gone through. Part of it also is, to be honest, the Apaches don't know. They thought
*  maybe they could trust Whitman, but they don't know. Was he involved in this particular? Did he
*  let them in? You know, was he involved in this massacre? So it's a very kind of fraught and
*  horrific moment. The reason that Whitman didn't find out earlier is that the party who was going
*  out to attack from Tucson, they took this back route, but they were very worried that the army
*  would find out about it. So they actually sent some men to block any transmissions along the
*  main route, goes from Tucson to Camp Cran. – So I mean, so well planned. So, you know, this is an
*  extermination that's very well planned. I'm just going to read a little bit of what Whitman saw
*  when he went into this camp for the first time. I saw the dead bodies of several women that I
*  recognized, he says. Two were lying on their backs entirely naked and shot through the breast,
*  apparently, with pistol balls. I saw the dead bodies of children, perhaps six. They had died,
*  apparently, by gunshot wounds. I recollect one child, perhaps two years of age, with the arm
*  neatly cut off. Besides an old man, the only other dead body of a male was a boy, perhaps he
*  was 16 years of age. So just to give you an idea of what he walked into when he did finally get
*  the messenger. – Predominantly women and children, right, which are the almost always in these kinds
*  of attacks. They're the most vulnerable, they're the least able to escape. And so it sort of just
*  emphasizes the extermination, the exterminatory aspect of it because they're killing women and
*  children. – Now, Carl, you give an impression that the local press immediately jumps in,
*  giving a very slanted account and initially proclaiming the massacre as a great victory
*  against violent Apache tribesmen. Whitman begins to fight back on that with a more sober account
*  of a massacre, doesn't he? – Yes, well, I mean, the word massacre that you mentioned is kind of
*  the key term. So initially in the press, it's not called a massacre, it's called a victory.
*  And the notion here is that they've protected, it's not seen as an act of aggression, it's seen
*  as an act of protection for the settlers. – Self-defense is how they describe it.
*  These guys have the right to self-defense. – Against the Apache violence. And then Whitman
*  ultimately begins to disrupt that by writing some letters that get published in some of the press,
*  not the local Arizona press, which hates Whitman, but in some of the Eastern press.
*  And this creates this whole debate about what is this? Is this a massacre? Is this a righteous
*  self-defense? And so that's one of the sort of debates that lingers over this. – And this
*  provides a whole series of inquiries that give you your raw material. You have an amazing amount of
*  raw material to work with when you're writing this book. – Because there's a trial eventually. I mean,
*  it takes a while, but I mean, there is a trial for this, isn't there? – Yeah, but because…
*  So this thing becomes a cause-celebrity. You have to realize this is happening at Camp Grant,
*  which is named after President Ulysses S. Grant, who was president at the time,
*  who was the author of the peace policy. So it's not just a… It is a horrific massacre, but it's a
*  horrific massacre that really cuts this issue about what is the peace policy in the first place.
*  And it's really an attack on the, you know, the federal control of Indian policy and
*  General Grant himself, President Grant himself. – And his authority, yeah. It's a PR nightmare,
*  as they'd say today. – Yeah, so Grant comes out very strongly against it. He calls it murder
*  in an interview that he does. And so, you know, prior to this, there had never ever, I mean,
*  tremendous acts of violence against Indigenous people. You know, William mentioned this before,
*  they're poisoning Indigenous people in Arizona with strychnine. None of that had ever been
*  brought to trial. There never had ever been in Arizona any trial of any white person for killing
*  a Native person before this. But because this is such a horrific event, because of the fact that
*  it's so closely linked to General Grant himself, President Grant, I should say, at this point,
*  there really is a lot of pressure from the federal government that you have to bring a trial. There
*  has to be a trial of these people because this is such an awful event. – Yeah, and really, I mean,
*  there's some real horrors in this. If you want to do a law and order corruption special, here you go.
*  One of the men who's the district attorney at the time not only had advanced knowledge of the
*  attack, but participated in several of the meetings that planned and led up to the attack.
*  This is going to be a great movie when they make one, Carl. Uri, just to say again, he's a big
*  herdsman. He's got huge hordes, so he employs hundreds of people. – I don't know if hundreds.
*  I mean, Tucson's a pretty small place at the time, but he's, you know, he's very influential. He's
*  really well regarded. – He's the dairy farmer. He's the big cheese. And we can put it that way.
*  Literally the big cheese. – One of the other participants, Sidney DeLong, gets elected mayor
*  just a couple weeks after the massacre. And I have to believe the fact that Sidney DeLong was known
*  to have participated in the massacre was actually a political plus at that particular time. – So,
*  I mean, it does seem like the whole system is corrupt. Let's just very briefly go through what
*  the trial ended up with because I'm very keen to talk about what this means today to Native Americans.
*  So, I mean, just what happens? So how does the trial conclude and where does it leave everybody?
*  – So, like I said, this is the first trial ever in Arizona for a white person for killing
*  Indigenous people. They actually put on trial not just the whites, but they also put on trial
*  a number of the Mexicans and a large number of the Tono-Otomans Indians as well. There's something
*  like over 100 people put on trial. And in fact, the very first photo we have of Tucson is a photo
*  that was taken outside of the courthouse of all of the defendants sitting there, which I think shows
*  how this event was so integral to creating the history of the region. So they have a multi-day
*  trial. And for me as a historian, this was great because there was a transcript actually that I was
*  able to locate at the trial. So you have direct testimony of some of these people who are participating.
*  – Was this something you found, Carl, that had never been used before in the accounts?
*  – I don't think it ever had been. There had been very little writing about the Camp Grant Massacre
*  and I actually ended up putting it on a website that I can give you guys the link to.
*  – Yes, we'll put that in our newsletter, which anyone who is a member of the Empire Club gets.
*  – But then the judge basically gives a very sort of weighted or slanted…
*  – Direction.
*  – Direction to the jury, almost sort of giving up the notion of self-defense as the rationale for
*  what they did. And then the jury goes and it's 19 minutes or something.
*  – 19 minutes.
*  – They come back with a verdict of non-guilty. The other thing that's interesting is that there
*  is no… So they call some of the Anglos settlers, they call actually at least one of the Tonawotham
*  leaders there, they call some of the Mexicans as well. They don't call any Apaches to the stand,
*  so we never get the whole trial transcript gives you sort of three sides of the story,
*  but the fourth side, which would be most important, which would be the Apache side,
*  they're never called, they would never be thought to appear as witnesses in the trial.
*  – Carl, do you have any Apache sources at all about the massacre?
*  – There are some oral histories that were done of survivors in the early 20th century.
*  One of the very early anthropologists among the Apache who learned Apache named Granville Goodwin
*  went out and took accounts, so we do have some of those. And there are stories that
*  Apaches have passed down about the massacre, although we can talk about this more. It's actually
*  within Apache culture, it's interesting. I think Western historians like to dig into this gruesome
*  stuff and within Apache culture, it's often seen as not healthy, psychically healthy to be
*  investigating death and destruction and such terrible things. And it was a little bit…
*  It made me feel quite ghoulish actually when I first came to the reservation because I'd be like,
*  let's talk about this terrible massacre. And they're a little bit like, what is wrong with you?
*  And that I did actually, I have to say writing this book was, it took me to some dark places
*  because it's a very grim story. And there were moments when I thought, I think the Apache maybe
*  have a better attitude about this, that you're not supposed to talk about the dead and not really
*  wallow in it so much. – Perhaps, but it is a milestone because what it tells Native Americans,
*  no matter what tribe they come from, is that you will not get justice here. This will happen and
*  you will not get justice here. I mean, let's talk about where we are today because we do have
*  Native American reservations even to this day. You say you went to the reservation to talk to
*  people who were descended from. What is the situation with, what is left of these tribes
*  that once lived and inhabited most of the United States? – So most of the survivors of the Camp
*  Grant Massacre moved to a reservation that's known as St. Carlos Indian Reservation. And in some ways,
*  it's a very beautiful spot, although it's not the lush spot that Aravipa was. And the soldiers
*  who were stationed there early used to call it Hell's 40 Acres or something because it was so hot
*  there. But one of the things that was striking early on when the book was published, I actually
*  did a presentation in Tucson with an Apache elder. And this was, the book was published in 2008. So
*  this was right during the so-called Great Recession in the United States. The unemployment rate had
*  hit 10% or something in the United States and people were just freaking out about how terrible
*  this economy was. And the Apache elder said, you know, that's maybe bad, but you have to realize
*  the unemployment rate on St. Carlos is 50%, something like that. And that's every year,
*  like that's not just this one year where we're seeing this as a crisis. It's just a constant
*  economic challenge. – What are the trades, what do people do today to get by in these reservations?
*  – Well, you know, they have a casino. I mean, part of the issue, which I think is related to
*  this history is they're in a very isolated spot. They're not there. They're eventually pushed into
*  a spot that's way off from Tucson and way off from Phoenix. So it's not like you could commute to
*  those places to work. There's not a lot of industry. So they have a tribal herd of cattle that they
*  raise. They have a casino. People do beautiful arts and crafts and there's not a lot of tourists
*  coming by. It's hard to sell them. So it's a very culturally rich area, but it's a very economically
*  depressed area. – We talked about Hollywood representations of the Old West. I mean, the ones,
*  there are revisionist TV programs at least, which are trying to address the kind of situation that
*  now Indians on reservations are facing. I'm thinking of Yellowstone in particular, the one,
*  the Kevin Costner one, where they are. – I've never watched Yellowstone.
*  – At least I've been watching far too much telly and not studying enough history.
*  – It's kind of interesting. I mean, it's a popular series, American series, but it is,
*  it does address some of the historic steps which led to men owning huge swathes of America now and
*  who lived there before and that kind of thing. The Indian casino, I mean, you touched on it has a
*  casino and that is one of the things that popular culture often associates with Indian reservations,
*  that there's a casino. Just, I mean, for those who don't know, why is that a thing that happens?
*  – Because of the Indian Gaming Act, it's basically seen that the Indigenous people
*  have the right as part of their sovereignty to run casinos on their land if they want.
*  One of the aftermaths of this is the Tono-O'-Otham also have their casino, but the Tono-O'-Otham are
*  closer to Tucson and so their casino is much more robust and flourishing than the Apache
*  casino, which is in the middle of nowhere and so it doesn't really get that many tourists there.
*  – Are there, I mean, all of the depictions I've seen in modern popular culture are of
*  misery, deprivation, unemployment, addiction issues, that kind of thing. Do you have some happy,
*  happy ever after stories that you might share? – Well, I think, I mean, I'm saying as an outsider,
*  I mean, I've made some good friends. I think there's some amazing, the culture and everything
*  else, but I do think that economically they're quite challenged and I think that the United
*  States has not even begun to face up to the ways that they've sort of structurally disempowered
*  and impoverished these people. I feel like there's a slow violence, you know, we talk about
*  this kind of fast violence during the 19th century of the Camp Grant massacre, but there's a slow
*  violence of economic deprivation, which then leads to substance abuse issues, which then leads to,
*  you know, unemployment and all of those other sorts of issues, which just leads to,
*  it just makes for a very difficult situation for the Apache.
*  – Do you feel that the kind of history you've been writing, Carl, which tells the unvarnished
*  truth about how the West was won and that it was won with extreme violence and with something
*  approaching genocide and ethnic cleansing, is that widely known? When your students come to
*  Columbia and study with you, are they aware what their history is or do you constantly have them
*  with their jaws dropping to the ground and saying, I don't know, and it's fair?
*  – It's interesting. I think on some level, and Columbia students are a very particular group,
*  but on some level, I think most Americans realize that they don't know the specifics,
*  but I think they realize there were these tremendous crimes that have enabled non-Indigenous
*  people to enjoy the vast majority of the continent at the expense of Indigenous people. They don't
*  know the specifics. Camp Grant and very few people had really talked about it until I wrote the book.
*  – Is it changing? Do you find that there's now, I mean, just making the series over the last
*  five, six episodes, we've seen a great deal of very good new work and some really remarkable
*  writing, some of it from Native American historians. – It's definitely changing within the academy.
*  One question I always ask myself as a scholar is to how much does this really get out? And I think
*  one of the difficult parts is we write our books and all of that, but so many Americans get their
*  history, as it were, from TV shows and movies, and it's very, very hard for us to undo a lot of that.
*  And so I certainly don't feel that most Americans, although I certainly would, would describe what
*  happened to Indigenous people as a genocide. People sometimes get very angry when I talk about
*  it that way. – Do you have that? We all sit here writing Imperial history and trying to work against
*  the grain with some of the stuff the British did. And we both have colleagues who, one, David Dona
*  Sugar, who has to go to book festivals with a bodyguard, and another, Satnam Sangero, who gets
*  sacks full of hate mail. Do you get a bit of that when you go around America telling people that
*  ancestors were war criminals? – I guess I'm not famous enough for that to have happened.
*  So I haven't. One thing I did do actually after this, it was very interesting, one of the members
*  of the Elias family, who is the Mexican who guides the group that attacks Camp Grant, he reached out
*  to me and I knew some of the members of Capitan Chiquito's family, the Apache family. And so we
*  actually were able to have a lunch together in Tucson, which was very interesting. – With the
*  victim and the perpetrators' descendants? – I didn't have any of the Uri family, so there's
*  sort of a limit. I've never had anyone from the Uri family reach out to me. – They're still around,
*  are they still raunching? – I don't know actually. So he only had one daughter, so I don't know. I
*  don't think the Uri name is there and I don't know exactly what happened. His daughter married
*  a US Army officer, but again, sort of where that family ends up going, I don't actually know.
*  Well look, we may not know that, but we know so much more than when we started. Thank you so much
*  for being with us. Carl Jacobi, the author of The Excellent Shadows Adorn the Apache Massacre and
*  Violence of History. – What we haven't perhaps said as clearly as we should is that Carl's book
*  is not only an extraordinary masterpiece of research, it's also, as we saw at that reading
*  at the beginning, absolutely beautifully written and deeply moving. And it's very beautifully
*  written, the way that you study it from four different angles, all the different participants,
*  and yet there's no repetition, there's no feeling that you're going over the same ground. It's very
*  cleverly written. I thought it was a wonderful piece of writing as well as an extraordinary
*  piece of research. – Thank you. I was really trying to break with the usual narrative mode
*  when telling this story, which I thought was really important in trying to tell a story that's this
*  complicated and this violent. – Thank you very much, Carl. So that's all from us, from me,
*  William Dalrymple, and me, Anita Arland. Till the next time we meet, goodbye.
