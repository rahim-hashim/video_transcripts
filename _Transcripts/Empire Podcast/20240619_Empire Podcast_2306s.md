*  Hello and welcome to Empire with me, Anita Arnan.
*  And me, William Durranpool.
*  And once again, I'm delighted to say we are joined by Kathleen Duval.
*  I'm enjoying her company so much, author of the recently published book, Native Nations,
*  a Millennium in North America.
*  And a fabulous, fabulous book it is too.
*  It's given us so much to talk about both in the pod, but also outside the pod.
*  William and I have been talking about things that have thrown up.
*  Full of surprises in every chapter.
*  It's one of those ones you read and you start sort of WhatsApping each other, going, did
*  you read?
*  Did you?
*  Had you heard?
*  And the answer mostly is no, I hadn't.
*  I just wondered before we get into the next amazing story that you have to tell.
*  We should have a little spoiler alert that this is going to be...
*  Well, he loves a spoiler.
*  It's a sad story, I'm afraid.
*  Go get your tissues.
*  Just be ready.
*  You've been dowel-rimpled.
*  I was just going to ask though, how much do Americans acknowledge this kind of scholarship
*  and this history?
*  Because it's an uncomfortable history.
*  Listen, how much pushback do you get for it?
*  I think Americans are eager for this kind of understanding.
*  I think that today non-native Americans see Native Americans in movies and TV.
*  There have been some really important US Supreme Court cases lately.
*  Art museums are doing lots of contemporary Native art.
*  I think trying to square that really noticeable presence of Native Americans these days with
*  history that most people were told of Native Americans very quickly declining and not being
*  particularly important after the early 19th century, it's kind of a disconnect.
*  I feel like there are audiences in the United States that are really eager for histories
*  that help them understand that and correct that old way they were taught history.
*  For many, I've got lots of American friends.
*  One of them was describing to me is you learn a little bit and then it's as if they've
*  all been taken away by the rapture.
*  No one talks about it.
*  What happened here?
*  Where'd they go?
*  Right.
*  Then you're like, wait, why are they on TV shows now?
*  What happened in between?
*  Do you still do land acknowledgments?
*  I've just come back just in case if it's a distant memory now, but I was in Canada a
*  few months ago.
*  They start every big sporting event with a land acknowledgement.
*  Likewise in Australia, they will do a land acknowledgement.
*  We should say for those who don't know what a land acknowledgement is, it is just taking
*  a moment at the beginning before you do anything else saying this land used to belong to and
*  we acknowledge.
*  Does that still happen in America?
*  Yes, to some extent.
*  There definitely has been a move even more recently to add on the end of that a connection
*  to the present day because I think what a lot of Native people don't like about land
*  acknowledgments is they kind of replicate that same story that Native Americans are
*  just in the past.
*  This land used to belong to them, right?
*  As true as that is, for example, there are various land acknowledgments that we use here
*  at the University of North Carolina, but they all connect to North Carolina tribes today
*  and mention, okay, there are also still Native nations within North Carolina.
*  When you fly in for our festival in Boulder, you arrive at the airport in Detroit.
*  You go along as you arrive in through this long hall of photographs of Native American
*  tribes, beautiful 19th century photography of these people.
*  It's very striking, they're very present.
*  Present, but not so much around Boulder, actually.
*  That's because of the Creek Massacre, which I think we'll be talking about in our next
*  issue, actually.
*  I always find the juxtaposition of that really odd, but you know, sort of places where you
*  go where there's a great deal of art and declaration of how important people were and then you
*  don't see the people.
*  Anyway, enough of that.
*  Press pause on that.
*  Right, have you got your tissue boxes?
*  Are you ready?
*  Why don't you kick off this rather extraordinary story, Willie?
*  So yes, Kathleen, very, very striking moment in your book is set shortly after the Declaration
*  of Independence and we have this extraordinary figure who you paint a beautiful pen portrait
*  of and am I pronouncing his name right?
*  Tecumseh, born in what, 1768?
*  Tell us about him.
*  Yeah, so he and his brother, Tenskwatawa, are born to a Shawnee family in the very late
*  18th century and they're born during this long series of wars we mentioned in the last
*  episode between the Shawnees and their allies, other native nations in the Ohio Valley and
*  the United States, starting with the British colonies and then the United States.
*  And so they come of age during this era of war.
*  By the time they're young men, their father's been killed in battles against the United
*  States.
*  Some of their older brothers are killed as well.
*  Their mother has actually moved west with some other Shawnees as part of a group that
*  has decided defending the Ohio Valley is no longer tenable and that it will be easier
*  to live and to live as Shawnees if they leave their homeland and move west to the Mississippi.
*  But Tecumseh and his brother, Tenskwatawa, stay in the Ohio Valley with their older siblings.
*  And they're very impressive.
*  One Brit who comes across them writes, a more sagacious or more gallant warrior does not,
*  I believe, exist.
*  He was the admiration of everyone who conversed with him.
*  Right.
*  So you can hear in that he is a great warrior, but he's also a great speaker.
*  And Tenskwatawa, his brother, becomes a prophet.
*  He has a vision of continuing this confederacy to fight the United States, but going even
*  further.
*  So his vision says, God is angry that Europeans have basically messed everything up.
*  Europeans came to a continent that wasn't intended for them.
*  They stole people from Africa and brought them here to...
*  And they are the offspring of the evil spirit.
*  Right, right, right.
*  God created Europeans, but he just meant them to stay in Europe.
*  But yeah, people of the United States, they are the offspring of the evil spirit.
*  So Tenskwatawa, Tecumseh's brother, says all Native Americans need to combine as one people.
*  That's what God intended.
*  And we have to kick Europeans off of our continent.
*  And this could be a game changing moment.
*  That's right.
*  That's right.
*  Joseph becomes the greatest evangelist for this movement.
*  He's a great speaker, as we said.
*  He travels around.
*  He travels to the Muscogees and the Cherokees and the Southwest.
*  He travels west to the Mississippi and speaks to the Osage and other people west of the
*  Mississippi.
*  And really, they have in mind something much bigger than the confederacies of the past,
*  but a real united Native identity, not just a military alliance.
*  I mean, these two brothers, it's nominative determinism in many ways, because isn't it
*  right?
*  Tecumseh means shooting star, and he's the one who wants people to follow him.
*  And they do follow him.
*  And then Tenskwatawa means the noisemaker.
*  And he is the prophet who's denouncing the evil spawn of the colonizers.
*  And he's the one who is making all the noise in many ways.
*  Right.
*  And then he changes his name to the open door.
*  So God speaks through him to the people.
*  Yeah.
*  So they also believe we can change your names along the way.
*  Can I just break into the story at this point, Cathy, just to have an idea of what the conception
*  of God that we're talking about here?
*  Tenskwatawa refers to him, and he uses a male pronoun, as the master of life.
*  And so I think that kind of language, you know, you would have said it in Shawnee too,
*  to translate it back into Shawnee.
*  That language, it sort of bridges long traditional religious beliefs of Shawnees with Christianity.
*  With monotheism, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  The Shawnees have lived alongside Christianity for many generations by this point.
*  And I think one of the important things to know about Native religions is that they are
*  inclusivist, which means that they aren't all or nothing religions the way Christianity
*  and Islam and Judaism all are, at least in theory, that you are that religion or you
*  aren't that religion.
*  And Native religions, for the most part, believe that if you come across a belief practice
*  that makes sense, you can incorporate it alongside your beliefs.
*  More like Hinduism in that sense.
*  That's right.
*  Exactly right.
*  Right.
*  You don't have to give up your old beliefs and practices to embrace new ones.
*  And so Christianity has become part of the theology of Shawnees, of many Shawnees, at
*  least by this point.
*  So you definitely see parallels in how Ten Square Tawa talks, even though at the very
*  same time it's a completely nativistic religion which wants to expel all European influences
*  and sort of get at the difficulties he's going to have because he's not going to be able
*  to expel generations of contact with Europeans.
*  There's the rub, as many may say, Luke.
*  You talk the talk, but they also walk the walk.
*  They establish a town, prophet's town in modern day Indiana.
*  What would that have been like when Tecumseh founded it with his brother?
*  So the idea is to make all Native people one.
*  So one of the things they have to do is to get Shawnees and Delawares, Potawatomies and
*  everybody else to leave their tribal communities and move in together.
*  And one of the purposes is to get them away from their town leaders, from their national
*  leaders.
*  They don't really seize as opposing this movement.
*  They are invested in separate nations, the Shawnees being different from other Native
*  peoples, even if they have a military alliance with them.
*  So prophet's town is this place that Ten Square Tawa found to bring his converts together.
*  One of the problems he has is he has a much easier time converting men than women.
*  Women are the farmers still among Shawnees and others in the region, and they don't want
*  to leave their farms. And they also don't want to stop using some of the metal tools
*  that they use that make farming easier.
*  They say we can be Native, we can be Shawnee and still use a metal hoe.
*  It doesn't keep us from being who we are.
*  He's totally advocating removing all Western technology.
*  All Western technologies and all parts of their religion that seem Western to him and
*  also splitting apart families.
*  If you're intermarried with a white trader and you have children that husband, those
*  children are not supposed to be part of this new society.
*  Right. OK, so they would be cast out too.
*  I mean, there's some disagreement about whether the children have to be cast out or
*  not, but certainly the husband.
*  So it's very radical.
*  Yes. And lots of Shawnees and other Native people do not like it.
*  But also, I mean, it's food and clothes, alcohol and sort of means of cooking and
*  things like that, which some people have grown to like.
*  Exactly right. And Shawnee women have developed ways of making clothing that you
*  can't easily separate the Shawnee from the European in it by the early 1800s.
*  That's fascinating. OK, so does Prophet's Town prosper and grow or is it just a is it
*  a man only factory?
*  I mean, what is it?
*  What does it look like?
*  There are a couple of women there, but there aren't enough farmers.
*  They rely on food coming in from Potawatomi and other towns nearby.
*  Women who are farming within their own towns there.
*  But the Americans see this as tremendously successful, as a huge threat.
*  And the United States sends William Henry Harrison to root it out.
*  When is this sort of recognized as a threat?
*  What's happening on the seaboard?
*  It's very quickly and it's in a time it were right before the War of 1812.
*  But tensions are rising between the United States and Britain.
*  And in retrospect, we know it's moving toward all out war.
*  And do the British realize they've got a potential ally in this guy?
*  Yes. Right. And to come to make sure the British realize that, I talked about to
*  comes to going around and making great speeches to other native nations.
*  But he does the same thing with the British.
*  He goes up to Canada and advocates a grand alliance.
*  Does he take their guns?
*  Absolutely. So that's a bit off, isn't it?
*  He can use the guns, but the women can't use the hoe.
*  Exactly. And we can ally with the British, even though we may not mention to them
*  our long term strategy is having no Europeans here.
*  It's like problems here.
*  So who strikes the first blow?
*  Is it Henry Harrison, who's William Henry Harrison, who's been told to get this
*  situation under control?
*  We should explain who he is, the Indiana Territory Governor.
*  Right. So it's a little contested who actually fires first.
*  It escalates into warfare.
*  It comes to actually isn't even there.
*  He's off on one of his tours.
*  So Tenskwatawa is there to defend Prophetstown, although he really to his
*  his followers, he's talking about it as an offensive move.
*  He thinks they're going to win a big battle against Harrison.
*  And that will be the first step in this plan to throw Europeans
*  and their descendants off of the continent.
*  Doesn't work. Harrison comes in and the people of Prophetstown have to disperse.
*  They lose the battle. Harrison declares great victory, although actually
*  Tenskwatawa's followers actually reconvene pretty soon thereafter.
*  They're not slaughtered. They just leave. They run away.
*  They're losing the battle and some of them are killed and they retreat,
*  which is quite common in native warfare, all warfare, right, to retreat
*  if you're losing and try to fight another day.
*  Retreat, regroup, retreat, regroup.
*  That's not going to be enough for William Henry Harrison,
*  because he knows that they can just regroup a few days down the track.
*  So what is the next move here?
*  It all grows into the War of 1812, breaks out and Tecumseh leads
*  as many native followers as he can to side with the British
*  and fight against the United States to take advantage of the War of 1812.
*  So some of our listeners will not know the story of this war
*  when the White House gets burned down by the British.
*  Yes. Yes, we should tell this story.
*  You're quite right to put us up on this because we've been talking about this for ages,
*  but others may not.
*  Give us a little introduction to that war.
*  OK, so the United States, I'm going to say unwisely,
*  goes to war again against Britain.
*  They've tried their luck once. Exactly.
*  As we often do from history, we learn the wrong lessons.
*  The United States in its early years is pulled back and forth
*  between the French, whom they had allied with during the revolution,
*  and the British, of course, whom they fought against in the revolution,
*  but have more in common with, right, and sort of more natural economic ties with.
*  And so every time Europe, particularly the British and the French, go to war,
*  the United States tries to stay neutral and just profit off of it
*  and has a lot of trouble doing that.
*  So unwisely jumps into another war against Britain in the War of 1812.
*  And the British march southwards deep into the United States.
*  Britain is involved in wars on the continent at the same time.
*  But when it's able, the British are able to free up enough troops
*  to invade actually the United States.
*  They march on the capital.
*  They march on Washington, D.C. to burn the capital.
*  Burn the White House.
*  It's odd. This isn't something we learn in our history lessons.
*  The Brits would like it, you'd have thought. But no.
*  Yeah, no, I know. It's odd, isn't it?
*  But I mean, they've just literally just cleaned out the White House
*  and made it habitable. And then it's burnt down.
*  I mean, it's not that old.
*  The paint has hardly dried and they burn it down.
*  In fact, the story goes, and I don't know if this is true,
*  but the story goes it only becomes the White House afterwards
*  because of all the whitewash they had to put on it to try to cover up the burn marks.
*  You know what? I'd love that to be true, because that's a gorgeous story.
*  I suspect it's not.
*  Oh, let it be. You spoil sport.
*  Anyway, what's happening to the cumbersome at this point?
*  It's looking pretty good.
*  It's looking like this may be the first step in kicking out the United States.
*  Are the Brits trying to recover the United States?
*  They think they can get it back?
*  I don't know. Yeah, I'm not sure about that.
*  They certainly don't.
*  But the United States absolutely think that people in the United States
*  think Canadians are going to come rushing to it.
*  The British are coming again.
*  So at first, the British and Tecumseh's forces are winning.
*  But at the same time, we talked about the sort of prophecies
*  and prescriptions of Tenskwatawa and Tecumseh.
*  They have turned off an awful lot of native people.
*  And so there end up being some native men who fight on the side of the United States,
*  many who work on the side of the United States as scouts and others
*  who in some ways see Tecumseh as a greater threat.
*  There's a zealot, some kind of sort of ideological zealot who's just unreasonable.
*  Exactly. That's right.
*  And in fact, Tenskwatawa has led some witch hunts and killed people
*  within the Delawares and the Shawnees who didn't agree with him.
*  It really is internally a lot of debates and some violence about it.
*  So Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa really don't win the battle for native allegiance.
*  They have some allies, but some enemies.
*  Yeah. Relatively few.
*  Most Shawnees don't side with them even.
*  Really? Yeah.
*  And then eventually the British and Tecumseh's forces start to lose battles
*  and have to retreat back into Canada.
*  And so Tecumseh is with the British forces as they retreat.
*  And in October 1813, there's a fatal clash.
*  The Battle of the Thames, which is not our Thames, but your Thames.
*  The Canadian Thames River.
*  So the British are on the run by this point.
*  The US win again at the Battle of the Thames and Tecumseh is killed at that battle.
*  How exactly is Tecumseh killed? Do we know?
*  Yeah, lots of different tales of how exactly.
*  William Henry Harrison goes on to claim the battle as part of his campaigning
*  when he runs for president eventually.
*  It's actually his campaign slogan is Tipa Kanu and Tyler too.
*  Tyler is his vice presidential running mate.
*  But Tipa Kanu is the battle against Prophetstown that we talked about earlier.
*  I see. Right.
*  That echoes through American political history.
*  It's actually someone different who claims to have personally killed Tecumseh
*  and also built his own sort of career out of that.
*  But with the death of Tecumseh, the death of Prophetstown,
*  the death of that idea of a unified nation of nations, that dies with both of them.
*  That's right. And the eventual end of the War of 1812.
*  In the treaty that ends the War of 1812,
*  the treaty leaves most things exactly the way they were before the war began.
*  But the British do exact out of the United States
*  a commitment to basically leave native nations in the Ohio Valley
*  and the Great Lakes region alone.
*  And perhaps even there's a hint in there that there will be a separate nation,
*  actual sovereign place between Canada and the United States there
*  that's controlled and ruled by native nations.
*  That's not the way it goes down, people.
*  Join us after the break.
*  Keep those hankies close.
*  Welcome back.
*  So just before we went to break, we were talking about this end of Prophetstown,
*  the fall at Tecumseh and this idea that Native American tribes
*  will be left alone in the Ohio Valley and they'll be untroubled.
*  But then two names to present to you, Andrew and Jackson.
*  Andrew Jackson has very different ideas.
*  First of all, can you give us a pen portrait of Jackson?
*  What was he like? Where did he come from?
*  What's his Marvel origin story?
*  He comes out of the United States, he's a man of the world.
*  He's a teenager during the American Revolution.
*  So he's got this story of coming of age during the founding of the United States.
*  He's born in either North Carolina or South Carolina.
*  So in one of the original states.
*  In poverty, huh?
*  In poverty, right.
*  He gets a law degree and moves to Tennessee.
*  So Tennessee is across the Appalachian Mountains from North Carolina.
*  It's one of the new territories that will become a state
*  the next generation after the revolution.
*  He was born in the United States.
*  He's a slave holder.
*  He has a hundred slaves. He's a serious slave.
*  He's kind of a founding father trajectory for this guy.
*  But also he's got a virulent anti-British strand,
*  because I mean, it's said that his mother and his brother
*  are killed during that battle for independence.
*  And he's tough and quite wild and quite aggressive.
*  Red hair, angry, as angry as his hair is red.
*  Oh, it's a bad side. My wife has got a little of that.
*  Your wife is a saint.
*  That's a very good point.
*  Your wife is a saint.
*  Your wife is a saint.
*  Your wife is a saint.
*  She's a pre-Raphaelite beauty and a saint.
*  Do not go there at all.
*  Team Olive. Team Olive.
*  Anyway, yes, he's come from shaky beginnings,
*  but now has set himself up as quite the squire, shall we say.
*  I think he even uses that word.
*  And he cultivates this reputation as being slightly crazy too,
*  and used that to his political advantage.
*  He's elected senator from Tennessee, once it's a state.
*  And then runs for president, loses in 1824 and wins in 1828,
*  becoming the first US president.
*  He's not born west of the Appalachians,
*  but he represents Tennessee.
*  He's the first to be elected president
*  from west of the Appalachian Mountains.
*  He doesn't like the native tribes at all.
*  He uses the word savage very liberally, doesn't he?
*  That's right.
*  He's also, we didn't even mention his military career
*  after the revolution.
*  He's a military man as well.
*  He's a general and he fights alongside.
*  He fights with Cherokee allies.
*  He fights with Muskogee Creek allies.
*  But never from that does he gain any belief
*  that native nations should exist as nations.
*  He completely believes that their land should
*  be part of the United States.
*  Yeah, so he's fighting shoulder to shoulder with Cherokee.
*  And then he's got his eye coveting their land
*  the whole time, and the Muskogee as well.
*  Right, so that's all during the War of 1812.
*  But immediately afterwards, he's down in Muskogee country
*  trying to get their land.
*  And when you say trying to get their land,
*  with sort of tiny militia armies who
*  that are forcing people off the land
*  or forcing them to sign things over, how?
*  Yeah, so he's operating with sort of on the edge of US law.
*  So it's not quite like that, though there's always
*  the threat of military violence.
*  In Muskogee and Cherokee country,
*  so he's assigned to negotiate the treaty, the new treaty
*  with the Muskogee.
*  So the Muskogee Creek Nation has been divided
*  during the War of 1812.
*  So there's a treaty that's supposed
*  to be between the United States and the part of the Muskogees
*  who are fighting against the United States.
*  In the treaty language, though, he
*  gets the Muskogees to sign away a huge swath of land that
*  actually is clearly in the Cherokee Nation.
*  And the Cherokees were allies of the United States in the war.
*  So basically, it's like giving away your next door
*  neighbor's house.
*  Right, right.
*  So those next door neighbors, the Cherokee leaders go,
*  those Cherokees send diplomats up to Washington, DC
*  to point out that surely this has been a mistake
*  in the language of this territory
*  to include Cherokee land.
*  And actually, the president does concede, yeah,
*  that doesn't seem right.
*  And then they sort of rewrite, basically rewrite the treaty.
*  And then Jackson starts trying other methods.
*  He goes around and tries to get individual Cherokees
*  to sign a treaty giving that land to the United States.
*  And that gets called foul on that.
*  Again, with Native Americans in Florida,
*  he's even more just sort of just bald violence against them
*  because they're living in Spanish territory.
*  And so he gets himself involved in warfare
*  with both Native nations and the Spanish in Florida
*  that the United States is not at war with.
*  But he ends up getting territory for the United States
*  out of that illegally.
*  And all that is before he's elected president.
*  I was just going to say, that's with limited power.
*  Right.
*  So when he is elected president, what's
*  the year he's elected as president?
*  He's elected 1828.
*  It takes him but two years to pass
*  one of the most controversial pieces of American legislation
*  in the history of America.
*  And that would be the 1830 Indian Removal Act.
*  Three words that are such simple words,
*  and an ocean of blood is unleashed.
*  Tell us first of all, what does the Indian Removal Act
*  want to do?
*  One of the things that's important to realize
*  is that through colonial histories, British
*  and other colonial powers history and early United
*  States history, it's always assumed
*  that Native nations, Native tribes are sovereign.
*  And that if you want to make any agreement with them,
*  it is a treaty because that's what
*  you do with another nation.
*  And so even in the Indian Removal Act,
*  there is the provision that the United States needs
*  to make treaties with Native nations to remove them.
*  But what the Indian Removal Act says
*  is that the federal government, the US government
*  will make every effort possible to move any Native nations that
*  are east of the Mississippi, west of the Mississippi.
*  When you say remove, what does that mean?
*  Is that what we would call ethnic cleansing?
*  Right.
*  Yeah, it is.
*  I mean, within that law, it says they
*  have to agree to a treaty to do it.
*  So to put it in that sort of the neutral language of the law,
*  it would be the Cherokee Nation will agree to take all
*  of their people and move somewhere else.
*  So evacuate their homeland and get an equal amount of land
*  somewhere else.
*  In reality, it's not nearly that clean.
*  No Native nation agrees in any sort of non-coerced way
*  and in most cases, violent way.
*  And then they are the people.
*  Even if their leaders have signed a treaty,
*  the people of these nations haven't agreed.
*  But also the Cherokee Nation, let's
*  talk about the Cherokee Nation for a minute,
*  because they are also a sophisticated group of people.
*  They've developed a judicial system.
*  They have a two-house legislature,
*  which is exactly what the Americans have,
*  led by a man called John Ross.
*  I mean, tell us about John Ross.
*  I mean, he sounds like a character from Dallas
*  from yesteryear.
*  So he's not just Cherokee, because you
*  don't get a name like John Ross, which
*  is a very good Scottish name, from being just Cherokee.
*  What's his story?
*  There have been lots of Scottish traders
*  who have been in Cherokee country
*  in other parts of the Southeast for a while.
*  So there are a lot of last names that
*  are Scottish in that region.
*  But he's also fully Cherokee.
*  So the Cherokees are matrilineal.
*  So there's a regeneration of these men
*  who have some British, usually Scottish, ancestry,
*  but also have not only Cherokee ancestry,
*  but have Cherokee clans that they've
*  inherited through their mother.
*  They speak Cherokee themselves.
*  And they have Cherokee names, as well as their British names.
*  This is so interesting, because a direct contemporary of his,
*  we're talking now with the mid-1820s,
*  at this point in India is James Skinner,
*  who is a Rajput mother, but a Scottish mercenary father.
*  And he's caught in exactly the same bind.
*  He says that his ethnicity was like a two-edged sword made
*  both ways to cut against me.
*  But Skinner goes British, whereas he
*  starts off Maratha there.
*  Yeah, but this guy stays Cherokee beginning, middle,
*  and end.
*  He doesn't waver.
*  But it's the same dilemma, in a sense.
*  Sure, sure, sure, sure.
*  Yeah, right.
*  And John Ross fully believes that the Cherokee nation
*  is a modern nation.
*  It's a 19th century nation that you don't stop being Cherokee
*  by having a judicial system, for example.
*  It's just continuing to be Cherokee.
*  And in fact, that many of these things are put in place,
*  both because people like John Ross think
*  they're the right thing to do for a modern government
*  and because they help with the effort, the Cherokee effort,
*  to get the United States to recognize them as a nation
*  and a neighboring nation, not somebody to be subsumed
*  in the United States.
*  I'm looking at a picture of him just now.
*  And he has very much that mixed ethnicity in his face.
*  But his clothes are very Western.
*  He's wearing a bow tie.
*  He's wearing a cravat and a kind of nice high collar.
*  He's looking very smart in this picture.
*  Right, and that picture was probably
*  made in Washington, D.C. when he was on a diplomatic mission
*  to the United States and would wear those clothes.
*  He is well-educated in both English, U.S. ways
*  and in Cherokee ways.
*  That's so interesting.
*  So how many people like John Ross are there
*  with mixed ethnicity who are able to go backwards
*  and forwards and who are living in both worlds?
*  And who are fighting for the native nations as well?
*  Yeah, so within the Cherokees,
*  there's a whole generation of these young people,
*  some of whom are educated in,
*  they leave the Cherokee Nation to be educated
*  in the United States and then go back home
*  to be leaders who can be diplomat,
*  who can work between both worlds on purpose.
*  As Anita says, for the purposes of the Cherokee Nation.
*  Most Cherokees are not like that at this point, right?
*  It's still just a small group of people
*  compared to the bulk of the Cherokee population.
*  Another parallel to him would be Bolivar, presumably,
*  who is roughly this period and who is also mixed race.
*  And clearly, tries to work for his own nation,
*  his own people and multiple people.
*  And in his case succeeds.
*  He gets rid of this backlash.
*  In John Ross, you've got somebody who is educated enough,
*  loyal enough and motivated enough to call
*  and forgive the French, but bullshit.
*  When Andrew Jackson starts saying,
*  look, this removal is an act of benevolence.
*  And I think one of the phrases is,
*  surrounded by the whites with their arts of civilization,
*  which by destroying the resources of the savage,
*  doom him to weakness and decay,
*  humanity and national honor demand
*  that every effort should be made
*  to avert so great a calamity.
*  We are here to avert your calamity.
*  We are taking your house and burning your shed
*  and chasing your dog into the forest
*  to avoid your calamity.
*  And John Ross is exactly the kind of person
*  who's well-read enough and well-versed enough
*  to fighting in court to say, no, I'm sorry, what?
*  And that's exactly right.
*  They found the newspaper, the Cherokee Phoenix,
*  to make this point over and over.
*  One of the editorials in the Cherokee Phoenix says,
*  I don't know of a single Cherokee family
*  that makes its living from hunting.
*  Because one of these arguments is,
*  like, you can't hunt anymore, right?
*  Yeah, what century are you living in?
*  We're in the 19th century.
*  So tell me, who's reading the Cherokee Phoenix?
*  Is there a whole urban population of literate Cherokees
*  that's sitting there, you know,
*  going out to the newsagent on a Friday night?
*  I mean, yes, kind of so.
*  So the Cherokee Phoenix is printed in English
*  and in the Cherokee syllabary.
*  So by this point in the very early 19th century,
*  a Cherokee man named Sequoia and his daughter invent a,
*  it's basically an alphabet.
*  It's called a syllabary
*  because each character stands for a syllable.
*  It represents a syllable rather than just one sound,
*  but it's like an alphabet.
*  And they can then write down the Cherokee language
*  in syllable, like, they can write the Cherokee language.
*  It's very well-designed, and apparently,
*  they say very easy for somebody who already speaks Cherokee
*  to learn to use.
*  And so by this point, by the 1830s,
*  the literacy rate in the Cherokee nation is over 90%.
*  Over 90% of Cherokees can read Cherokee,
*  which is much higher than the literacy rate
*  in the US population at this point.
*  Are there any American readers of the Cherokee Phoenix
*  who would say, you know, you're right?
*  Yeah, and so the English language,
*  the parts of the Cherokee Phoenix
*  that are written in English
*  are mostly directed at those readers,
*  at white American leaders and reformers
*  and all kinds of people who are against Indian removal.
*  So the Indian removal act,
*  we would talk about how it's controversial,
*  including it is controversial at the time.
*  It does not pass easily through the US Congress.
*  There are many elected officials who are against it.
*  There are some prominent US senators
*  who speak on the floor of the US Senate against it
*  as a travesty, and, you know,
*  point out the hypocrisy we've been talking about
*  in Indian removal.
*  And so I think it's easy to imagine
*  Native American history as being the loss
*  as being inevitable,
*  but the Cherokees, Cherokee leaders at the time
*  really believe that there are these efforts
*  they're doing in the US courts
*  for US public opinion that may change the tide.
*  They are for one thing really hoping
*  that Andrew Jackson loses his reelection bid,
*  which is totally possible.
*  You know, anybody can win an election.
*  He's running against Henry Clay.
*  Cherokees really hope Henry Clay will win
*  and will shift policy back away from Indian removal.
*  So it's really up in the air.
*  It could go either way, but it goes Jackson's way.
*  It doesn't go their way.
*  Andrew Jackson is again reinstalled in the White House.
*  And so now the Trail of Tears begins,
*  which is this rather poetic term
*  that's given to something that is an utter disaster,
*  and in many cases a death march.
*  Could you talk us through what happens?
*  I mean, I sort of said an ocean of blood,
*  and it is a lot of people.
*  Talk us through this.
*  So the Cherokees actually win a US Supreme Court case.
*  The US Supreme Court says the laws of Georgia
*  have no force in the Cherokee Nation,
*  recognizes at least some sovereignty
*  by the Cherokee Nation,
*  but Jackson ignores the US Supreme Court ruling,
*  goes ahead with sending the military in to the Cherokees,
*  literally rounds up Cherokee people,
*  puts them in a stockade.
*  I mean, I saw a figure of about 125,000 people.
*  It's on the scale of the Armenian death marches
*  a century later.
*  Where are they told they have to go,
*  and how long have they got to get there?
*  Yeah, so the lands that they're told they have to exchange
*  for their homeland are in what's now Oklahoma.
*  It's west of the Mississippi River.
*  It's a long way away.
*  It's more than 1,000 miles away.
*  There are various routes that they take.
*  Some go at least part of the way by river.
*  Much of it is walking, though.
*  With whatever they can carry
*  and whatever they can get on carts.
*  That's right.
*  So they have to leave, you know,
*  they leave not only their land property behind,
*  the property that they can't take with them,
*  they leave behind.
*  They pile what they can into wagons.
*  Now I should say some Cherokees at this point
*  own human beings, are slaveholders.
*  They take that human property with them.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  So in a travesty upon a travesty,
*  they're enslaved people who are forced
*  on the Trail of Tears.
*  But as late as the 1840s,
*  I don't know why I thought that wouldn't be happening.
*  Right, right, until the Civil War, through the Civil War.
*  Right, right.
*  And still it's a minority of Cherokee people
*  who own slaves, but they do.
*  It's still pretty, can I just have a moment to go, bleh?
*  Okay, but bleh.
*  I mean, on figures, the things that I've been looking at,
*  125,000 people.
*  That's how many live east of the Mississippi,
*  but by the 1840s, there are only 30,000.
*  What is the mechanism by which those that do remain remain?
*  Is it just that the officials don't get around
*  to moving them or have they negotiated
*  their right to remain intermarried?
*  Do reservations exist?
*  Yeah, they do, they do.
*  Their reservations exist from the 1600s in Virginia.
*  So reservations are very early in some places.
*  And so there are large numbers,
*  not relative to those who are forced to move,
*  but there are large numbers of Native people
*  who remain in the east.
*  And they do so by a variety of measures.
*  So some have managed to get individual land ownership title.
*  So state courts have to recognize.
*  So for example, the Catawbas of South Carolina,
*  they get their, what is actually communal national land,
*  put in the names of individuals.
*  And so the South Carolina courts just can't kick those
*  people off that land because they have it in land title.
*  That would, it would throw everybody's land title.
*  But three quarters are kicked out.
*  Yeah, so relatively not that many.
*  And then so there's a group of Cherokees,
*  the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians.
*  They stay in Western North Carolina.
*  They are able to put some land title in some of their names,
*  but also in some of the names of some white neighbors.
*  And then there are also ways of just sort of hiding,
*  as you suggested, there are ancestors of the Lumbees,
*  for example, in North Carolina, right near the coast.
*  They just, they're Native communities that are settled,
*  that sort of retreat to swampy land,
*  land that isn't useful for plantations
*  and just kind of hide out there.
*  I mean, their white neighbors know they're there,
*  but they don't seem threatening and they aren't on land
*  that white populations particularly want.
*  But Kathleen, these are horrific numbers
*  and horrific stories.
*  Can you call it a genocide?
*  Yes, I think so.
*  I mean, there are lots of debates about when and whether
*  to use the word genocide,
*  but the era of Indian removal seems very clear.
*  It is a purposeful effort by the United States
*  to get rid of them.
*  It's certainly ethnic cleansing to separate
*  the sort of white population from the Native population.
*  And many, many, you know, thousands of people
*  die on the way west.
*  Yeah, it's a genocide.
*  Is it the Andrew Jackson portrait that hung
*  in the White House in the Trump presidency?
*  Is that what kicked up a storm?
*  Am I remembering that right?
*  That's exactly right, right, right.
*  Yeah, it's not there right now.
*  Yeah, yeah, Jackson's a very controversial figure
*  in the United States, as he was in his own day.
*  The legacy of this is something that Claudio Sont
*  looks at in his book, Unworthy Republic.
*  And I just read this.
*  He says, the US sponsored expulsion
*  of the Russian officers in the Caucasus in the 1840s.
*  Circassians are just like your American Indians,
*  the regional governor reportedly told one American visitor
*  shortly before Russia deported half a million people.
*  Towards the end of the century, German imperialists
*  in Southwest Africa looked to the United States
*  as an example of how to expel local residents
*  in the name of progress,
*  a goal that was widely shared by European administrators
*  who coveted the African continent's vast resources.
*  Notoriously, during the Nazi conquest of Eastern Europe,
*  Hitler equated, quote, indigenous inhabitants
*  with, quote, Indians, and declared that the Volga
*  must be our Mississippi.
*  Good God.
*  Our Mississippi, wow.
*  So those are three horrific examples
*  of those who learn genocide and ethnic cleansing
*  from Andrew Jackson's United States.
*  Look, I mean, pleasure's not the right word,
*  but it's been illuminating.
*  Kathleen, thank you so much for holding our hands
*  and taking us through this.
*  Kathleen Duvall's excellent,
*  and I really mean excellent, eye-opening book
*  is called Native Nations, A Millennium in North America.
*  Brand new also, is it?
*  Brand spanking new.
*  I've got the big hard back.
*  It's very shiny.
*  Beautifully written, Kathleen.
*  We should say also accessible
*  for anyone that wants a single volume on this.
*  It's highly, highly accessible
*  and totally recommended by both Anita and I.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  Look, next week, the baton is passed
*  from east to west of the Mississippi,
*  where these Indian nations,
*  these tribes are meant to have a life of peace and security,
*  according to the treaties that they have been signing
*  or forced to sign.
*  Is this a happily ever after?
*  Sadly not.
*  It might not be.
*  Join us when we talk to Katie Hickman
*  about some really extraordinary stories.
*  Anyway, till the next time we meet,
*  it's goodbye from me and Anita Arnett.
*  Goodbye from me, William Durham.
