# The Birth of Saudi Arabia
**Empire Podcast:** [September 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krqFFrLAZqk)
*  Hello and welcome to Empire with me, Anita Arnand.
*  And me, William Durranpour.
*  Are you this very casual today because you're on the beach?
*  I'm recording in Goa.
*  So there's no reason to be up in the morning or to rush at giving my name.
*  You're actually quite modestly dressed today compared to the chat I had with you yesterday
*  on Zoom, which frankly needed a rating like a cinema rating.
*  I'm very glad that no one can watch either of these.
*  It was Dalrymple Beach ready.
*  Just let your mind wander with that as it will.
*  Just saying, plunging V-necks.
*  Plunging V-necks, people.
*  That's what was going on in Goa.
*  I'm very excited you prepared it so memorable.
*  I'm just scared in my retina forever.
*  Anyway, what a perfect way to start a program on what happens.
*  It's contrast.
*  Life is full of contrast, darling.
*  That's what we're saying.
*  Anyway, look, over the last few weeks, we've explained many of the most important historical
*  events that have shaped the Middle East as we know it today.
*  Things like Sykes-Picot, the Balfour Declaration.
*  Today, we're going to be rounding off that story with one further historical event from
*  the early 20th century, which involves many of the characters you've met before on this podcast.
*  We're talking about the rise of Saudi Arabia.
*  The guest we have on to talk to us about this is my old friend, Steve Coll, who is now in London,
*  I'm very pleased to say.
*  We'll get to see more of him.
*  Normally, he's stuck in the New Yorker office in New York or running think tanks in Washington
*  or generally doing Pulitzer Prizes wherever he is.
*  The reason we've particularly got Steve on is his extraordinary book on the Bin Laden's written,
*  obviously, in the aftermath of 9-11, which is the best introduction I've read to not just the Bin
*  Laden family, but also to the wider world of the early story of Saudi Arabia, the rise of Ibn Saud,
*  the extraordinary discovery of oil and all that happens in Saudi Arabia to turn it from
*  one of the least important parts of the Islamic world on the edge of things to very much the
*  center and the richest place in Islam, controlling the oil of the world and hugely altering the form
*  of Islam globally.
*  These are all subjects which Steve has written about brilliantly.
*  He has won, not one, but sickeningly two Pulitzer Prizes.
*  I'm happy for you, Steve.
*  I am genuinely happy for you.
*  Don't worry.
*  Two Pulitzer Prizes.
*  It's outrageous, outrageous hogging them.
*  I was so thrilled when William said that you would come on to the podcast.
*  I think I did actually say, what the Steve Coll in case you had some knockoff pound shop Steve
*  Coll, obviously.
*  No other Steve Coll, the unfamous Steve Coll.
*  He never won any Pulitzers at all.
*  No, no.
*  It's the – well, listen, welcome.
*  Welcome to our rambling introduction of a podcast here.
*  We should really start with one man.
*  I think this is always a really good way into a subject.
*  People may think that they know what Wahhabism is in the modern political context, but you can't
*  really understand what Wahhabism is until you understand Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud.
*  Can we start with very, very bare basics?
*  Who was he and what was he like?
*  Well, he was a tall, charismatic figure in a tribal society, very impoverished, but formidable
*  in his own right.
*  He's about six feet three, which in his day was a giant.
*  He led a band of followers who belonged to the Saud enlarged family or clan.
*  They had ruled central Arabia, the Arabian Peninsula in a mud-walled fortress in Riyadh
*  twice in the previous centuries during the Ottoman period, but they had lost power and
*  were in exile in Kuwait and plotting a return.
*  He was a formidable sort of battle leader, but in thinking about battles in Arabia in the late 19th
*  century, early 20th century, you kind of have to picture a bunch of malnourished men toting rifles
*  and swords, charging into one another's encampments, screaming very loudly, slashing around and trying
*  to chase their enemies away.
*  And he was very good at that.
*  He bore the scars on his legs and body of more than one kind of slashing sword fight that he
*  had prevailed in or at least survived.
*  And that was his life.
*  So in 1902 in Kuwait, he organized a march on Riyadh, which was a formidable march, a great
*  distance across desert tracks with only a few oases to stop at.
*  And when he got to the walls of his ancestral kingdom, as it were, not much to look at, but
*  meaningful to him and his followers nonetheless, he succeeded in chasing away the tribe that
*  occupied Riyadh.
*  And he declared the rebirth of Saudi Arabia, literally the Arabia that belongs to the South.
*  And that was not the first time the peninsula had been Saudi Arabia, but it was the birth
*  of modern Saudi Arabia.
*  Steve, we've had in two episodes lately, our episode on Lawrence of Arabia and the episode
*  on Sykes-Picot, we've heard a lot about the Sharif of Mecca.
*  Hussein, what's the relationship of Ibn Saud to the Sharif of Mecca?
*  They were enemies, essentially.
*  I mean, he regarded the Sharif as illegitimate, a puppet of Britain.
*  And he was suspicious.
*  In what sense?
*  Because he was obviously the descendant of the Prophet and the senior most descendant.
*  Well, in the Wahhabi reading of history, meaning the tradition of Islam and the political power
*  that Ibn Saud saw himself representing, the Sharifs were not entitled to rule Mecca and
*  Medina, that their control of the holy cities had been wrested illegitimately from the Sauds.
*  And this leads us on to the ideological difference between the two men.
*  Tell us what Wahhabism is and who Ibn Wahhab was.
*  So Ibn Wahhab was a preacher of the 18th century who interpreted Islam to require its followers
*  to live as the Prophet did during his lifetime.
*  And that meant rejecting all technology that was not available then.
*  So, I mean, to us in a modern day context, Wahhabism is about austerity in many ways.
*  You know, austerity of dress, of lifestyle, shunning, alcohol, any inebriant at all.
*  It's of veils and shrouds.
*  I mean, that's what it means to many people in the West.
*  But this was not a man who lived in veils and shrouds himself, is he?
*  I mean, you know, just tell us a little bit about his...
*  You're laughing and I could laugh too because I also know what's coming.
*  How did this man live his life?
*  Well, he said that he had three great pleasures in life.
*  Women, perfume and prayer.
*  So at least prayer was one of the three.
*  Okay, that takes the box.
*  I could go for two of the three.
*  Okay.
*  But how did he square that circle?
*  I mean, how does that work?
*  Through interpretation, as all people who make exceptions to doctrine do, I suppose.
*  He interpreted Islam's permission to marry four times as a license to marry serially
*  and to divorce rapidly.
*  So he described himself as the married husband of 135 virgins and 100 other women during his lifetime.
*  And then he also had concupines and slaves beyond that.
*  So this is a very particular form of piracy.
*  Yes.
*  And, you know, okay, some of those marriages were political marriages associated with
*  conquests of various OASIs.
*  But essentially, that was the way he organized his life was around these serial marriages
*  and the sexual activity that he could pursue.
*  Steve, just quickly go back again to Ibn Wahhab and Wahhabism,
*  because I think it's very important here.
*  Just again, if we could just explore the theological aspects of Wahhabism.
*  I'm based in India.
*  Many of our listeners are in India and they're very familiar here,
*  as in many other parts of the Islamic world, with Sufism, with visiting shrines,
*  with a sort of syncretic Islam that blends in with
*  Coptic Christianity in Egypt, with Hinduism in India.
*  What was so different about Wahhabism?
*  Well, first, to start with your mention of aesthetics,
*  Wahhabism was austere to the point of nullification.
*  So no adornment, no shrines, no celebration of any intermediary between God and man.
*  So saints, of course, were anathema to Wahhabism.
*  And this was expressed in architecture, but also in ritual,
*  and in expectations of the way a faithful Muslim lived from day to day.
*  It wasn't just an austerity that attempted to imitate conditions during the prophet's lifetime,
*  but it was also an expectation that one would live a kind of interior faith,
*  away from the world and from politics.
*  Again, my life is in Delhi, and we have our own sort of indigenous strain of Wahhabism,
*  which emerged from the hajjahs at the same time with Amankusha Waliyullah,
*  who is thought to have studied in the hajjahs at the same time as Ibn Wahhab,
*  who then came back to Delhi and was advocating very much the same approach to Islam,
*  very suspicious of Sufi shrines, wanting to pull out anything that was remotely Hindu
*  or anything that was considered to be un-Islamic in the syncretic Islam of the time.
*  And he goes on to found the madrasa, which in turn gives birth to dayuband.
*  And so you get these two forms of a very similar austere, puritanical Islam,
*  both of which will culminate in the stories that we're about to tell
*  in the second half that leads us to the bin Laden's and 9-11.
*  From both of you, I'd love your insight into this because it doesn't sound like fun.
*  I mean, just to put it very mildly, it does not sound like a fun way to live.
*  There are some aspects that sound quite fun.
*  Well, I mean, the thing is, when you look at the Western canon, you have puritanism leaps up out
*  of an objection to the excesses of Catholicism and the oppression that Catholicism is deemed
*  to have brought on the people who have the least. And they get to this point where they've had
*  enough and you have somebody nail something up on a church door.
*  Was that the same with Wahhabism and the dayubandis as you've described them,
*  that they are reacting against something and that is what the popularity is based on?
*  I mean, there wasn't anything quite as extravagant as the Catholic Church to
*  have a revival and overthrow. But yes, I mean, certainly the prevalence of saints, shrines,
*  the commercial exploitation of pilgrims and the building of businesses around
*  saints and in kind of inventing Islam for commercial purposes, that was something that they
*  reviled and revolted against in a way that might be parallel to Protestant Reformation.
*  And the clerics dealt with his excesses of Abdulaziz, Ibn Saud, I mean, how? Because,
*  I mean, you mentioned the perfume, but we've missed out one beautiful little detail, which
*  is in your book, which is just tell us a little bit about the vial of perfume, Steve, because I
*  find that completely compelling. Well, he used to keep it in the pocket of his robes and rub it on
*  his hands from hour to hour. And whenever he greeted visitors, he would douse himself and
*  douse them perhaps to their astonishment. The man may be gone, but the scent remains.
*  It's like a calling card. It's still a big deal, isn't it?
*  Saudi Arabia today, if you go there, the Ittar is something which is there even in sort of airports,
*  you see Ittar shops and it's put on you and it's very hard to avoid.
*  Well, I mean, in the era before the ubiquitous shower, we should all be grateful for the ubiquitous.
*  Yes, true, true. Yes, small mercies and tiny vials, I understand with you now. But tell me,
*  I mean, the clerics who adhered to, I suppose, the letter of Wahhabism, did they not tell him,
*  look, this is lovely that you're representing Wahhabism, but maybe do it a bit more and carry
*  it out a bit more? Well, this is critical to your question about it doesn't sound like much fun.
*  Of course, politically powerful rulers in Saudi Arabia continually interpreted Islam to suit their
*  lifestyles or lived privately and had their clerics endorse their own decisions while preaching a more
*  austere set of requirements to the public. Both Dio-Bond Islam and Wahhabism generated clerical
*  influence and rule, not direct rule like you would see in revolutionary Iran today, but
*  influence. And yet they had to share power with the men with the guns, the men who ruled the palaces,
*  and ultimately their preferences prevailed. And because it was a rulemaking, interpretive austerity,
*  you could write the rules to accommodate whatever the boss wanted. And in the case of Ibn Saud,
*  what he wanted was some technology that Wahhabism strictly interpreted might not permit. So he had
*  automobiles and he became obsessed with the radio. And it took a while to persuade the clerics that
*  these radio broadcasts were not the devil. And there was a particular problem involving
*  the news broadcasts that he liked to listen to from the BBC because they were preceded by
*  that jingle music that we all find so, I don't know, aggravating, inspiring.
*  Watch your step, love.
*  You're gonna BBC girl here.
*  Watch your step, is what I'm saying.
*  So you know we're gonna agree. Trust me.
*  Originally the clerics said you can't listen to any of this radio because the devil is inside
*  playing this music. And they eventually had to persuade them that it was a mechanical problem,
*  that that was not an expression of the devil's will on earth.
*  Oh, interesting. How interesting. How interesting. So look, you've got this man who has created
*  an autonomy which people will tolerate his excesses, but he can tell everyone what to do
*  and people are doing what he wants them to do. He has gone, he's reclaimed his ancestral lands,
*  ridden into Riyadh, taken it back. The First World War though sort of marks a new phase for him,
*  doesn't it? And it's defined on relations with Britain. Tell us a bit more about that.
*  Yeah, this is fascinating because we've been, this is very much the background of the last few
*  pods and as I say, we've been following the Sharif of Mecca, Hussein,
*  very closely. So weave us through that.
*  Well, so the context is the competition between the British and Ottoman empires as the World
*  First World War approaches, then as it's fought and then in its aftermath. And the Ottomans are
*  obviously the losers and the British are ascendant. But one question the British have for themselves
*  in Arabia is what do we really want? I mean, this is pre-oil. They had subsidized Ibn Saud in
*  Riyadh and other rulers in the interior of Arabia and they had occasionally sent
*  adventurous official delegations across the peninsula to meet and entreat and explain
*  Britain to these isolated peoples, but they hadn't sought to govern. And now there was still
*  a reluctance on their part to get involved in the center of Arabia. There was nothing there but sand
*  and not enough water, but they wanted influence. And one of the problems they faced with Ibn Saud
*  was that he didn't trust the British because of their support for the Sharif in the Hejaz.
*  And in fact, he was planning hostilities against Britain's client in the Hejaz. So
*  they had a complicated relationship.
*  What age is he? I'm trying to sort of picture him. You know, if you've got the Sharif in one corner
*  and you've got him in the other, I mean, how do they compare with age experience?
*  Ibn Saud was still kind of in his prime physically in the 1920s. He was in his 30s, I think, maybe
*  his 40s, but he was still robust and still active on the battlefield. He loved to hunt,
*  which he did in his imported Ford automobiles. He would drive around and shoot at gazelles from
*  the back of his car, but he also still marched and rode camels into battle.
*  And to answer your question, Anita, I just checked with the model in here,
*  and 1854 is the birthday of the Sharif. So he's a full 50 years older, the Sharif.
*  So Ibn Saud is very much two generations down.
*  Yeah. Yeah. So that adds another sort of layer to the whole thing.
*  In British documents, do they have their accounts, their first accounts of what they thought he was
*  like?
*  Yeah. I mean, their emissaries would typically start in the Persian Gulf protectorates, so Kuwait,
*  Bahrain, and their British diplomats and legations were well established, and they were responsible
*  for keeping track of what was happening in central remote Arabia. And to do that every now and then,
*  a party would be assembled and they would walk from Bahrain or Kuwait to Riyadh and then onward,
*  usually all the way across to the Red Sea. So when those accounts are available,
*  and they're quite wonderful, they're usually full of detail. And of course, half of these diplomats
*  saw themselves as geographers on the side, so they're recording all kinds of obscure details
*  about flora and fauna.
*  Flux of partridges.
*  Yes. And then they record their dinners and the conversation and the rituals,
*  which they were fascinated to record about what would be expected of a visitor, how a visitor was
*  received and who in the court was responsible for what. This was political intelligence, so
*  if there were follow-up efforts to influence the king, they would know how to go about
*  buying off courtiers, that sort of thing. So they're wonderful accounts, and they occurred
*  at intervals. But nobody went through Riyadh in those days and said, you know what, we ought
*  to stay here and build out our empire. They moved on pretty quickly.
*  And that's because he didn't, in the time since he took Riyadh, did he not make many changes to it?
*  Did it remain the kind of rudimentary settlements that it was when he rode in on his camels and
*  shot the governor?
*  He needed gold. And until oil came along, he didn't really have a lot of gold. The British
*  subsidies were one source, but he did start building outside the walls of the original
*  palace, but it was slow going until oil came along.
*  And the real sort of centre of merchants and culture in that region was always Jeddah,
*  wasn't it? That's where the architecture, the links with India and the wider sort of Red Sea
*  world is centred.
*  Absolutely. I mean, Jeddah was a global city. It was the port of entry for the pilgrimages and
*  for global Islam. Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims passed through Jeddah in the course
*  of a year or two, and they came from all over the world. Many stayed and built businesses.
*  And Jeddah was one of the most gloriously diverse cities in the world.
*  And so and the Hajas in general had benefited from its international links for centuries,
*  and it was defined by its diversity in many ways.
*  It sounds to me as if he's very much on the periphery of all of the action and the empire
*  building and shredding that we've been talking about in this series. But then he does enter
*  into a deal with the British, who it does sound as if they completely underestimate him and just
*  throw him a bone, if you like, just to keep him onside. And what is the nature of the deal
*  that he does with the British?
*  And who does he do the deal with, very crucially?
*  Well, yes, let's start with the dealmaker. I mean, it's Harry St John Philby, isn't it?
*  I mean, Harry St John Philby, a geographer, self-styled, took a first-class degree from
*  Cambridge and came down to Arabia, where he went into business and lived in Jeddah and built up a
*  car dealership, primarily a Ford dealership where he had exclusive rights. And he became a vital
*  sort of interpreter and interlocutor for Ibn Saud and came to understand what the king wanted.
*  The king rewarded Harry St John with a slave girl of his own.
*  But I never knew he was a car dealer.
*  Yes.
*  Can I also pause for a eww and carry on?
*  I mean, is Prince Paul the car or the slave dealer?
*  I mean, you can guess.
*  Yes. So the Ford franchise turned out to be his real ticket to influence with Ibn Saud, because
*  he plied the king with automobiles and at a discount and arranged for all of the financing and
*  and developed a role as a negotiator for the king.
*  Am I allowed to do a spoiler here, Anita?
*  No.
*  A little look forward?
*  No.
*  No.
*  Look into my eye. Honestly, Steve, I'm sorry. I'm only shouting at him because I have to.
*  No, you are the one who will shout, Butler did it in the middle of a theater. No, no.
*  Just concentrate on the word Philby, everybody.
*  We've got two Pulitzer prizes here. Steve, two Pulitzer prizes. No, no, no. OK, do carry on,
*  Steve. OK, so this month, I mean, it is funny. It just struck me that today we talk about
*  political horse trading, but it's just car dealing. It's just car dealing at this time.
*  And it's a Ford dealership.
*  I mean, 250 vehicles that this king eventually possessed.
*  That numbers the roads by about 249, doesn't it?
*  Maybe 250. But he would drive them in on sort of hard scrabble desert to hunt gazelles. And then
*  he would, of course, abuse them, misuse them and then just leave them to rust in the desert. So
*  he didn't use them. He didn't park them back into the garage and have them polished up for
*  his next outing. He would just use them for a single hunt and then abandon them.
*  So all that stuff that goes on when you go to Egypt or to Saudi Arabia or Dubai, where they
*  take you rolling on four wheel drives over Sanjeev, that begins with a thousand of them.
*  Exactly, exactly.
*  Right. OK, so we've got the name Philby. Well done for your restraint.
*  You've hardly flagged it or passed a brass band by it at all. It's going to be a huge
*  shocker when he comes out. No one will see it coming. But OK, so he's living the fast life
*  quite literally in his Ford automobiles. What are his political ambitions at this time?
*  Well, he wants to conquer the Hejaz, is the most important of them. That is his overriding ambition.
*  It is the greatest source of wealth in pre-oil Arabia by orders of magnitude. Three million
*  British pounds, 1920s pounds in direct tax revenue and then an economy worth many millions more.
*  When you're sitting in a mud palace that you want to rebuild and you have 100 wives and you want 100
*  more and you want all the cent required to greet all your visitors, you can't live on the income
*  available in Riyadh at that time. The Hejaz beckons and it's a place that his family had ruled before
*  and it is also an ambition endorsed by his clerics because he believes that it is righteous for
*  the Wahhabs and the Sauds to rule the two holiest places in Islam. So he musters a campaign to invade
*  the Hejaz. So what has happened to the Hussein dynasty, the Sharif of Mecca?
*  Because we last saw them really with Lawrence of Arabia with all the children getting sort of
*  kingdoms parceled out in Iraq and Transjordan. What's happened since then?
*  They've weakened to the point of complete evisceration and they've lost their connections to
*  the Ottoman Empire is no more. The sort of whole system that they presided over has crumbled.
*  Britain is there to support them but is hedging about the future of the Hejaz. This is the critical
*  thing. Their old sponsors are gone and their new sponsors are ambivalent. So when Ibn Saud
*  marches out towards Taif and then eventually Mecca, Medina and Jeddah, the British don't go
*  into action to back up the Hashemites. And so that actually makes this campaign a rather simple one
*  for Ibn Saud. And is it a surprise that the British to sit back and let this happen? Are they in secret
*  negotiations with Ibn Saud or have they fallen out very publicly with the Hashemites?
*  They've built up relations with Ibn Saud. They've done some side deals with him. They're subsidizing
*  him. They see him as a man of the future. They think he's probably, inevitably, the superior
*  military power and that if he's determined to conquer the Hejaz, it might be better to deal with
*  him than not. Their larger anxieties are the future of the Hashemite family but Germany and
*  other imperial encroachments as the Ottoman Empire dissolves. And if Ibn Saud is their man and nobody
*  else has access to him, maybe better to bet on the future through him. And then the way he sort
*  of takes and holds land, I mean, this is really interesting, the Ikhwan. Have I said that right?
*  Is that the correct pronunciation? So just describe how that system works and why it's so
*  effective for him. Well, the Ikhwan, literally brotherhood, a militia that was loyal to him
*  but also a bit of a tiger that he had to ride, independent minded, well armed, effective in battle.
*  And this was a part of the calculation. If you were a British colonial officer in Jeddah writing
*  letters home to say what should be done, you had to account for the fact that nobody could really
*  defeat the Ikhwan in battle if they were determined to conquer a particular city or
*  territory. And they had given Ibn Saud control over other less significant parts of Central Arabia,
*  Oasis and minor kingdoms. And now they shared his ambition to conquer Mecca and Medina. They too
*  were fired by a sense of religious zeal, righteousness and ambition and thought that they
*  should rule the streets of Mecca and Medina and enforce the precepts of Wahhabism that were so
*  blatantly flouted by the behavior of pilgrims in those days.
*  And it's very difficult for the British to get their heads around this or anybody because you
*  cannot buy off religious people. Because if they believe that they have a religious mission,
*  it isn't as if you can sort of inveigle your way and promise them riches or a minor kingdom
*  because there is something bigger. There is something bigger at play here.
*  That's it. And also, the Ikhwan were particularly fierce and independent in their thinking. Even
*  Ibn Saud was nervous about them and had trouble managing them. If you came in all of your colonial
*  finery to meet with their leadership, you would have the reception that many European diplomats
*  today have when they try to visit with the Taliban's leadership in Kandahar and explain
*  to them why they should change their ways. It is not diplomacy as typically practiced by
*  the colonial office in those days. So what happened, Steve, when they take
*  Mecca? Describe the arrival of the Saudis for the first time into Mecca with their Ikhwan warriors.
*  Well, imagine them dressed in their austere uniformed robes, waving black and white flags,
*  black robes and waving black and white flags.
*  Modelled on the followers of the Prophet, is that the idea?
*  Yes. And I think, you know, just again, expressing through their aesthetic choices,
*  the primacy of the word of God and the absence of intermediaries between the life of the Prophet
*  as recorded in the Quran and the Hadiths and their role on earth. And at the point of a sword,
*  literally, to come in and to clean out anyone who opposes them in the name of this cause.
*  And so they were not militarily opposed as they filtered into Mecca and Medina. They just arrived
*  as this kind of tide of zealous militia, police, who established checkpoints in control and got
*  to work at dismantling all that they encountered that violated their sense.
*  Are we thinking, you know, like the Lawrence of Arabia film, are they literally coming on camels
*  and horses or are they all got Fords now? What are we talking about?
*  On foot, on camel, on horses, but not in possession of a lot of Fords. That was the King's garage.
*  They didn't have access to the keys.
*  And so they come in and what do they do to the shrines that they regard as idolatrous?
*  They destroy them. They destroy them vigorously and quickly.
*  Is there no resistance to that by pious locals?
*  I'm not aware of a recorded organized resistance. I'm sure there were people who were appalled and
*  surprised and angered, but the Ikhwan broke no dissent as they go about this campaign.
*  Just to break in here and give a little bit of chronology for our listeners that may be
*  slightly at sea. So we've had an episode on the burning of Smirna. That's 1922. We then talked
*  about the last Sultan Abdul Majid, the last Ottoman who is thrown out of Istanbul and gets
*  into the Orient Express. That's 1924. This is happening 1926. So this is two years after the
*  Ataturk has launched the Turkish Republic. This whole Ottoman world, the last fragments of it are
*  now disappearing and we're very much heading towards the world that we recognize today,
*  the map that's there on the Middle East now. And do you know what? It's a good place to take a break
*  because now we've got, you know, Ibn Saad has taken those religious sites. Join us after the break when
*  we find out what comes with that because if you control those places, you also control enormous
*  tax revenues that may come with it. And global Islam is at your feet.
*  Welcome back. Our very special guest star today is Steve Cole and we are talking about the rise of
*  Saudi Arabia. The fall of the Ottoman Empire gave rise to so much of the world that we recognize
*  today and our gaze now settles on Ibn Saad. And just before the break, we had Ibn Saad with his
*  Iqwan taking Mecca, Medina, smashing up the shrines that he found were idolatrous. The Iqwan are now
*  running the show there. There is money as well to be made by doing this. Just describe what follows
*  when you take a religious site like Mecca. Well, there's direct tax revenue that's always been
*  extracted from the pilgrims who arrive and from the institutions that serve them. As I mentioned,
*  I think that amounted to about three million British pounds a year at the time Ibn Saad conquered
*  the Hejaz. And then there is all sorts of business going on in Jeddah, everything from
*  the time a ship arrives off Jeddah's ports to the time a pilgrim departs. There's
*  ferry boats and hotels and transport companies and companies that provision the rituals of the
*  pilgrimage and companies that sell Zamzam water and all of them are taxable. And if you think
*  about Arabia though in those days, pre-oil, and just imagine this expanse of underpopulated desert
*  with a few oases pocketed here and there. And yes, on the far eastern shores, there's some pearl
*  diving and some fishing that people can make a decent living from. But most of Arabia is barren
*  of economy and the Hejaz is this extraordinary source of wealth. So it's transformational for
*  Ibn Saad to capture it. And you say pre-oil. So when do we start getting the beginning of prospecting?
*  How quickly does that come after Ibn Saad has seized Mecca? Well, the oil age is underway.
*  It was Winston Churchill during the First World War who sought to change the British Navy's fuel
*  from coal to oil and prospecting is happening in other parts of the world. The Anglo-Persian oil
*  company is becoming very important in Persia, isn't it? Yes. And so the 1920s is really the
*  beginning of the commercial exploitation of oil. And in Arabia, it was sort of always obvious that
*  it was there in eastern Arabia, what we now call eastern Saudi Arabia and Kuwait because it would
*  bubble up from the surface of the sea and the sand. And where there's oil, bizarrely, there's also
*  Harry Philby. Tell us. I mean, he's no idiot, is he?
*  This guy did very well. I mean, he got the exclusive Ford franchise, but more presciently,
*  he made himself the exclusive agent for SoCal, which is a part of the Rockefeller oil dynasty
*  of America, an American oil company based in California that is now coming to the Middle East
*  to join other Western oil companies in seeking access to consortia to produce and sell. And
*  he becomes their exclusive agent. He gets a monthly fee in the thousands of dollars to
*  basically guide them through Arabia. And it's probably a pretty good choice for the oil company
*  because he's the only Westerner who sits at the right hand of Ibn Saud. And Ibn Saud now controls
*  the territory where everyone knows the oil is right there just beneath the surface, if not on
*  the surface. And Philby is converted to Islam at this point. He's now become not Harry Syngin
*  Philby, but Abdullah. He has, you know, at Ibn Saud's sort of suggestion. And I think seeing
*  both the potential to expand his own fortune and his own prestige, he's a complicated character.
*  You know, he's increasingly becoming alienated from his British homeland. At the same time,
*  he wants to be recognized as the world's foremost English geographer. And one of the things that he
*  keeps asking Ibn Saud is for permission to exclusively document the flora and fauna of
*  Arabia such as it is. And then he uses these multifaceted kind of conversations with Ibn Saud
*  to introduce him to the oil age. And you know what? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
*  I'm opening the door for you. Wait for it. This is the drum roll. I wanted to get in for you.
*  And Steve, it's I mean, he's feathering quite a lovely nest. Very interesting egg is about to be
*  laid in that nest. Well, the egg is already laid. Is it 1912? The egg is laid. You mean his, his,
*  his child, his child. Go for it, Steve. This is a big moment. No indication that this is coming at
*  all. I mean, everybody throw your hands in the air in shock. Who is his child? His son, Kim Philby,
*  who follows his father to Cambridge, where he is recruited to the global cause of Soviet
*  communism and becomes the greatest and most successful traitor in modern British history.
*  Did not see that coming. But just quickly to just hang on on that for one second. Philby's,
*  you mentioned the father is already alienated from Britain in what sense? I mean, can we see
*  Kim Philby's alienation from his homeland, partly through what his father's doing at this moment?
*  I mean, it's a book someone should write. I would certainly like to read it. I think there is a
*  connection. How to describe it gets complicated involving fathers and sons generally, but,
*  you know, his father was alienated. His father was attracted to radical.
*  It's a brilliant idea for a book. Steve, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, no one is allowed to put in this book
*  proposal. But yeah, his father was alienated, not only from Britain, where he felt he just
*  didn't get his due, he'd been away from a long time. He, he was also, you know, intrigued by
*  fascism. He was intrigued by Germany and in the thirties by Hitler as Ibn Saud was, you know,
*  Philby moderated Ibn Saud's growing obsession with fascism and actually helped Britain prevent Ibn
*  Saud from defecting formally to Germany. But they were both sitting around the radio talking,
*  you know, smack, as we would say in New York about all of the European powers.
*  Yeah. And can I just say William Dower and I genuinely written down book proposal Philby on
*  a piece of paper, haven't you? I can reach you like a pamphlet. He went on to it.
*  Can I just, for the sake of the copyright recording, note who introduced the idea of the
*  book. I was thinking about it on my walk over to the office this morning and anticipation of
*  this podcast. I just know that anybody else in the universe would have thought, oh, he's writing
*  something down about the Saudis. I know you, I know what you wrote. Anyway, hilarious. Anyway,
*  I love it that this is a podcast where brilliant books may be born. So, okay, there's Philby and
*  he's sort of, you know, filling his new best friend, the oil magnet that is Ibn Saud with,
*  you know, sort of building up his already existing suspicion of the British. So what happens next?
*  He cuts a deal with the Americans for oil rights and cuts the British out,
*  which satisfies Ibn Saud and increasingly Philby. So two generations of traitors to the British
*  cause. Yes. I mean, this one's a little bit more transparent. He's on the payroll of the Americans
*  and so he's advocating for their commercial interests over those of Britain. But at the same
*  time, he's growing alienated from Britain and Ibn Saud, who is very suspicious of the British for
*  having propped up the Sharif in Mecca for so long, they're sort of, they reinforce each other in
*  conversation as it were. But mostly because he's paid to do it, Harry St. John Philby cuts a deal
*  with the Americans as the exclusive producers initially of oil in Eastern Saudi Arabia.
*  What an extraordinary story. It's so interesting. So when you've got these oil deals,
*  you've got lots of money coming in. Does that transform Riyadh very quickly? Because one would
*  assume that that money gets spent. Yes. How quickly do things change now?
*  I mean, the gold starts coming in. What Ibn Saud wants is gold. He doesn't want dollars,
*  he doesn't want sterling, he wants gold. And he used that to build. Initially in Riyadh,
*  he started to build a palace outside the walls of the historical one. And he's making, yes,
*  he has started to transform things fairly quickly in the late 1920s. But remember, on the horizon
*  is the Great Depression, which is going to affect the oil industry, global travel, revenues in the
*  hijaz, as well as the amount of gold he can get in a given year. But while he's got the gold coming
*  in, while he's, you know, there are contracts going out for building, transforming Riyadh,
*  building Saudi Arabia, basically. And one of the people who's central to the property boom
*  that follows is Mohammed bin Laden. Yes.
*  Guess who his son was, will you?
*  Do you think you can get away with that?
*  There we go. We can write, yes, a double father and son biography.
*  And it's just writing itself, frankly. It's getting more complicated in this book.
*  Yeah. So tell us about Mohammed bin Laden and what was his sort of position in all of this?
*  So Mohammed bin Laden was born in the Hadramaut in Yemen and migrated to
*  Jeddah as a boy, walked there with his brother. Literally walked.
*  Yes, literally. Well, took a ship and then walked a lot of the distance where a ship wasn't workable.
*  And he arrived at perhaps 11 or 12 in Jeddah as basically a street urchin, got a job hauling
*  baggage and then made his way into the building trades during the late teens.
*  In the 1920s, he moved to Dehran in eastern Saudi Arabia as the Americans got going with oil
*  production. And he learned to build there as a bricklayer, essentially taking advantage of the
*  boom that the American oil production was creating. And then once he learned how to build things,
*  he took advantage of his language and his flexibility and ambition to ingratiate himself
*  with Ibn Saud in Riyadh and started to get the first contracts as a palace builder for the royal
*  family. My brain is just exploding. This is just so...
*  It's extraordinary how all these things come together.
*  It's recent history and every, yeah, the whole picture starts to form. It's amazing.
*  So bin Laden accumulates wealth too and he actually ends up being a creditor to the king.
*  Well, if you wanted to do business with the king, you really had no choice but to be a creditor.
*  And this was something that...
*  His perfect bills stuck out.
*  Yes. And essentially this was not a contracting economy that was very well regulated. There were
*  no laws to follow. There were no courts to seek redress in. So you basically had to be patient
*  and to work on the king's terms and hope that his sense of conscience and his desire to have
*  you come back and finish the wall you started would result in him handing over some of his gold.
*  But bin Laden was over time brilliant at allowing debts to build up in his favor
*  and continuing to get the job done. He was also incredibly flexible about change orders,
*  which was important since the princes that he worked for, including Ibn Saud,
*  the king were constantly changing their minds about what they wanted and how they wanted it
*  to look. And each day that he worked on some change that had come to him overnight
*  was another day that he built up credit. And there would be moments when he would humbly petition
*  for the clearing of the books and the king might nod and somebody would bring a satchel of gold
*  to him that evening and he would be back at square one. He did get paid, but sometimes he had to wait
*  three to six months to be paid.
*  So time marches on around him. Riyadh is growing and it's not really fits and starts. People are
*  being paid in fits and starts, but Riyadh keeps growing. That was how he was. He keeps growing
*  very, very quickly. But as the kingdom grows, the man himself at the heart of this starts to diminish
*  somewhat, doesn't he? I mean, is it just age and exhaustion that starts reducing this towering
*  six foot three charismatic political figure giant in the desert that he was?
*  Across the 1930s and 1940s, he ages and suffers increasingly. He has cataracts. His
*  war wounded legs begin to fail him and he needs to be carried around on a chair or moved on a
*  wheelchair where there are surfaces. He starts to build palaces around the kingdom. He now presides
*  over and one of the problems is, how do you get him inside when he can't walk and you don't want
*  to parade him in an undignified way against in front of onlookers as he makes his way from his
*  automobile to the door? And so they build ramps into car ramps into one of his palaces so he can
*  drive onto the second floor and then walks directly onto his throne.
*  That's amazing.
*  But he couldn't see by the end and that was one of the losses of pleasure that he complained about.
*  Steve, there's a lovely moment in 1951 just towards the end in your book when
*  Adlaziz is shifting his entourage from Riyadh to Taif in the summer and you say it takes
*  55 flights over three days to get his young fleet to the other palace.
*  Yes, I mean just as Wahhabism did not deter him from the automobile, it did not deter him from
*  the aircraft either and he became a very active buyer of aircraft and flyer and brought in pilots
*  to help him out and he used those. And of course, none of his sons who were growing up now to be
*  princes, heirs to the realm and not all of them vigorous about their exercise, they generally
*  preferred to ride around in cars and fly in planes. I mean in fairness, sudden wealth,
*  they had lived in poverty for centuries. They associated walking and camels and horses with
*  an age of poverty that was behind them and they embraced the conveniences of transport technology
*  with real gusto as a result. So they flew everywhere.
*  Yeah, I mean there is a saying, isn't there? It's clogs to clogs in three generations but
*  that only happens when you don't have oil gushing out of the ground. You can afford to get even
*  better clogs. So look, I mean he sort of dwindles. He passes away. What year does he actually die?
*  Is it 1953 or 1951?
*  Okay, so the early 1950s. What state does he leave the kingdom in?
*  Well, he had many children by his hundreds of wives. He recognized ultimately somewhat more
*  than five dozen sons as his legitimate heirs and he faced a central question which how would this
*  kingdom that he had built be preserved and ruled in his absence?
*  Which is the only country in the world named after one man, isn't it? Do you mean the others?
*  I don't know but I can't immediately think of another one.
*  Twitter will tell us if we're wrong but it sounds right. I can't think of another one.
*  Yeah, I mean it's certainly not the sort of form of possession, you know, this the Arabia of the
*  South.
*  The Hashemite kingdom of Jordan, I suppose, is near almost.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, but no one says Hashemite Jordan, do they just say Jordan, don't they?
*  In any event, I find fascinating because it affects Saudi Arabia today. This problem he had
*  of succession. There was no clear rule of succession in Saudi Arabia among the Bedouins that he, you know,
*  took influence from. There was no rule of primogeniture. There was no alternative rule.
*  I think that's true of the Islamic world as a whole. There's never been a rule of
*  primogeniture. It's a western thing and you find that that's the reason, for example, that every
*  Mughal emperor ends with an enormous five-way fight between all the different sons after.
*  And the Ottomans galloping back to the, you know, to the throne and having to kill all their brothers
*  to make sure that nobody challenges them. So what happens in the House of Saud?
*  Well, he was thinking about the practical problem of his eldest son, Saud, who was not fit to rule.
*  He had become a very heavy drinker. He was obese. He had no political ambition. He lacked
*  connections to the Ikhwan or he had lost their respect. But his next son, Faisal, was an austere
*  and more organized and purposeful individual who, you know, ultimately lived monogamously for a time
*  in his life and had an interest in modernity as a state-building project. And Ibn Saud recognized
*  that Faisal was the suitable heir, but he also didn't want to disrupt his family or create a
*  bloody conflict by passing over Saud, who desperately wanted to be king. So he basically
*  arranged a succession that where power would move laterally from eldest to youngest son after he
*  was gone, starting with Ibn Saud and Faisal as the prime minister to Saud's kingship. And on his death
*  bed, he essentially put that deal together. These brothers were not close. They had different mothers.
*  They were different personalities. But Faisal was loyal and perhaps quietly ambitious enough to see
*  that it was in his interest to accept this role as the man who would actually run everything while
*  Saud sat around in his palace. Steve, how far in Ibn Wahhab's own life do you begin to get the
*  export of Wahhabism around the Islamic world? Because that, in a sense, is the biggest global
*  result of this, along with the power of the Saudis in terms of their oil wealth.
*  I mean, I think it really begins after the Second World War, along with a lot of other
*  features of the global oil age and Saudi Arabian power within it. And so I would say
*  it may have begun in the 1950s as clerically led oil-funded charities within Saudi Arabia began
*  to move out of the kingdom to neighboring countries in the Middle East and to establish mosques and
*  seminaries and sort of proselytizing platforms. Because this is responsible for a massive change
*  in the nature of Islam within our lifetimes today. So Steve, out of these new Wahhabi madrassas come
*  in due course what? Well, the Taliban, al-Qaeda. I mean, in Pakistan, for example, these institutions
*  that were already present in 1979 when the Soviet Union invaded spread and gained influence and
*  became part of the resistance to the Soviet occupation in Afghanistan. And they influenced
*  the Islamist outlook of the Afghan fighters, but also attracted Arab volunteers, including
*  Osama bin Laden. And out of some of these seminaries came sections, puritanical sections of the Afghan
*  resistance, including the groups we now call the Taliban. And particularly this one isn't there,
*  which is hugely important, the Darul-ul-um in a Korak-atak near Attak. This is the cradle,
*  in a sense, founded very largely by the Saudis. Yeah, I mean, the Haqqanis, the Taliban. I mean,
*  its theology has roots in Wahhabism and also in Dioband. But it was- Our friend Shah Waliullah,
*  who we talked about at the beginning, who comes out of the same seminaries as Dioband-Wahhab,
*  and then these two streams of puritanical Islam meet at this crucial moment.
*  They do. And they become political. They become politicized and they become militarized and they
*  become a battlefield cry as well as a form of individual devotion and Islamic theology and
*  learning. So, yes, I mean, these ideas fired the imaginations of many volunteers in the Afghan war.
*  They explain the thinking that led to the 9-11 attacks. They were literally the only education
*  that the Taliban leadership had in the 1990s when they took power.
*  SIMON HUGHES-TAMPTON TURK, PhD, PhD, UTSS, UTSS, UTSS, UTSS, UTSS, UTSS, UTSS, UTSS, UTSS,
*  Taliban meaning student and they are students at these Wahhabi madrassas.
*  Yes.
*  And do they continue to grow and proliferate? I mean, we talked about 9-11. We talked about
*  this coming together of different strands of the same ideology or from the same root,
*  if you like, the same taproot.
*  Yeah, I mean, they do. They continue. The investment continues to flow. The oil age has
*  not ended or deprived Saudi institutions of the funds needed to build new mosques or to hire and
*  pay clerics all around the world and to vet them for their adherence to their theology and outlook.
*  I mean, in my experience, if you ask a Muslim friend where they pray and you ask them,
*  are you aware of sort of, is there a quote unquote Saudi mosque in your neighborhood or in your
*  region or do you feel their influence? I have never asked that question without getting an
*  emphatic and alarmed yes in Los Angeles or in Minneapolis or in Delhi or any number of other
*  places.
*  And many people I don't think understand this. It is specifically that Saudi funding that has
*  encouraged this strain. We've seen in the last few weeks the Taliban embracing China in a way
*  that we would have thought imaginable two or three years ago. And we've seen this new deal
*  between the Saudis and Iran brokered by China. Do you see Saudi in the future heading into the
*  Chinese orbit? Is that something that you think is likely now?
*  I think China will become much more important to Saudi Arabia. They already are important
*  customers and they may remain consumers of oil for longer than Europe and the United States do
*  if Europe and the United States make the energy transitions that they're talking about.
*  Saudi Arabia, like most mid-sized powers, would like to have balanced relations with the great
*  powers of the world. It preserves one's independence, gives you a little bit more
*  maneuvering room. So I don't think anybody wants to be China's client. But in order to have
*  maneuvering room in today's world, having correct relations with both China and the United States
*  and possibly Russia as well is the preferred policy of the middle guys in this world.
*  Absolutely fascinating. So, so interesting.
*  You're ungrateful, Steve. Thank you so, so much.
*  And to take us from the ancient sand to the modern day, it's wonderful and it's brilliant
*  to have had you on. Can I just recommend, and I really can't recommend it enough,
*  the Bin Laden's by Steve Cole, Oil, Money, Terrorism and the Secret Saudi World.
*  I've got a different subtitle than my one. It says the story of a family and its fortune,
*  which we've got different editions. I've got the better edition.
*  Anyway, look, that is all from us here on Empire. Till next time, it's goodbye from me, Anita Arnand.
*  And goodbye from me, William Durampo. You saved it till the end. Just I wouldn't
*  tell you off in front of Steve Cole. You did. You did that so sneaky.
