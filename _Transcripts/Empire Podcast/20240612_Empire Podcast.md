Video Description: The British have surrendered, theyâ€™ll be leaving soon. Now the Americans have a new and arguably harder task than before. They have to meld those 13 states, each with their own sense of independence and unique characteristics, into a country. Taking inspiration from Rome, the Enlightenment, and their own experience of British rule, the Founding Fathers created a republic that lasts until today. Listen as William and Anita are joined by Maya for the last of our episodes on the American Revolution.

*  Hello and welcome to Empire with me, Anita Arnon.
*  And me, William Durimple.
*  And we are now in the final episode of our, why do I say magnificent? I think it's magnificent
*  because of Maya, but a magnificent mini-series on the American Revolution with Maya Jasanoff.
*  And it's a stirring story.
*  Well it is. Do you want to remind people where we are in case, you know, they've had a couple
*  of days and walked a few dogs in between listening to these two episodes.
*  Well, great deal of ironing. So first of all, we had all our founding fathers. We looked
*  at Washington, we looked at Franklin, we looked at Hamilton, and all the rest of them before
*  the revolution, keying us up for the outbreak of hostilities with the Boston Massacre, followed
*  by the Boston Tea Party. We saw how the British overreacted to the Boston Tea Party, alienating
*  many of their own supporters and driving many who had previously been loyalists into the
*  arms of those who wanted to get rid of Britain and particularly to get rid of the King. And
*  so within two years you have a Declaration of Independence, which is far stronger and
*  far more radical than what even many of the most committed patriots had imagined two years
*  earlier.
*  The events are very, very surprising to many of the participants. No one expects that the
*  Patriots will be able to defeat the British Army, which after all has only 13 years before
*  won a major world war in the Seven Year War. And in Washington, the Patriots get an extraordinary
*  leader who continually uses the country and conducts a series of small scale skirmishes
*  and hit and run attacks, which breaks down the British Army. And eventually after the
*  Battle of Saratoga and then the siege of Yorktown, the French come in and encircle the British
*  at Yorktown. There is a surrender. Huge numbers of British troops are left to evacuate, which
*  brings us to where we are now. So what is this country which has just been born? What
*  does it look like? Presumably it's battle scarred with...
*  Naked.
*  Yeah.
*  Naked and broke.
*  It's a debt with burnt down buildings and ravaged countryside. Or is that not the situation?
*  Tell me.
*  I wondered for a minute if you were describing Britain. Obviously it doesn't have the burnt
*  down buildings or ravaged countryside, but it sure is the one in debt. You know, what's
*  the United States? Well, it's a bunch of these entities, now states, their independence has
*  been recognized by France, by Spain. It's governed loosely by this thing called the
*  Articles of Confederation. It has an army. It has a few significant figures who can claim
*  the title of statesman. And it has the beginnings, I think, of various kinds of, well, patriotic
*  identity. But it also continues to be hugely varied. One of the things I've been talking
*  about a lot, you know, you have areas that are, you know, plantation economy, heavily
*  tied to slavery. You have commercial ports. You have independent farmers. I mean, just
*  all kinds of differences geographically, culturally, demographically and more. What
*  you also have in 1781 is a lot of British troops still stationed in the United States.
*  And one of the things that I think people tend to overlook about the history of the
*  American Revolution is that it actually took quite a long time from the Battle of Yorktown
*  in October of 1781 to the evacuation of the British in November of 1783, fully two years
*  later. The beast doesn't realize that it's had been cut off. It still thinks it's alive.
*  Well, it's I'm not quite sure I'd put it that way. But I would say that it takes a long
*  time to hash out the terms of peace. Why? Because you have to unravel a whole set of
*  relationships. And this is really, in many ways, a precursor to what will happen, say,
*  with the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947. That is to say, you know, the British
*  are going to leave this place, but what are they going to leave it with? And they have
*  to get their people out and they have to get their resources out. And there has to be a
*  lot of negotiation about what counts as British, what counts as American, etc. And all of that
*  takes a lot of time being hashed out by a bunch of peace commissioners in Paris, including
*  Benjamin Franklin on the American side, including Richard Oswald on the British side, who's
*  a business partner of one of the American patriots, Henry Lawrence, and had been involved
*  with him in slave trading in Sierra Leone. So, you know, there's all these sort of weird
*  connections between these people. So there's a few things that they have to work out. One
*  of the things that they have to work out is whose property counts as what. This is important
*  when it comes to the question of the so-called black loyalists, because, again, these are
*  the enslaved people who had run to the British in exchange for promised freedom and whom
*  the British gave freedom to quite poignantly in some ways in New York City toward the end
*  of the war as the peace negotiations are kind of coming to a close and it's clear that the
*  British are going to leave. The British make a point of issuing certificates of freedom
*  people in New York City who had fought for them so that they will have this document
*  that can help confirm their freedom to anybody who asks them. At that time, if you were a
*  black person in the US, people were going to assume you were enslaved. So this certificate
*  is really important. Anyway, in American eyes, of course, these enslaved individuals are
*  actually property. And there's a striking moment when the then British commander, again,
*  there's changes in the British command all the way through, but the man who's sort of
*  tasked with unwinding the whole operation is called Sir Guy Carlton. Sir Guy Carlton
*  meets George Washington to have a conversation about how the British are going to evacuate
*  and all of that. And Washington says to him, what about the property that you owe us, meaning
*  the slaves? And Carlton says, I don't know what you're talking about. The people that
*  I found in New York who were free, they're embarked. They've gone off to Canada. They're
*  free. And Washington is just staggered. And he may not know at that very moment that some
*  of his own former slaves are on those British ships taking them away. So this is just one
*  of many, many examples, but I think a really powerful one, of the ways in which these two
*  nations have to untangle themselves and also the ways in which the ideas undergirding their
*  positions diverge. Other issues include whether the British will evacuate various forts that
*  lie outside US territory, but very much within a kind of US sphere of interest. This is in the
*  regions around, for example, the Great Lakes that had been the site of Pontiac's rebellion before
*  the Revolutionary War. The issues include what will happen to the property of the loyalists,
*  that is the American civilians who had, among other things, sought shelter within British
*  lines of the occupied cities of Savannah, Charleston and New York.
*  This had become an issue even at the surrender in Yorktown, hasn't it? Article 10 of the
*  surrender had said there will be no punishment of the loyalists who support Britain and
*  Washington refuses to sign it. And that article is taken out of the treaty.
*  There's a lot of tension around this issue. The loyalists are worried about a few things.
*  They're worried, first of all, about whether they're going to be physically safe. I mean, you
*  know, are they going to actually be tried and hanged and whatever, you know, after the
*  war? Second, they're worried about their property.
*  Many places loyalist property had been confiscated by state legislatures, even if it
*  hadn't been formally confiscated.
*  If you obviously if you leave your farm and you go as a refugee into a British-held city, you
*  have no idea what's going to happen to that farm that you left behind.
*  And this is a feature of the negotiations that unfolds in Paris with a particular twist insofar
*  as efforts to ensure that the loyalists would be protected and get their property back are
*  promoted by some of the peace commissioners.
*  But ultimately, a somewhat more favorable version of an article regarding loyalists is
*  overturned by none other than Benjamin Franklin, whose own son, William Franklin, had
*  been the royal governor of New Jersey and had evacuated, I mean, had left the U.S.
*  as a loyalist refugee and was settled in Britain.
*  The two were not friends, it's fair to say.
*  They had a very troubled relationship.
*  Yeah. And so, you know, people would later say, you know, that Franklin, out of sort of
*  addictiveness, basically prevented a more generous settlement for the loyalists.
*  But it shows the complexity, isn't it?
*  It shows the deep ties that bind these people and the degree to which, as you say, it is a
*  civil war.
*  Absolutely. Other things that have to be worked out are issues to do with borders.
*  You know, we talked already about how France and Spain want to get their own back and Spain
*  will retake Florida.
*  The British agreed to surrender it.
*  So there's a long journey for some of the loyalist refugees who are evacuated with the
*  British from South Carolina and Georgia, where they go to Florida thinking that they can
*  settle there, that it's still a British colony, only then to find out that Florida is going to
*  be handed back to Spain.
*  And if they want to stay, they have to swear loyalty to the King of Spain, who's Catholic.
*  And that doesn't sit well with many of them.
*  So there's just a lot of moving parts.
*  And by the way, there's even still fighting between these militias who have been at each
*  other's throats for a while.
*  So it's a very unsettled time.
*  You and your book have lots of examples of loyalists suffering sort of mob violence at
*  this point. Do you want to tell us a little of that?
*  I mean, some of that happens earlier during the conflict and before it.
*  One had seen versions of this exercised as early as the Stamp Act violence, which is
*  targeting specific individuals who are understood to be aligned with the British, the
*  practice of tarring and feathering, which is a really gruesome punishment.
*  I mean, just a gruesome thing to do to somebody.
*  Particularly if the tar is very hot.
*  It leads you to hospital.
*  Well, which by definition, it has to be.
*  Otherwise, they won't stick to you.
*  Yeah.
*  So no, it's an absolutely gruesome thing.
*  So that sort of thing had been going on earlier.
*  And it's because of that sort of thing that a lot of the loyalists are very anxious about
*  what's going to happen to them in the independent United States.
*  So you arrive via the evacuations of Savannah and Charleston, which Sir Guy Carlton is
*  organizing in New York City in the fall of 1783, where the largest number, you know,
*  tens of thousands of British troops and loyalists are all consolidated.
*  And if you're a civilian in this situation, you really have to figure out what you're
*  going to do. You know, the British end up mounting what I would consider to be one of
*  the largest programs of state-sponsored refugee relief in British history at that, you
*  know, up to that time by offering the loyalists free passage to another British colony, land
*  grants in notably for the people from New York, Nova Scotia, and some sort of basic
*  supplies and provisions and so on of a sort that they had been doling out in different
*  parts of the states before.
*  And, Maya, before we leave that thought, could you give an example?
*  I mean, you and I, for example, have written about some of the loyalists who at this point
*  make their way via England to India, Sir David Octolone, a Scot born in Boston who
*  spends the rest of his life in India, William Linnaeus Gardner, godson of the botanist
*  Linnaeus, born on the banks of the Hudson, a loyalist who ends up dying on the banks
*  of the Ganges, having been a mercenary fighting for the Marathas in a variety of unorthodox
*  wars in northern India.
*  Give us a few of those sort of stories.
*  So all of this kind of comes to a head when you're in New York City in 1783.
*  And, you know, all of these civilians have to figure out what to do.
*  And there's an incredible scene when Washington is coming in to take control of the city
*  and he's marching in from the north and at the south end, you know, like where Wall Street
*  is, the British are leaving on the ships and they're sort of pulling out just as the
*  Americans are coming in.
*  And these ships go fanning out, you know, and in effect, if you trace where the loyalists
*  go, you get a map of the expanding British Empire.
*  So to take some examples from New York State, there's a family called the Robinson
*  family who are pretty wealthy landowners of the Hudson Valley.
*  And the patriarch of the family, Beverly Robinson, is an acquaintance of George Washington.
*  And he is kind of on the fence for a while at the beginning of the conflict.
*  He doesn't want to have to take sides if he can avoid it, which is, by the way, a position
*  many, many people have.
*  But he ultimately decides he's going to be loyal and he and his sons all end up in British
*  military service one way or another.
*  And in the years ahead, they end up all over the place.
*  You know, one of them is in Gibraltar, a bunch of them are in Canada, some of them end up
*  in India. You know, they just go everywhere.
*  It's only the really the wealthiest of best connected loyalists who move to Britain and
*  find a comfortable home for themselves there.
*  It's an expensive country, among other things.
*  One of them, though, is Benedict Arnold, and he'll be there and he'll be sort of, you know,
*  continuing to be a somewhat cantankerous fellow for the rest of his life.
*  But he works really hard to make sure that his own sons end up well provided for.
*  And how does he do that? He places two of them in the East India Company and two of
*  Benedict Arnold's sons end up going off to India, which is the coming place, even as
*  the U.S. has the gallant place.
*  India is the coming place. They go off to India where they will end up, you know, serving
*  the East India Company, settling with Indian women, having in at least one case a family
*  with an Indian woman. And for all I know, there are descendants of Benedict Arnold in
*  India today, perhaps in more numbers than there are in the U.S.
*  Bloody hell! Just a minute.
*  Mind blown. OK, just let that happen for a second.
*  Wow. Would it also be true to say, or is this too much of a stretch, that losing America
*  hardens the attitude of Britain towards India?
*  That, you know what, we've seen what it's like to have this place slip through our
*  fingers. We're not going to make the same mistakes again.
*  Do they suddenly change or revise the way in which they're going to interact with
*  Indians in India?
*  I think the big change with the loss of the American colonies is that the focal point,
*  as it were, of British imperial attention is India.
*  And more than that, that the nature of the empire itself ceases to be as fundamentally
*  colonial, by which I mean white colonial settlements.
*  Now, that remains a big part of the empire.
*  Australia is the immediate site in which that happens right after the loss of America
*  in 1788.
*  But India, which is already, of course, economically vastly more significant than many
*  other places for the British Empire, will be the capital, as it were, of British imperial
*  attention henceforth.
*  It's a second centre of empire in many ways, with its own huge military and much more
*  besides. And the fundamental difference in India, well, there are so many, I hesitate to
*  say the fundamental, but one is that India is never a site of British colonial settlement.
*  There's a relatively small number of British people, but there are millions of Hindu, Muslim,
*  Sikh and other Indian subjects.
*  And the British crown, therefore, becomes a monarchy that is promising subjecthood or
*  something, something to huge numbers of people who are not English speaking, who are not
*  white, who are not Christian.
*  And I think that really changes the bargain, as it were, around what the British monarchy on
*  the British Empire is promising.
*  The point in America for the colonists who broke off into the United States was that they
*  understood themselves to be exactly like the British subjects.
*  To be equal.
*  Yeah, to be like white people in the British Isles.
*  And they discovered that, no, they didn't have the same sort of representation.
*  And going forward, the British government, parliament, crown sort of leans into that and
*  says, no, you guys are not going to be exactly the same.
*  But if you're loyal to us, we will give you various things, include some semblance of
*  religious tolerance, include some versions of accountability, which generally take the form
*  of in some places, local legislatures and the right to petition the king, which remains a
*  very important right and in a constitutional monarchy.
*  It also comes with authority and with strings attached, you know, armies being stationed
*  there, you know, the right to raise revenue in different ways.
*  You know, that will all be very much part and parcel of the empire going forward.
*  Yeah. So, I mean, in that deal, you're never going to get Indians, you know, for example,
*  doing what sparked the Boston massacre, that we object to having a garrison in our city,
*  because that's just understood that's what happens.
*  Well, you do have it.
*  You do have that.
*  I think the Amritsar massacre is an example of that.
*  I mean, that is to say the Indians are protesting martial rule.
*  But let's just say the valence is different.
*  I mean, the idea that we are equally British, I think, is not one that you see in quite
*  the same way. I do want to add it doesn't ever go away entirely.
*  And Canada is the real mirror to the United States in many ways, not least because large
*  numbers of Americans go to Canada first in the wave of loyalists who evacuate immediately
*  and are so numerous that they really populate Nova Scotia a great deal, which it's then
*  divided into two. The province of New Brunswick takes shape at that time.
*  But second, in the immediate aftermath of the revolution in the next couple of decades,
*  there's a huge migration of what are called late loyalists, that is to say, migrants
*  to the colonies or people of the United States who see the promise of cheap land and lower
*  taxes in Canada and what's now Ontario and are perfectly prepared to swear loyalty to
*  the king if that's what they end up getting over there instead of in the Great Lakes region.
*  One of the ironies, of course, is that Cornwallis, who we last saw hired after his surrender
*  at Yorktown, is hired by the government and the East India Company as governor general
*  of the British Dominions in India.
*  And what the lesson he takes from it is that he sees that the threat comes not from the
*  Indian equivalent of the Native Americans, in other words, the Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs,
*  but from the white settlers who are there either as white colonists or as in many cases as
*  Anglo-Indians. And there are cities like Calcutta which have very large Anglo-Indian
*  populations. And Cornwallis passes a series of laws to make sure that those guys never rise
*  up high enough to be a threat to the British Empire. So important laws that he passes at this
*  point forbid, for example, the children of East India Company officials who are born in India from
*  entering East India Company service except as bandsmen or at a very, very low level as clerks
*  or running the post offices.
*  There's also a very important law that he forbids the buying of private property by many British
*  officials. There are exceptions like those who plant indigo who are allowed to buy land for
*  commercial purposes for indigo plantations. But by and large, it means that for the whole of British
*  rule in India, the British do not own land. And that when therefore they finish their service at
*  the end of 20 or 30 years, they retire back to Tunbridge Wells, they retire back to or possibly
*  to Australia. And therefore in 1947, the British leave India very quickly with very few roots in
*  the soil, unlike say the Pied Noir in Algeria who fight to the end to retain their place in
*  Algeria and have to be removed with great difficulty and much bloodshed. So in a sense,
*  what happens here, you could argue, eases the eventual dissolution of the British in India and
*  allows them to leave with almost no bloodshed among the white civilian population. But of
*  course, there is 1.5 million that die in partition. Well, look, let's take a break at this point. And
*  when we come back from the break, we've looked at the sort of the pebble that's been dropped and
*  the ripples that reach out to the rest of the empire. But what the hell does America do next?
*  So join us after the break and we'll talk about that.
*  Welcome back. So just before the break, we were talking about the impact that the loss of America
*  has on the British Empire, the British psyche and most immediately on places like the East India
*  Company. And I love, Maya, the work that you've done on loyalists and how they settle in Canada
*  and back in Great Britain. It's fascinating, absolutely fascinating stuff. Benedict Arnold,
*  he has brown grandchildren. Let me just repeat that brain explosion that happened before the
*  break. Can we talk about America? Because America is born, you know, it's great. The party is
*  fantastic. The hangover must have hurt like hell because now they've got to make a country. So how
*  do you even start going about making a country when you have been actually riven by, as you've
*  said numerous times, civil war? You know, you've got to rebuild and give a cohesive identity to a
*  new country. How do they do that? The key thing that they have to do is create some sort of
*  governing structure, which is going to be crucial for this. They've been governed by the Articles
*  of Confederation, which don't have a lot of flexibility to them. It's a very unwieldy
*  instrument. And they set to work trying to draft a constitution which will work for the United States
*  as a whole. This will come to fruition in 1787, but not only do they have to write the constitution,
*  they have to persuade people to get behind it. And this is the object of the documents known
*  as the Federalist Papers, in which John Jay, James Madison, and others will play such a huge role.
*  They have to figure out finances, which Alexander Hamilton, of course, is quite significant in doing.
*  They have to come up with all of these governing institutions just to make the place work,
*  legally, administratively, financially. Then there's the whole question of some kind of shared
*  culture. And this is its own big project, which we can see taking shape right away in the creation
*  of national heroes and symbols, George Washington being really the first and greatest of them.
*  The Patriots draw extensively on the imagery of the Romans. Not long after the British evacuate,
*  they sail off from New York City, Washington marches down. He and his officers get together
*  in a tavern which still exists on the southern tip of Manhattan, the Francis Tavern, and a group of
*  his officers form an organization which they call the Society of the Cincinnati, likening George
*  Washington to the General Cincinnati of Roman history.
*  Oh my God, really? That's just only just slotted into place in my brain. Wow, okay. I often wondered
*  why Senate, instead of upper house, or, all right, you don't want to have a House of Lords or House
*  of Commons, but Senate is such a Roman identification.
*  They're very into the Roman mix of military prowess and republicanism. They're very much
*  and republicanism. They're very excited about that. Washington is their Cincinnati. They
*  will call him out of retirement, as it were, after the war to become the first president
*  in a Cincinnati's kind of way. And I do think that the personalities of some of these figures
*  is important. I don't buy into the great man theory of history particularly,
*  but I think we do have to note that this cadre of Americans at the helm of the new nation
*  were relatively, partly because I think they were relatively united in their educations and
*  their outlook and so on, were able to sort of turn themselves into a kind of national leadership.
*  So if we look at the revolutionary era as an era of civil war, and we see there as being kind of
*  tensions between patriots and loyalists, maybe republicans and people less excited about
*  republicanism, we can see those differences sort of move into the period of the early American
*  Republic as the beginnings of political party differences. You have a faction in America who
*  leans much more heavily toward alliances with Britain and toward more compatibility with Britain,
*  smoother trade relations, etc.
*  I guess that would be Adams-Hamilton, that kind of camp.
*  Exactly.
*  People say that's the only way we're going to exist.
*  After the peace treaty is signed, our relations with Britain are on a fairly even kill. There's
*  no sense of horror and hatred.
*  Well, they do write sort of treaties to each other and say, you know, bygones,
*  let's just start again. You know, there doesn't seem to be that animosity.
*  So there's a couple of things to say here. One is that the British make good terms with the
*  Americans. That is to say the British are not particularly vindictive in the treaty. Obviously
*  they can't be. I mean, that is they're on the losing side. But they make terms with the Americans,
*  which are seen by some hardliners in Britain as being too concessionary toward the Americans.
*  Vice versa, I should add, that there are also some Americans who are far more anti-British.
*  But that opposition really comes to a head around the time of what's called the Jay Treaty in 1794,
*  named for John Jay, its American negotiator, which establishes favorable trade relationships,
*  basically, between Britain and the US and is fiercely opposed by the anti-British faction.
*  Now, the bigger context for this is, I think, twofold. It is that in the first instance,
*  very few people believe that the United States is going to stay united. This is, as everybody knows,
*  a group of states that have been cobbled together where there's huge differences and differences in
*  interest, potentially. If you live in South Carolina, you care a lot more about your trade
*  relationships with, say, Barbados or Britain than you do with the cod fisheries of the North Atlantic.
*  And if you live in Massachusetts, you care a lot more about a set of ways of managing your political
*  culture or something like that. You run things differently. You have your town meetings, that
*  sort of thing. Then you care about, say, slavery, which increasingly you really don't like at all.
*  There's a lot of differences, and people assume, the Spanish assume, the French assume, the British
*  assume, that this is all going to fall apart and that, therefore, the best thing you can do is be
*  ready to swoop in and grab the piece of it that you can when it falls apart.
*  Yeah. Just be there. Just don't alienate them so much that when it does all crumble,
*  you don't have any friends. But you just started by saying there are some who are very still
*  well-disposed to having some kind of relationship that you cannot exist without Britain. That would
*  be, again, to repeat, probably Washington, definitely Adams, definitely Hamilton.
*  And then on the other side, you have those who ally themselves completely with France
*  and, therefore, are anti-British. And Jefferson, I guess, Madison, they would count themselves
*  among those who have nothing but deep suspicion of the British and find anything, including the
*  J presentation as treachery because, you know, why on earth are we kissing the bottom of those
*  people who have oppressed us for so many years? So almost what I find completely fascinating is
*  that right on the birth of the nation, you have the birth of two political schools of thought,
*  which kind of almost remain to this day, the Jeffersonian side, which is very much,
*  we don't have centralized control because we're not replacing one king with another in the form
*  of a president who has all the powers that the king once had and the other saying, actually,
*  my God, we've got to hold this together. And the only way we can hold this together is by some kind
*  of centralized power structure in the form and the person of the president. So it's, to me,
*  amazing that those first cries of a new country come in two voices right from the get-go. I mean,
*  I think that's remarkable. The other piece of this I want to cite is the question of the West. So
*  you've got, for example, your Francophiles and your Anglophiles duking it out. You have your
*  people who prefer a strong central executive to your people who prefer states' rights.
*  You also have your people who are leaning West as opposed to your people who are leaning East,
*  if you will. One of the things that Jefferson particularly does when he's president is to
*  promote this idea of the United States as what he calls an empire for liberty. Nowadays, we think
*  about the Republic, the United States, as being intrinsically anti-imperial, but it's not at all
*  how people understood it at the time. Empires were what big states were. It was a thing to aspire
*  to be. The United States and its founders aspired to be imperial rulers. And one of the ways they
*  would do that would be to expand Westward. And Westward expansion, the ability to grab land,
*  the ability to kill the Indians, to find more space for slavery, these were all very driving
*  purposes for many Americans in the early Republic. And ultimately, this is what goes into the
*  purchase of the Louisiana territory from Napoleon. Ultimately, this is one of the causes belly for
*  the War of 1812 against Britain. And I mentioned a minute ago that there's another big context we
*  have to put this in, and that is the context of the French Revolution and the Haitian Revolution.
*  And what will, of course, going into the 19th century, be all of the Republican revolutions
*  in Latin America. And this is a sense that the world order is sort of turning on, you know,
*  away from absolutist monarchy, but is maybe becoming quite congenial to certain kinds of sort of
*  Republican, Democratic empires, if you will. And I would argue that Britain represents a flavor of
*  it. It's not Republican, and it's not Democratic, but it is in its own view, constitutional. And the
*  United States, which sees itself obviously as Republican and Democratic, but of course, in
*  practice is not, insofar as it has slavery and excludes all sorts of people, but definitely sees
*  itself as imperial. So it's a fascinating period of history, but I think it's one that well deserves
*  our attention today. Because when we nowadays, I think, sort of draw very clean lines between what
*  we consider to be imperial and non-imperial, between what we consider to be settler colonial
*  and what we consider not to be, what we consider to be indigenous. You know, we just don't want to sort
*  of put all these things together to realize that, you know, that even the United States is sort of
*  all of these things at once. Mya, you've talked about the different cleavages, the Anglophiles
*  and the Francophiles and so on. Are there cleavages between those who are very strongly imperial
*  in the new America, or are they all very strongly imperial? Do they all think that they're going to
*  be moving westwards and conquering over the Appalachians and breaking into new territories?
*  There are definitely differences of opinion about how all of this should happen. A critical one is
*  whether slavery is going to expand or not, which is, of course, ultimately one of the key provocation
*  really for the Civil War. There's questions about what should happen to Indians and notoriously,
*  Andrew Jackson, who's just a complete bloodthirsty Indian killer, basically, has no compunctions
*  about pursuing an ethnic cleansing and genocide against Indians, which is not universally held,
*  though he's president. He's on one of our banknotes, you know. But no, I mean, you know,
*  there's political division in America. There are different visions for things. But I guess what I
*  want to say is that the concept of the United States as an empire in the sense of having a kind
*  of geopolitical footprint, this is something that a lot of people get behind and I would say is really
*  dominant in the political consciousness of the early republic.
*  Now, I mean, it's such a complicated thing to look upon. I mean, there's no tidy bow,
*  but there is one little bow I'd like to tie at the end of this episode, which is, you know, the two
*  founders or battlers for two different schools of thought, who are these two best friends who end up
*  being the second and then third president of the United States, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson.
*  They, I mean, they break hideously ideologically and their friendship cleaves and there is so much
*  sort of muck that is raked between them. Mainly, I think it's fair to say Jefferson kicking muck at
*  Adams, but they maintain a friendship after they're both out of office and they maintain a
*  communication where they actually talk about this. What are we? What did we fight for? What does
*  America mean? Why did we do all this? What should we be? What is life, love? I mean, there's a
*  collection of extraordinary letters that pass between them and what I find, and if this is a
*  neat little bow, forgive me, and may sound twee, but it's the truth. 50 years after the declaration
*  of independence, the 4th of July, both men die on the same day, having communicated with each other.
*  On the 4th of July itself.
*  On the 4th of July, having held each other close and described each other as my soulmate and best
*  friend and having this dialogue right until the end of their lives. And I don't know whether this
*  is true or not, but it is Jefferson who dies first. And we're talking about hours apart.
*  And the last words that supposedly John Adams says on his deathbed are,
*  Thomas Jefferson, at least Jefferson survives. I don't know what you take from this, but these
*  are extraordinary men that we've spent time with, whether you like or love what they did,
*  created and thought. But it's a pretty fine full stop to this particular episode. Maya,
*  I don't know how we thank you. I mean, honestly, four episodes in a marathon. You're an absolute
*  hero. Thank you so much. We are so grateful.
*  All we can do is to send everybody to buy your book, which I cannot recommend highly enough.
*  Maya Jasnov's, Liberty's Exiles, on which these last four episodes have been loosely based.
*  Liberty's Exiles, The Loss of America and the Remaking of the British Empire is available
*  in paperback from Arpacolid. So till we meet again, it's goodbye from me,
*  Anita Arnand. And goodbye from me, William Dorenpo.
