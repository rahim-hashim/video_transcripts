Video Description: We're all about the Benjamins. Franklin is unquestionably the most well-rounded of the Founding Fathers. Not only did he help draft the Declaration of Independence and help America define itself, but he also discovered that electricity and lightning were one and the same, reformed the postal system, and proved you couldn't catch colds from swimming. Listen as William and Anita look at their last Founding Father and his incredible range of skills.

*  Hello and welcome to Empire with me Anita Arnone and me William Durimple.
*  And this is the last of our mini series on the founding fathers and we come to the one
*  who is definitely my favorite.
*  So I know that Anita still has a soft spot for John Adams.
*  I have a soft spot for John Adams, but I adore Benjamin Franklin.
*  Don't get me wrong.
*  I have room in my heart for two men.
*  It's all right.
*  Yeah.
*  Carry on.
*  Very good to hear Anita.
*  So the Ben Franklin is a different generation to all the others we've discussed.
*  He's already a man well past middle age when the American Revolution begins to loom into
*  the horizon and he's led enough lives in his different incarnations to do an entire
*  mini series on Benjamin Franklin alone.
*  He is an extraordinary scientist.
*  All that stuff with the lightning in many ways the man who realizes what the common
*  cold is a man who vets a musical instrument.
*  He's the first person to get onto lead poisoning.
*  Are you giving away your entire episode?
*  No, no, I'm just going through all those that I will continue.
*  He is also of course a diplomat an extraordinary inventor.
*  The most interesting about him to me is the way that having come as the founding father
*  that best knew Britain and who really genuinely loved London.
*  He's the one who decides in the end that America cannot continue as the colony of
*  Britain and he does it with a heavy heart and he does it knowing Britain as a place
*  that he's lived for about 18 years or something and had British lovers many British
*  friends known many of the most extraordinary men of the day the fathers of the Scottish
*  Enlightenment like David Hume.
*  He's visited by Boswell.
*  He's one of the most extraordinary men of his age and yet in late middle age he turns
*  into a revolutionary which is something that would surprise him.
*  Of all the founding fathers, he is the one who figures in rap music the most.
*  You know where you'll hear that phrase all about the Benjamins.
*  It's all about the Benjamins because he is the face of the hundred dollar bill.
*  So there we are.
*  That's what that's about.
*  So today we're all about Benjamins.
*  Very good.
*  For some reason we've been obsessing about the height of all these American founding fathers.
*  I don't think we should stop with Benjamin Franklin.
*  They were all tall.
*  None of them were shorties were they?
*  I mean how tall was Ben Franklin?
*  I think Ben Franklin was not a giant.
*  He was five foot nine.
*  How tall was your John Adams?
*  He's five foot seven.
*  So just slightly shorter than that I think.
*  The one who sort of struck people by his sort of masculine physicality was Washington.
*  Washington was the person that when he walked into Rome you noticed.
*  Although I keep saying Jefferson was taller.
*  His poor feet were pointing out when he was measured on Washington.
*  Yeah, but he was looking down a bit shyly.
*  Yeah, okay.
*  Okay.
*  Okay.
*  No, no.
*  All right.
*  I remember we've established that.
*  Anyway, look tell me about five foot nine Benjamin Franklin.
*  Tell me as a young man, let's do the origin story of Benjamin Franklin.
*  What was he like?
*  First of all, I think the thing to be said about Benjamin Franklin is of all of them.
*  He is definitely the man you would want to take to the pub for a drink.
*  He is affable.
*  He is humorous.
*  He has this lovely homespun wisdom that he liberally gives out not least in his almanac,
*  which is one of the things that he produces and how he makes his name.
*  And unlike the founding fathers who were slave-owning plantation men,
*  Franklin is very specifically middle-class.
*  He is an urban figure.
*  He calls himself Ben Franklin printer for most of his life.
*  He's a sort of nerdy inventor.
*  He's always coming up with better ways of doing things of inventing appliances
*  and improving things and studying the world around him.
*  He is very much a man of Boston.
*  He is born in Boston in Massachusetts on January 17th, 1706 and into a professional family.
*  Do you have the details of his parents there?
*  I do.
*  So he's basically of Northampton stock, if you want to go back to his father.
*  His father Josiah emigrated from Northamptonshire in 1682,
*  but his mother Abiah Abiah, I'm not sure how you say it,
*  the name A-B-I-A-H was from Nantucket in Massachusetts.
*  So, you know, his mother's family go back.
*  I love that name.
*  Nantucket.
*  Did you ever as a child have those Joe Nakin books,
*  the night birds of Nantucket?
*  No, but I know a really rude limerick with that in it.
*  But just not to be shed.
*  Tell me afterwards.
*  Tell you afterwards.
*  Okay.
*  I try to think of rude things that rhyme with Nantucket,
*  but I can't come up with any.
*  Oh my God.
*  People are, their thumbs are whirring away sending you the answer to that.
*  But anyhow, tell me what his parents wanted for their son.
*  So they thought he should join the church,
*  but he never showed the slightest interest in the church going.
*  And he's a noted rationalist from early on in his life.
*  And he is, one of his most famous things is scoring out the passages
*  that look to God in the Declaration of Independence
*  and changing it to an enlightenment declaration for reason.
*  The words self-evident about these truths are changed from sacred.
*  That's right.
*  He objected to the sacred and Jefferson says that, you know,
*  when Ben Franklin does do that, says I did think about all of these
*  words very carefully before I wrote them down and Ben Franklin,
*  who is charm personified, you know, sort of mollifies and saying,
*  yes, I know you did, but I just think this is better.
*  You know, it's sort of gorgeous.
*  Yeah.
*  And self-evident is exactly right.
*  It's a wonderful usage.
*  And then he does have this fantastic ability to write with wisdom,
*  with wit and very movingly.
*  I understand those parents weren't well off though.
*  They couldn't afford to send him to school for very long.
*  I mean, he's just a couple of years he went to school.
*  And his brilliance shows itself very early on in sort of practical
*  inventions. When he's 11, he invents swimming fins,
*  rather like divers use now.
*  He later writes, when I was a boy, I made two oval palettes,
*  about 10 inches long and six broad with a hole for a thumb in order to
*  retain it fast in the palm of my hand.
*  And they resembled a painter's palette.
*  In swimming, I pushed the edges of these forwards.
*  I struck the water with their flat surfaces as I drew them back.
*  I remember swimming faster by means of these palettes, but they
*  fatigued my wrists.
*  So he has this very observant, but also very sort of practical mind.
*  He's a man who finds himself very much at home when he apprentices
*  himself to his elder brother, James, as a printer.
*  And this is very much what his calling is for much of his life.
*  You had a great giggle at John Adams, Nom de Plume, when he was
*  writing his funny sort of dog-raw things in their pivot.
*  Hump-free plough jogger.
*  Yeah, but silence dog-good is not bad, is it?
*  Tell us about silence dog-good.
*  They have a very good version of this.
*  And yes, his brother founds the first independent newspaper in Boston,
*  the New England Courant or Courant.
*  Maybe Courant would be more New England than Courant.
*  Courant, I would have thought, yeah.
*  So Benjamin wants to write his brother's paper.
*  His elder brother, rather like my elder brother's, don't think
*  he'd be any good at it.
*  Stay in your lane, bro.
*  Stay in your lane, little brother.
*  Yeah.
*  So he writes onto the pseudonym silence do-good.
*  Not dog-wood.
*  I think it's do-good, isn't it?
*  As in do-gooder.
*  Oh, do-good.
*  Oh God, I thought it was dog-wood.
*  Okay.
*  Silence do-good.
*  Oh, well, that's less funny, but also very good.
*  Okay.
*  So he does do that, doesn't he?
*  And who is silence do-good meant to be?
*  Well, she's rather like kind of Lady Whistledown in Bridgerton.
*  She's this sort of elderly widow who is sort of witty, satirical.
*  And the readers of Boston fall in love with her so much that they
*  even get into the paper posing marriage.
*  Is his brother thrilled at this?
*  They have a tricky relationship, don't they, Ben Franklin and his brother?
*  Well, you know what elder brothers are like.
*  Benjamin describes that his brother treated him harshly, writing that
*  it might be a means of impressing me with that aversion to arbitrary
*  powers that has stuck to me through my whole life.
*  So it's his brother's bullying him that makes him upset with authority.
*  I mean, is it so bad that he just decides he can't be with him anymore
*  because he does have a huge change of circumstance at the age of 17,
*  doesn't he?
*  That's right.
*  Like many younger brothers before him, I choose my words carefully.
*  Did you run away to join the circus?
*  Why do you go to India?
*  India is quite far.
*  He finds that he can only be his own man when he's far away from being
*  the younger brother, so he goes off to Philadelphia, but he takes his skills
*  with him, so he starts off as a printer and a writer and a newspaper man.
*  But now age 17, he's in Philadelphia away from Boston.
*  I completely adore him.
*  I know you're right.
*  He's an interesting fella because again, 17, this point in life when
*  most people can't get their children out of bed, he's sort of thinking,
*  okay, I'm going to make my life in a new place and I'm going to make it
*  even better.
*  So he has his first trip to London not long after uprooting himself
*  and moving to Philadelphia.
*  Why does he go to London?
*  That's right.
*  And the excuse is to buy printing equipment for his Philadelphia newspaper.
*  And on arrival, the man who has promised to back him and buy the printing
*  equipment, which of course is very expensive, and he was certainly not
*  from a family that could have financed this itself.
*  He finds himself in London that his patron has disappeared or reneged
*  on all the promises.
*  And so he goes to work in a print shop using his skills.
*  He completely falls in love with London.
*  And I think this is very interesting because he's the only one of the
*  founding fathers that really knew Britain and who doesn't have this
*  sort of image of a distant place.
*  He lives there for great chunks of his life.
*  And what he loves best of all is the Samuel Johnson coffeehouse culture.
*  He's this is the age of Johnson and Boswell.
*  Boswell is his friend.
*  And England is very much the England of Hogarth Prince and Rawlinson
*  and all that sort of world.
*  He loves the coffeehouses.
*  He loves the intellectual discussion, but he's also very inspired by these
*  enlightenment ideas.
*  This pursuit of reason is something which very much appeals to him.
*  And he is not an educated man at this stage.
*  He's someone who's entirely self-taught and has not had the sort of
*  classical education that even Alexander Hamilton gets in New York,
*  although Hamilton came from an even more disadvantaged background.
*  But he learns on the hoof.
*  He's a reader.
*  There's these wonderful pictures of the young Franklin already with
*  spectacles, spent over books, studying away in his digs.
*  The other thing he loves doing is swimming.
*  We wouldn't advise him to do it at the moment given the state of British
*  rivers, thanks to our government, but he is keen on swimming in the Thames.
*  Do you know who used to swim in the Thames every day for years and years
*  and years before I knew him, but Bamberg Askoin, day in, day out.
*  Bamberg Askoin, my friend who does the Wallace collection, Xavier
*  Bray is a great tentative that comes to Adichisic with sort of floaties,
*  not to keep him afloat, but signal himself.
*  So look, he's swimming.
*  He's living his best life.
*  He's learning lots of things.
*  And one of the things he realizes at the time, the Thames is even colder
*  than it is now.
*  Remember, this is the period of just coming out of the little ice age
*  of the 17th century, and there are very, very hard frosts.
*  And sometimes the Thames freezes over and people are under the impression
*  that you catch a cold from swimming.
*  But he, one of his very first scientific discoveries is the idea
*  that it's spread by contagion.
*  At this point, there are no ideas of germs or viruses, but he understands
*  that it's something that's passed from person to person.
*  And he said, traveling in our severe winters, I've often suffered cold,
*  sometimes to the extremity, only short of freezing, but this did not
*  make me catch cold.
*  This he writes to the physician Benjamin Rush in 1773.
*  Isn't it interesting?
*  Because it's all about cold water plunges these days about hardening
*  or something.
*  I mean, that is the thing, you know, getting into an ice bar.
*  But he says very clearly in this letter, people often catch cold from
*  one another when shot up together in a close room.
*  And that seems like a small advance to us, but he's one of the first
*  to actually articulate this.
*  And what he says is the defense against this is fresh air and exercise.
*  And he argues that the best way to avoid a cold, even in the
*  midst of winter, is a measure of exercise.
*  And he says by degree of warmth it produces in the body, it gives
*  you a protection against getting a cold.
*  Yeah.
*  Anyway, that's my little medical bulletin from Ben Franklin.
*  No, no, I think it's really interesting.
*  This could be something that would be in a self-help book today,
*  two full living with two little exercises.
*  That's one of his pieces of work.
*  That's very him.
*  I mean, it is this sort of simple homespun wisdom that he comes up with.
*  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
*  But he not only sort of talks the talk, he walks the walk, he spins
*  the swim because he will be a swimming instructor late into his 70s.
*  He'll keep teaching people how to swim because he believes so
*  fervently in the benefits of it.
*  So he loved Britain.
*  How many times did he sort of go this way and that way between
*  the two countries?
*  So he has three phases in London.
*  He's always sailing backwards and forwards and he has this first
*  short run, I think 1723 to 1726.
*  He's back in the late 1750s, 1757 to 62.
*  And then there's the very formative and important 10 years between
*  1765 and 1775 when he is humiliated and turns against Britain with
*  very important results.
*  With ferocity.
*  Yeah.
*  So that's the first trip done and Franklin then returns to
*  Philadelphia in 1726 and by now he is only 21 years of age.
*  The aged Benjamin Franklin is 21.
*  He sets up a debate club because I mean, he's loved that coffeehouse
*  experience so much.
*  He wants something of the same.
*  What does he call it?
*  He has an identity for this new way.
*  Is it the Junto or the Junto?
*  I don't know how you pronounce it.
*  I don't know.
*  Let's say Junto and sound cleverer than we are and then someone
*  can correct us.
*  It's the same word as Junta.
*  Junta.
*  Yeah.
*  Well then Junto.
*  As in a South American power.
*  If it's helpful, it's also called the Leather Apron Club.
*  That might help.
*  And Leather Apron is exactly what Ben Franklin is all about.
*  He's very much in his print shop with his Leather Apron with the
*  other printers making things and what distinguishes him is he's
*  not just making things, he's chatting and questioning and looking
*  and examining.
*  Try to understand the whole time natural philosophy, which we
*  would call physics today.
*  All right.
*  Okay.
*  So, I mean, he's really set up a salon culture, but of men who
*  are good with their hands as well as with their brains.
*  I mean, that's the thing.
*  That's the company that he most adores is people who are thinky
*  but also makey.
*  He says, you know, the group can be formed of ingenious men, a
*  physician, a mathematician, a geographer, a natural
*  philosopher, a botanist, a chemist and a mathematician.
*  That's his dream sort of combination of people.
*  Brilliant.
*  And that they first must sort of dedicate themselves that they
*  are all interested in mutual improvement endeavors.
*  That's the whole edifice of this Hunter Club or the Leather
*  Apron Club is based on that.
*  And they also help create the first lending library in
*  Pennsylvania and the creation of the country's first volunteer
*  fire brigade.
*  I love this variety of different things he's involved in.
*  I love that the two go together, a library and a fire brigade,
*  of course.
*  There is already, of course, a library in Boston by this stage
*  where I have twice had the privilege of giving lectures.
*  The Boston library is attached.
*  Is it the Philosophical Society on Boston Green?
*  Maybe, maybe.
*  And it's in the building which would have been there at this
*  time.
*  Can I just ask, we would not mention, but Philadelphia was a
*  magnet for Quakers.
*  It was a really Quaker area and I was Ben Franklin, a Quaker,
*  or this kind of getting people together to try and improve
*  the lot of everybody.
*  It's a very Quaker-ish idea.
*  So, no, I don't think he is a Quaker.
*  He is an ally of the Quakers and he admires the Quakers for
*  their civic sense, but he is not a believer.
*  I think he's very much a man of reason and I don't think he
*  has any public expressions of religious faith, but there is
*  a point when, for example, he pushes through a bill to create
*  a force that is purely voluntary.
*  There's no compulsory joining of the militia which secures
*  the support of the Quakers and they're important political
*  allies of his later in life.
*  Well, they will be hugely important when we get to the
*  American Revolution episodes because for a long time they
*  are the ones digging their heels and saying we do not want
*  to go to war with England and Franklin is sort of caught
*  in between those.
*  But look, let's take a break here and after the break,
*  we'll talk about sort of the young man Franklin coming into
*  his own.
*  Welcome back.
*  So just before the break we were having sort of the young
*  Franklin, again, one of these unfathomably bright and capable
*  teenage boys who's forging his way in the world despite his
*  brother sort of telling him he's not really worth that much.
*  Despite the fact that he has only very basic education at
*  this stage.
*  Yeah, but a brain the size of a planet who wants to learn
*  things wants to keep filling it up.
*  We haven't talked about family and marriage because that is
*  a huge imperative, especially in colonial America where,
*  you know, everything is about the family and continuity.
*  It's strange from his brother and his, you know, his roots.
*  What does he do?
*  Does he get married?
*  Does he fall in love?
*  He marries Deborah Reed who in the picture of her in Walter
*  Isaacson's biography is a formidable looking character and
*  it has to be said that it's not a great marriage.
*  He is away from her for years when he goes to London for
*  whole decades.
*  She stays behind and Franklin who is no looker and has this
*  sort of bald head and straggly hair is nonetheless such an
*  engaging character that he is a surprising ladies man.
*  I mean he is what we would call these days a shagger.
*  He is a prolific shagger.
*  He is that we would indeed call him that there are pictures
*  there's one sketch in the biography by someone called
*  Charles Wilson Peel who makes a sketch after walking in on
*  Franklin kissing a girl possibly Polly Stevenson in
*  Craven Street.
*  There are other pictures in the biography of him being surrounded
*  by women in Enlightenment Paris.
*  Yeah, and he's the single plump not very well dressed balding
*  man that's surrounded by sort of Marie Antoinette ish ladies
*  in wigs and sort of ballooning dresses and he's looking as
*  if he's the only man in a room full of women in this picture
*  and he looks as if he's both enjoying it and encouraging it.
*  Of course he is of course he is because he does love the
*  society of women, but you know, he may not love his wife very
*  much, but he does have one first love to see not.
*  I mean, it's a poor Richard's almanac arguably is his first
*  great love isn't it?
*  And there's another wonderful picture of this in Walter
*  Isaacson's biography, which I have to say is again one of
*  the great biographies.
*  Do you mean this here biography here?
*  It's amazing.
*  That is the very one that you've got there.
*  That is the biography.
*  Yes, indeed.
*  Yeah.
*  And Walter Isaacson everyone knows is the man who sold sort
*  of a million copies of his biography of Steve Jobs and
*  therefore made every other biographer in the world hugely
*  jealous, but he wrote other great biographies of Kissinger
*  of Einstein and more improbably Leonardo da Vinci.
*  He likes these scientists, but anyway back to poor Richard's
*  almanac and poor Richard's almanac is as it says, it's
*  sort of an almanac which has among other things in the title
*  page of the very first edition wherein is contained the
*  lunations, eclipses and judgment of the weather, spring
*  tides, planet motions, aspects of the sun and moon rising
*  and setting, length of days, time of high water, fairs,
*  courts and observable days.
*  And then the front of it, it says an almanac for the year
*  of Christ 1733 being the first after the leap year, which
*  is the year 7241 by the count of the Eastern Greeks, the
*  year 6932 according to the Latin Church, and the 5682 by
*  Roman chronology and the year 5494 according to the Jewish
*  rabbis.
*  Blimey.
*  As well as having sort of all these calendars, poems,
*  astronomy, all of that kind of thing, we owe him so many
*  aphorisms, maxims they're called aren't they, the maxims of
*  Ben Franklin.
*  He not only liked to sort of create his own maxims, but he
*  liked to adapt maxims from other people.
*  So fasten your seat belt, going to rattle you through things
*  that are attributed to Ben Franklin.
*  Go for it.
*  Eat to live, not live to eat.
*  He that lies down with dogs shall rise up with fleas.
*  Where there's a marriage without love, there will be
*  love without marriage.
*  Necessity never made a good bargain.
*  They seem more old drunkards than old doctors.
*  Okay, that's not so well known.
*  What are the other ones?
*  Oh, fish and visitors stink in three days.
*  He that lives on hope dies farting.
*  Very 18th century.
*  Yes, I know, but it's sort of changed afterwards.
*  I think people said it's beneath you.
*  He said, oh right, he that lives on hope dies fasting, but
*  he meant farting.
*  Diligence is the mother of good luck.
*  Haste makes waste.
*  Make haste slowly.
*  So more haste, less speed.
*  I mean all of these things.
*  No gains without pains.
*  That's him as well.
*  Vice knows she's ugly.
*  So she puts on a mask.
*  That's another one.
*  Love your enemies for they will tell you your faults.
*  There is a time to wink as well as to see.
*  She's playful old Franklin and God helps those who help themselves.
*  Is that him?
*  That's him as well.
*  Goodness.
*  Isn't that great?
*  I love it.
*  In a sense, possibly the thing that we most often use, which
*  is a Franklin coining, is the terms positive and negative for
*  electricity.
*  Right.
*  Well, that's dead sciencey.
*  That's not a maxim.
*  That's a thing.
*  But it is a coinage of the same man who leaves school at 16.
*  I think they used to call it vitreous and resinous.
*  And he said, no, no, no, let's just make it positive and negative
*  plus and minus that will make more sense.
*  Electricity, which is one of the very first things which makes
*  his name as a scientist.
*  He's fascinated by lightning and there's that famous portrait
*  of himself with his key and kite experiment.
*  He wants to capture the electricity of lightning and he invents
*  his own lightning rod that is 8 or 10 feet long and has a
*  sharpened point at the end believing that it would attract
*  an electrical charge is struck by lightning and there's this
*  fabulous picture again.
*  Oh, I love this portrait of him.
*  It's very Prometheus actually, isn't it Prometheus holding
*  up fire kind of thing?
*  That's I think the reference.
*  Oh, right.
*  But he's sitting there and there's a sort of what would in
*  other contexts be a sort of baroque transfiguration of a
*  sky behind him and dark clouds lightning jagged and Franklin
*  with his bald pate and cravat is sitting in the middle of
*  this tempest with his lightning rod and his key which is to
*  pick up electricity which you thought was a risky experiment.
*  But anyway, he seems to have lived to tell the tale and to
*  prove the point.
*  Yeah, well, I mean, yeah, henceforth people put lightning
*  rods on top of buildings to attract the charge away from
*  people who might be electrocuted.
*  This picture is by our old friend Benjamin West who sort
*  of comes in and out of our pod every few months because he
*  also did the picture of Shalem gifting in inverted commas
*  the Dewani to Robert Clive, which is the central East India
*  Company picture, which is the often used to illustrate
*  anything you ever see about the East India Company and he
*  also something we'll probably be coming to eventually which
*  is he also painted the picture of the death of Wolf on the
*  heights of Abraham.
*  So he's a fascinating painter.
*  The thing is, you know, he's got a lot on his plate.
*  He's got his almanac.
*  He's got, you know, saving buildings from electrocution,
*  but that's not enough because in 1753 is appointed joint
*  postmaster general of North America.
*  So what does that mean?
*  And what does he do that?
*  So interesting.
*  Has two sort of effects on him.
*  First of all, being Franklin, of course, he reforms the
*  whole system prior to him.
*  It's difficult to imagine this being true, but apparently
*  it is if you were sending a letter from Charlestown to
*  New York, it would go via London.
*  It would go all the way back to London, change ships and
*  then go out to New York.
*  That's bloody stupid, isn't it?
*  Obviously not very sensitive.
*  You can see why if that was the sort of standard of
*  administration, you can see why the colonists in North
*  America were beginning to chafe under that sort of system.
*  But anyway, Franklin instantly reforms that and gets, you
*  know, a much more sensible system whereby ships going up
*  and down the coast delivering letters as you would imagine
*  it had been anyway, but apparently it wasn't.
*  At a deeper level, what this does is it puts Franklin up
*  and down the American coast himself.
*  He has to go and visit all 13 colonies, which as that
*  postal system indicated were often very disconnected
*  from each other.
*  We think of this now as one landmass.
*  They must have all been in each other's pockets going
*  backwards and forwards.
*  But that simply wasn't the case.
*  Many of the southern colonies with their plantation economies
*  were much more closely connected with places like Barbados
*  and the Caribbean than they were with each other.
*  And this is the moment that in Franklin's head, the conception
*  of 13 colonies all linked with each other, all together, all
*  forming one unit becomes something that he has personal
*  experience of and understands.
*  This is also the period when he comes up with his famous
*  cartoon of a snake or a serpent chopped up and in May 1754
*  having read George Washington's article about the military
*  loss to the French, Franklin publishes his famous political
*  cartoon in the Pennsylvania Gazette and it has this image
*  with the each section of the snake which is chopped up
*  labeled with the colonies initials above the simple words
*  join or die addressing the lack of unity between the colonies
*  something much much bigger than I think any of us imagine
*  it today.
*  And this is an image which will come back later in Franklin's
*  life and become a major slogan for the revolution.
*  I mean another part of the Albany and why it's important
*  the Albany plan is apart from you know saying look we have
*  to stick together or you know like a chopped up snake will
*  just die in the dirt is that he wants to get some kind of
*  combined response to the combined threat of the French
*  and Native Americans with instructions to ensure friendly
*  relations with the Iroquois in particular.
*  How does that go down?
*  So the Iroquois come up with a Confederacy and Franklin rather
*  than sort of looking at them as savages thinks you know,
*  this is a brilliant idea.
*  Why haven't we done it too?
*  So he comes up with this idea of a grand council made up of
*  representatives of each colonies assembly again something
*  which you would assume already existed.
*  We are so inured to the idea of America being a unit albeit
*  a federal one that we assume that they must have had some
*  sort of joint representation but of course they haven't they
*  were all founded separately in some ways in competition with
*  each other with sometimes is very different interests and
*  this council did not exist until Franklin dreamt it up and
*  people began to think in those terms and began to putting the
*  motion begins towards founding something like this.
*  Yeah, but initially Pennsylvania or the Pennsylvania
*  assembly and that's where all the seat of power lies and
*  where representatives from the colonies can meet together and
*  debate these things are what they want to sign up to they
*  don't like this plan and they kind of bat it away.
*  They kind of sort of send him off with his tail between his
*  legs.
*  How does he respond to that?
*  Well again, I mean this is this image that we have that this
*  should have been something that must have been there was a
*  natural order of things, but I don't think anyone saw it like
*  that at the time and certainly the Pennsylvania assembly
*  didn't.
*  Philadelphia you got to remember was one of the largest
*  towns this colony regarded itself as as one of the most
*  sophisticated they saw no particular reason why they
*  should be connected with that say Georgia, which was a par
*  venue colony a new establishment.
*  This is 20 years before the revolution, but Franklin is
*  already coming up with this sort of idea.
*  He's talking about unity, but he's not talking about
*  independence.
*  In fact, I mean it's fair to say isn't it William nobody's
*  talking about independence at this time, you know, you can
*  join the snake up, but you're not asking the snake to bite
*  it.
*  It's master if you like.
*  No, I mean one of the surprises is that even when you've got
*  the Boston Massacre and then the Boston Tea Party it doesn't
*  immediately cause people to think for independence.
*  The first reaction is to try and reform the system that's
*  already there to try and appeal to the King to try and reform
*  the way that the colonists are treated rather than the natural
*  immediate knee-jerk reaction that we want independence will
*  deal with this in a later episode, but it takes a whole
*  series of events and Paul Revere to change that so that
*  could be for next week.
*  I've got the horse right here.
*  His name is Paul Revere.
*  I mean, yes, Paul Revere, you know, the British are coming
*  the British are coming you'll hear more about that a bit
*  later on in this series.
*  All that exactly but Franklin travels to London in 1757 and
*  he spends quite a lot of time in London because what he
*  thinks is okay, you know what if I can't get everybody to
*  join together and they don't like my idea of this sort of
*  proto-federalism that I'm proposing at least we can get a
*  better deal from England and he wants to petition the King
*  to say look treat Pennsylvanians Virginians New Englanders
*  as equal to Englishmen because that's what we thought we
*  were and suddenly we're finding that we're not and you're
*  treating us differently.
*  He has two completely separate periods in London.
*  The first one is 1757 to 1762 then again 1765 to 1775.
*  So I mean, they're two long periods one of which is 10
*  years and he sets up with a girlfriend in London probably
*  he's certainly having relationships and he loves under
*  this is the important point he thrilled by the enlightenment
*  he's going off to visit some of the main characters in
*  Scotland Lord Cames is hanging out with people like both
*  well, he's at the center of things and in a sense that
*  sensation that Brits get today when they go to New York and
*  suddenly, you know, they arrive at a party and everyone is
*  there.
*  This is what he gets when he comes to London in the 18th
*  century.
*  No, London is big lights, you know big city for him isn't
*  it?
*  Yeah, yeah, London is the big city.
*  Absolutely.
*  And all the famous people all the writers who've written all
*  the articles he's read in journals all the philosophical
*  tracks that he's studying the ideas enlightenment these
*  people are living in London and in Scotland and he's
*  visiting them and he's very thrilled but it's in London
*  that this crucial event takes place that changes his
*  attitudes and he is connected with his job as the postmaster
*  there's a long and complicated story, which I don't think
*  we need to go into about why this happens, but he takes
*  some letters and publishes them and initially doesn't let
*  on that it's he that's done it but when someone who is
*  accused of the leak has to fight a duel Franklin honorably
*  comes forward and claims responsibility for this leak and
*  he's called before the Privy Council in a room called the
*  cockpit.
*  Now it's called the cockpit.
*  It's not a metaphorical usage.
*  It's a very literal usage in that it was the room in which
*  Cox fought during the reign of Henry the eighth, but it's
*  not a bad but it's not actually a bad usage because in
*  the Privy Council he summoned for the leak and he is accused
*  of dereliction of duty as postmaster general and he gets
*  a particularly nasty treatment at the hands of an ambitious
*  young prosecutor the Solicitor General Scotsman called
*  Alexander Wedderburn who accuses him of a whole variety of
*  horrors and there is a public gallery here and he is jeered
*  at the people cheer the prosecutor who's having great
*  fun advancing his career at the expense of Franklin and
*  according to his biographers he goes in a Brit and comes
*  out an American.
*  He's so badly treated.
*  He's so humiliated by what happens to him that it changes
*  his whole attitudes to the colonies.
*  Yeah, and by the time he leaves London in 1775 his attitudes
*  about being an American his feeling of being treated like
*  a provincial like someone who is a second-class citizen has
*  been enormously enhanced and embittered actually by this
*  experience with the Privy Council and he really genuinely
*  is a changed man from this point.
*  He still loves his friends in London.
*  He still regards it as a place which is place where you have
*  most fun in the world.
*  But as far as its political system is concerned his attitudes
*  now have become very very dark and privately doesn't do
*  anything publicly at this point, but privately also he has
*  a very very dim view of George III, which is something which
*  will grow in his letters and in his rhetoric, but only become
*  public many years later.
*  I mean you're setting us up beautifully for the man who will
*  be one of the founding fathers.
*  Do, if not, he doesn't ever become president of the United
*  States unlike the other founding fathers that we're talking
*  about.
*  I think only because he's so old unlike the others we've been
*  discussing is in his 70s by now.
*  He's born in 1706.
*  So by the time that he leaves London in 1775 he is 69 years
*  old.
*  Tell me his whole family doesn't follow his change of
*  heart though, do they?
*  I mean he has a son who believes something very different to
*  him and that's going to become a real wedge in a family, in a
*  Franklin family.
*  Correct.
*  His son William Franklin who he has never got on with and in
*  truth there's already a rift between them.
*  I mean, I don't think you know he's by any sense an ideal
*  family man.
*  He's a philanderer.
*  He's a philanderer.
*  I mean he's charming and he's lovely but he is a philanderer.
*  Yeah, he's a great philanderer and pictures even by the 18th
*  century was a period of notably flexible moral systems.
*  And even by those standards he is regarded as a bit of a
*  ladies man, which is a strange thing because he's not a looker
*  by any stretch of the imagination.
*  Nobody's charming.
*  He's charming and clever.
*  He is charming and he's a scientist.
*  Not everybody Anita goes for men who have collections of
*  Enigma machines.
*  I thought every girl liked scientists.
*  All right, that's just me then.
*  All right, but his son doesn't like the way he's putting it
*  about because it is I mean every time he does it.
*  It's an insult to his wife who hasn't traveled to London with
*  him and who is just at home is it?
*  Well, I'm not sure how much his family know, but certainly
*  he and his son already do not get on and they get on worse
*  as the political divide grows as he becomes more estranged
*  from his ties with London and with Britain his rift with his
*  son William grows at the same time.
*  And so it's a difficult time for him, but it changes in many
*  ways the history of America.
*  It does indeed and a rift in a family is the bedrock of what
*  becomes the American Revolution because you will see families
*  split apart not on the issue of the conduct of their very very
*  charming scientist fathers, but on the issue of who to you
*  owe your loyalty to do you owe it to the king or your colony?
*  It leaves us in a brilliant position till the next time we
*  meet it is goodbye from me Anita Arnon.
*  And goodbye from me William Dremple.
