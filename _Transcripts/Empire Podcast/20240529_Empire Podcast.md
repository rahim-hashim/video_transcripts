*  Hello and welcome to Empire with me, Anita Arnone.
*  And me, William Durample.
*  Hey William, I've got a question.
*  How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a Scotsman dropped in the middle of a
*  forgotten spot in the Caribbean by Providence impoverished and squalor grow up to be a hero
*  and a scholar?
*  How indeed.
*  I've never heard you rap before.
*  Forgive me.
*  That made silence.
*  I didn't know that was coming.
*  Internationally, the sound of hands slapping against forehead.
*  What is she doing?
*  Someone make her stop.
*  Don't go, Anita.
*  Please stop.
*  But we are here.
*  You're better on the BBC than on stage.
*  We are here to talk about the $10 founding father without a father.
*  I'm going to stop quoting Alexander Hamilton, the musical in a second, but I really, really,
*  really, really, really loved it.
*  So we're here to talk about Hamilton.
*  Yes.
*  It's an odd one because of that musical.
*  You could argue he's actually now the best known of all the founding fathers.
*  He's the only one that certainly anyone would produce a rap song straight out on.
*  But the reason that Ron Chernow wrote the biography that inspired the musical was that
*  he was the least known and least celebrated and most obscure of the founding fathers.
*  And that while there were bookshelves full of books on Benjamin Franklin and George Washington,
*  there was absolutely nothing about Alexander Hamilton.
*  And indeed, that the end of his life and the duel and all the political shenanigans that
*  went on at that period led many to have a negative view of him.
*  We forget this now, but Chernow's biography was written to overturn a whole set of very
*  substantial prejudices against Hamilton.
*  So yes, he's come a long way in a decade, I think it's fair to say.
*  And the view we have of Hamilton today is quite different from what anyone would have
*  thought 20 or 30 years ago.
*  Chernow has completely changed the view in scholarly circles and the musical and all
*  the songs and sellout shows have changed his view on a popular front.
*  His name is Alexander Hamilton.
*  Look, we are unashamedly going to lean on the Ron Chernow book, just as Lin-Manuel Miranda
*  did, because it is an extraordinary deep dive into a life.
*  And in it, Chernow says, look, this is a man.
*  Why don't you know him better?
*  We do now. Thanks, Ron.
*  But, you know, this is a founding father who gave the world or gave certainly America the
*  central bank, the financial system, an independent judiciary, a professional army.
*  He has a lot of accolades.
*  And at the time, Chernow didn't have the recognition of it.
*  And I suppose he was a baby when he was doing all these things, which is a baby.
*  So we want to know his origin story, Willie, and that's what you're here to tell us today.
*  Yes. And I think it's very, again, it's slightly different from what you might have guessed,
*  even if you saw the musical.
*  I mean, certainly all my kids left imagining that Alexander Hamilton was black or at least
*  half black. I don't think he was.
*  I think the balance of scholarly opinion is that he was basically Scottish, certainly
*  from his father's side.
*  Well, I mean, it's John Adams who hated him, who called him a mulatto bastard and things
*  along those lines.
*  I mean, he would that was certainly.
*  But I think that largely because he was from St. Kitts, really, because he was from the
*  Caribbean.
*  But you're right.
*  I mean, the bloodline thing, I was first thing I went to look up.
*  So tell us who his mum and dad were.
*  So his mother, Rachel Forsett, is actually quite wealthy.
*  She inherits an estate, which is why the near-Duel father, James Hamilton, marries
*  her. Now, Hamilton is not an uncommon name in Scotland.
*  And in fact, I don't know if I ever fessed up to you, Anita, but Hamilton is actually
*  part of my surname.
*  I was born Hamilton Durample, though I don't use that.
*  His name is Hamilton Durample.
*  It certainly scans, even if it doesn't write.
*  It's hard.
*  Yeah. So Alexander Hamilton's father was the fourth son, though, of this man, James Hamilton.
*  The Scottish Laird.
*  That's right.
*  And so he's a classic Scottish-led younger son.
*  But then you don't really get much as the fourth, do you?
*  I mean, everything goes to the first.
*  In my case, you got nothing at all.
*  So what do you get?
*  What does the lucky winner?
*  No, you don't get anything.
*  And that historically has always been one of the sort of propellants of Scottish Empire.
*  And you get sent abroad, which is why the whole of Indian colonial history and a lot
*  of the history of the Caribbean involves younger sons of Scots Lairds.
*  And Ayrshire is exactly the kind of area where this was the norm because it's particularly
*  poor countryside.
*  It's one of the poorest areas in Scotland today.
*  And when you go around Ayrshire, you have all these names.
*  I was there last weekend on a beautiful summer day with Tom Holland of our sister pub, Restless
*  History, for something called the Boswell Festival.
*  Boswell being another contemporary of Alexander Hamilton from Ayrshire at exactly this time.
*  And as you drive through this countryside, there's all these Indian names.
*  I drove through a place called Patna.
*  Patna?
*  Really?
*  Patna!
*  Really?
*  That's hilarious.
*  Oh, God, that's funny.
*  And in my book, The Anarchy, there was this character called William Fullerton, who was
*  from Ayrshire, who's one of the only survivors of the Patna massacre, the other Patna.
*  Robbie Burns was from Ayrshire, and he very nearly went off to the Caribbean and famously
*  at the last minute decided not to get involved in that whole world of slave plantations and
*  all the horrors attendant there.
*  Which is why we quote him every year.
*  Which is why we quote him exactly.
*  With haggis and whiskey.
*  But James Hamilton did.
*  I mean, so he goes off to try and seek his fortune, and fortune appears to him in the
*  16-year-old bundle of Rachel Fauset, who is an heiress after her father dies.
*  Contrary to the impression that might have been given by the lyrics you quoted, she wasn't
*  a whore at all.
*  She inherited a healthy estate, which is why she attracted James Hamilton, who is a
*  kind of near-do-well Scots younger son.
*  And she starts her life in a tiny, tiny Caribbean island called Sainte Croix, which is a Danish
*  colony.
*  The Danes are among the many who have got claims to land in the Caribbean, and just
*  as they have two little colonies in India, including Trangabar, they also have this island.
*  And there she has a very unhappy marriage, which she flees, leaving her husband.
*  Well, her husband's really abusive, isn't he?
*  The first husband.
*  He imprisons her.
*  He doesn't treat her well.
*  It must have been really, really bad for a woman to leave a man and leave a marriage.
*  It's a big, big deal, especially at that age.
*  Exactly.
*  We should say again, completely clearly, she's neither a prostitute, nor is she half-black.
*  There are rumors about this, but there's actually no clear basis for stating that beyond people
*  trying to dis Hamilton later in life.
*  And she flees from Sainte Croix to St. Kitts, which is another tiny island, but this time
*  it's a British island.
*  There she comes across this slightly hopeless character.
*  The fourth son, Hamilton.
*  Called James Hamilton.
*  Ah, right, right, right, right.
*  Despite his grand ancestry, his father was Lerde the Gringe, who is from a whole network
*  of slave-owning and mercantile families on the west coast of Scotland, who are trading
*  with the Caribbean and the New World.
*  James Hamilton himself seems to make nothing of his fortune, and his son, Alexander Hamilton,
*  who barely remembers him, speaks about him almost with pity.
*  He regards him as a hopeless embarrassment.
*  But his mum, Rachel, is feisty, and after James Hamilton disappears and basically abandons
*  the family, the two boys from the relationship are brought up by their mother in a sort of
*  first-floor flat above a shop.
*  It's a really, really unpromising birth.
*  But it's a place of books and writing and music because she is cultured and she's, you
*  know, unlike the fourth son, Hamilton, she does have intelligence and wit and cleverness.
*  She has smarts, so she teaches his boys, doesn't she?
*  Yes, but I don't think she has, I mean, she has a few books.
*  I think that maybe that is the spark that sets Alexander off.
*  You just need something to set you apart from what is otherwise a hopeless trajectory.
*  But this idea of him being a bastard, orphan son, I mean, the thing is she's not able to
*  get a divorce from her first husband.
*  He won't grant the divorce.
*  So when she has these two children with Hamilton, they are deemed to be illegitimate because
*  she hasn't secured this divorce.
*  So that puts a pay to that.
*  So she can't marry the hopeless Hamilton.
*  And then the hopeless Hamilton disappears.
*  So these kids are brought up on the smallest of small islands.
*  It's 10 kilometres by 20 kilometres.
*  It's really a very minor Caribbean island.
*  And at the time, the Caribbean is considered violent.
*  There are areas of culture like Haiti and Jamaica where there are libraries and philosophical
*  societies and good schools.
*  But St. Kitts is not one of those.
*  So Nevis, I mean, we will say St. Kitts and Nevis, Nevis is where he grew up.
*  But there is slavery all around him, isn't it?
*  Because this is a hub of sugar plantations.
*  Yes, it's overwhelmingly the population is enslaved Africans.
*  And it's not an island with any sort of libraries or serious educational institutions.
*  The extraordinary story is Alexander Hamilton's rise from this.
*  This is about as backwards as unintellectual and as restricting a childhood as you could
*  possibly have had.
*  And then his mother dies and he's an orphan.
*  One other thing about being in St. Kitts, Ron Chenow, who has written this amazing book,
*  startling me, he's such a good author.
*  It's incredible.
*  When I first arrived, thump on my doorstep last week, it is over 700 pages.
*  Well, it's like the Washington book.
*  I actually really enjoyed reading.
*  But Chenow describes St. Kitts and Nevis as a tropical hellhole of dissipated whites and
*  fractious slaves.
*  And it is interesting that he grows up with all of these.
*  These are his formative memories of childhood.
*  He is always a fierce opponent of slavery.
*  So if you want to know people's origin stories, that's really important.
*  And he stands apart.
*  John Adams is another who's an opponent of slavery, but more so Hamilton.
*  It's very interesting that because as we've seen from our previous podcast, both George
*  Washington and Thomas Jefferson are slave owners who do not treat their slaves very
*  well.
*  And Alexander Hamilton comes from a far poorer background, far more marginal situation from
*  a place that even by Caribbean standards is backwards.
*  And yet he is, of all the founding fathers, arguably the strongest opponent of slavery
*  and the one with the clearest moral position that to our eyes singles him out along with
*  John Adams.
*  Even more strongly than John Adams against the slave trade and against the enslavement
*  of human beings.
*  So let's go back to a little 11 year old, somewhere between 11 and 13.
*  I think there's some question mark over his actual date of birth.
*  But his mother has died of fever.
*  He would have had it.
*  His whole family would have rampaged.
*  The father's already buggered off somewhere else.
*  So what happens to him?
*  What has he got as this tiny teenage boy?
*  So while Alexander's mother is living, he does receive individual tutoring from a Jewish
*  headmistress.
*  There is a Jewish headmistress in this island and Alexander supplements his education with
*  a family library of 34 books.
*  But when she dies of fever in February 1768, it is a catastrophe for him.
*  And what estate she has is claimed by her son from her first marriage.
*  Hamilton loses almost everything.
*  A friend intervenes and saves the family books.
*  So the books are an essential sort of piece of salvage for this boy from his home.
*  It's almost all that he has after it.
*  Yeah, I mean, you get the impression that he was a well thought of young man and that
*  the neighbors do at times of huge crisis do club together for him.
*  So whoever this benefactor is who gives the books and sends them back, it will be those
*  around him who have no blood relation to him who will step in a couple of times in his
*  very solid days to help him out.
*  But the horrors are not over because he's taken in by a fairly distant cousin, Peter
*  Lytton, who's on the island.
*  But the following year, July 1769, Lytton takes his own life.
*  So this boy's lost his father has buggered off, as you put it.
*  His his mom has died of a fever and his benefactor and cousin, Peter Lytton, has hung himself.
*  And for a while, Alexander is given a home by a local merchant called Thomas Stevens
*  and apprenticed as a local carpenter.
*  It's a catastrophic childhood.
*  And just imagine the trauma.
*  I mean, we talk about trauma a lot these days, you know, having that many losses.
*  Nobody talked about trauma in those days.
*  They just kind of banged on through life and tried to get on because there was no other
*  choice. Either you do that or you die.
*  Look, let's take a break here.
*  When we come back, we'll discuss him coming to America.
*  Welcome back.
*  So just before the break, we were leaving poor little skinny Alexander Hamilton, who's
*  just a teenager, 13 years of age, on his own, again and again reminded of the fragility
*  of his life and the stability of his life.
*  So what happens after his guardian has taken his life?
*  What becomes of little Alexander then?
*  So we left him just apprentice to a local carpenter, which is not the natural career
*  path for someone who ended up as a founding father of what is now the most powerful nation
*  on earth.
*  But at some point, because his mother has made the point of educating him and this Jewish
*  school mistress has obviously done a good book, he is literate and he's good at his
*  lessons.
*  And somehow he manages to make the transition from just being an apprentice carpenter to
*  becoming a clerk at a local import export firm.
*  Is this Beekman and Kruger?
*  Beekman and Kruger, exactly that.
*  Oh, yeah. Right, right, right.
*  Which trades with the province of New York and New England?
*  So when we say trade, it's all sorts of things that are made in the Caribbean that are needed.
*  So timber, bread, flour, pork, beef, fish, black-eyed peas, corn, porter cider.
*  I mean, it's a long list of things going back and forth through the good offices of
*  Beekman and Kruger.
*  I can't imagine all of those came from, say, kits, presumably from around the region.
*  No, but stuff going back, you know, back and forth.
*  It's trade, isn't it?
*  So.
*  And this is the great trade collections that New York and so on are linked to these very
*  big Caribbean economies.
*  You've got to remember that at this point, Jamaica has a larger economy than all the
*  13 colonies put together.
*  I think that's right.
*  So while he is working as a clerk in this import export firm, he distinguishes himself
*  with his writing as well as being able to do accountancy and filling in the ledgers.
*  He writes poetry and prose.
*  He's a romantic and he has an incredible work ethic.
*  Is that before or after?
*  Because in the musical, I remember the hurricane, which just completely blows again.
*  He's just getting on his feet.
*  Things are just starting to look like subsistence level existence is possible for him.
*  And then this hurricane tears through the Caribbean.
*  It's the worst in living memory.
*  Trees are thrown at houses.
*  They're smashed to pieces.
*  It's proper carnage.
*  There would have been also a 15 foot high tsunami on the island.
*  So it was utterly disastrous.
*  But it's at this point that he pens this anonymous essay in the paper.
*  Did he write his way out?
*  He writes his way out.
*  And it is so extraordinary.
*  This essay in the local paper catches the attention of the whole island and in some
*  of the mainland colonies to such an extent that a fund is set up to send him to the mainland
*  for education.
*  I mean, it's an extraordinary break for this child that's had this terrible series of
*  catastrophes.
*  So towards the end of 1773, he catches ship and sets sail for Boston.
*  And there he reinvents himself, as we saw in the musical.
*  I mean, can we just for a moment, this young creature is unstoppable.
*  He has taught himself.
*  He has got up.
*  He's got through more tragedies than most of us will have in three lifetimes.
*  By the time he's 20.
*  So he washes up in America.
*  He's pretty tough, hardened, and yet has this romantic poetry writing soul as well.
*  He obviously had an extraordinary mother.
*  I mean, you can only interpret this as...
*  He's a pretty amazing guy.
*  What did he look like actually, actually?
*  Because he didn't look like Lin-Manuel Miranda.
*  And he didn't look like the wonderful actor I saw doing it in London.
*  What did the actual Hamilton look like in real life?
*  So no, he doesn't look at all like any of those.
*  He looks very much the sort of 18th century Scottish aristocrat by the time that he's
*  rich enough and successful enough to have his portrait painted.
*  He's a wee bit pasty.
*  Which is actually pretty soon.
*  It's a wee bit pasty if you don't mind me.
*  He is thin, unusually tall.
*  Cherno talks about his trim physique and debonair style.
*  And yeah, by the time that he has his first portrait painted, first full length,
*  he's wearing breeches, a waist skirt.
*  He is notably sort of fair skinned, blue eyed, and I think blonde.
*  So it's a very different picture.
*  I'm all for colorblind casting on the stage.
*  But that doesn't give an accurate image of what the man actually looked like at all.
*  Okay. But he fits in.
*  The musical has him sort of rubbing people up the wrong way almost as soon as he lands.
*  But he gets on.
*  He's got charm, doesn't he?
*  And he starts making connections.
*  He's witty.
*  He's charismatic.
*  And he's a bit of a genius.
*  He's recognized from the beginning for his scholarly ability.
*  And he makes it to what's then called King's College, which is the ancestor of Columbia.
*  Right. Okay.
*  In New York.
*  So this is in New York.
*  Right.
*  A good school.
*  He's 18 years old at this time.
*  Gosh, he's 18.
*  He's basically A-level age and he's managed to get himself out.
*  And so he's learning the things that King's College would have taught him.
*  I mean, things that all of the founding fathers were kind of discovering for themselves.
*  The enlightenment, philosophy, classics, mathematics.
*  But more importantly, he starts meeting important people as well, doesn't he, around this time?
*  He does.
*  And I think King's College New York is the premier educational institution.
*  He is getting the best education that you could get.
*  So he's gone from the least possible favored beginning to what is to this day,
*  the greatest springboard in New York.
*  And he's got the charm and the looks.
*  But that kind of is it as far as Alexander's Hamilton is concerned before the revolution
*  breaks out because he is very much unlike Franklin, who has a whole life before the
*  revolution and who has enough achievements to fill many volumes on his pre-revolutionary life.
*  Hamilton is the youngest and the one who, in a sense, is most created by the revolution.
*  And he is very clearly ready for it when he arrives in New York.
*  He's already starting to pen anti-British essays.
*  We have at the moment a revolution going on in Columbia University with all the protests
*  there. And you can imagine Alexander Hamilton very much in that mold and of that now.
*  Well, I'll leave you with these words.
*  In New York, you can be a new man.
*  In New York, you can be a new man.
*  Just you wait.
*  Look, we're going to tell you about this newly created Alexander Hamilton of legend now,
*  who is forged in the fire, as William says, of revolution.
*  That will come up in our American Revolution series.
*  But we have some more founding fathers to gallop you through this week.
*  Our next founding father could not be sort of more different, if you like.
*  You've got the sort of firecracker, lithe, skinny little boy.
*  You're going to have someone a much more solid presence in John Adams,
*  but no less fascinating.
*  And you can hear that right now if you join the club or you can sign on at
*  EmpirePodUK.com and hear it straight away.
*  So, till then, it's goodbye from me, Anita Arnith.
*  And goodbye from me, William Dorempel.
