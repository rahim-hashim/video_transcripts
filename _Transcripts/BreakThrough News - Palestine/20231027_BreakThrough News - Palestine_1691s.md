*  of this relentless bombing campaign by the Israelis [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=37.4s)]
*  and the electricity has been shut off [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=39.6s)]
*  in most of the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=44.1s)]

*  and they are bombing relentlessly. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=49.2s)]
*  Can you update us on the situation in Gaza [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=50.8s)]
*  after this extraordinary, gruesome siege [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=54.4s)]
*  that we've seen placed on Gaza by the Israelis? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=58.9s)]

*  It's the worst ever, in fact. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=69.7s)]
*  Right now we are talking about [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=72.3s)]
*  there is no electricity at all across the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=74.5s)]
*  There is no drinking water. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=77.9s)]
*  The people who started to drink from the salty water [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=79.7s)]
*  and of course this affects their health so much. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=84.5s)]
*  So many of them right now are sick [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=87.7s)]
*  because of drinking the salty water. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=91.89999999999999s)]
*  And now we are talking about hundreds of families, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=95.3s)]
*  in fact, got their homes bombed. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=99.8s)]
*  Not only their homes, but they put homes [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=102.9s)]
*  and they flattened their homes [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=106.1s)]
*  while some of them were sleeping [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=108.0s)]
*  and just, you know, they were just in their homes. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=111.9s)]
*  And then they bombed them [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=116.7s)]
*  and leveled their houses to the ground. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=118.5s)]
*  And here we are talking about more than 7,000 Palestinians [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=121.10000000000001s)]
*  are, have been murdered during this, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=126.10000000000001s)]

*  And we have nearly 1,900 Palestinian kids also. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=132.0s)]
*  They have been murdered during these airstrikes. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=138.0s)]
*  And also we are talking about [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=142.0s)]
*  nearly 2,000 Palestinians are still trapped. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=145.6s)]
*  They are missing under the rubbles. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=151.6s)]
*  And really the rescuing operation [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=153.8s)]
*  is really so difficult here in Gaza [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=158.2s)]
*  because of the lack of the fuel, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=160.8s)]
*  because of this affect the work of the vehicles [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=165.8s)]
*  that help to rescue those who are under the rubbles. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=170.5s)]
*  And in fact, also because they have just like, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=178.4s)]
*  you know, like simple machines [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=182.4s)]
*  and not all of them are used internationally [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=185.3s)]
*  for pulling out the people from under rubbles. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=190.70000000000002s)]
*  So they are trying so hard. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=194.7s)]

*  they are trying so hard in order to help those [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=199.1s)]
*  who are stuck under the rubbles. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=203.39999999999998s)]
*  We don't know maybe they are dead, they are alive. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=205.29999999999998s)]
*  No one knows. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=207.89999999999998s)]
*  Some kids, they were just under the rubbles [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=208.7s)]
*  for like many hours. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=211.5s)]
*  And now just today, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=213.0s)]
*  we pulled out two kids out of the rubbles. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=215.1s)]
*  They spent nearly, one of them spent six hours [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=218.39999999999998s)]
*  and the other spent like 10 hours under the rubbles. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=222.79999999999998s)]
*  And in fact, they managed to pull them out [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=226.29999999999998s)]
*  over the rubbles of their destroyed homes. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=229.39999999999998s)]

*  And in fact, like the situation here, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=241.79999999999998s)]
*  I'm just telling you that the Israeli occupation warplanes, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=245.1s)]

*  You know that they targeted just this, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=259.7s)]
*  we have nearly more than 20 Palestinian journalists. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=263.59999999999997s)]
*  They have been murdered while they were, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=267.8s)]
*  some of them, they were in their homes. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=270.7s)]

*  along with their families. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=274.4s)]
*  Like what happened with Doha Sharif, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=278.1s)]
*  she is a Palestinian journalist with her, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=280.3s)]
*  she fled her home from the north to the south, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=283.5s)]
*  you know, just seeking a safe refuge [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=288.3s)]
*  for her and her little child. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=292.5s)]
*  And just yesterday, we hear the news [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=295.6s)]

*  And now also they are just targeting political analysis. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=310.5s)]
*  They are targeting doctors. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=314.9s)]
*  Now, you know that Dr. Kamal Khattab, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=316.7s)]
*  he is a doctor, he is the manager of Shuhada al-Aqsa Hospital. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=319.09999999999997s)]
*  They targeted his home, killing his wife [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=324.59999999999997s)]
*  and all of his sons and daughters. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=327.29999999999995s)]
*  And he is critically injured so far. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=330.4s)]
*  And also other doctors, they were, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=333.9s)]
*  they targeted them in fact and sadly, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=336.4s)]
*  some of them received the news of their slain families [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=341.09999999999997s)]
*  while they are working on the hospitals. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=345.7s)]

*  despite the news of having all of their family members [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=355.29999999999995s)]
*  murdered during the Israeli airstrikes. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=360.0s)]

*  No, no, I was just gonna ask you, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=368.3s)]
*  I mean, is it believed that this is like intentional [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=369.7s)]
*  that the Israelis are intentionally targeting [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=372.4s)]
*  the families of medical professionals [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=374.4s)]
*  and media professionals? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=377.6s)]
*  I did see that in the Israeli media, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=379.8s)]
*  there was a commentator who actually said [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=383.1s)]
*  that the family of the Al Jazeera correspondent [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=385.7s)]
*  was killed deliberately by the Israelis. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=389.1s)]
*  Yeah, in fact, this is really, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=395.3s)]
*  it is so clear that they are targeting the civilian homes [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=399.1s)]
*  and the residential buildings and the homes. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=402.4s)]
*  And in fact, many times of their officials, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=405.6s)]
*  they said it clearly and even on the media, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=408.7s)]
*  they declared it clearly that we are targeting civilians. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=411.6s)]
*  And for, you know, we know that sometimes [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=415.7s)]

*  he said it that we are dealing with human animals, you know? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=459.5s)]
*  So they just dehumanize us as Palestinians. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=463.3s)]

*  and they killed some members of their families. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=478.6s)]
*  Just talking here about that Dr. Adnan Abu-Amar [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=483.3s)]
*  is a political analyst. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=486.6s)]
*  They targeted his home, killing his grandson [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=488.1s)]
*  and his son and their daughter. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=491.40000000000003s)]
*  And also targeted the founder [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=493.70000000000005s)]
*  of the Great Return March home, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=496.40000000000003s)]
*  killing his stepmother and his son, his two brothers [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=499.40000000000003s)]
*  and he was critically injured along with his other son. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=503.3s)]
*  You know, so it's so clear. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=508.3s)]
*  And I'm just telling you just two events here. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=510.40000000000003s)]
*  Like for example, they are just, you know, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=514.0s)]
*  threatening the people to move from the North to the South. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=517.4s)]
*  And in fact, like they committed so many massacres [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=521.4s)]
*  in the South, like in the North. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=524.3s)]
*  And here like, you know, that across the Gaza Strip, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=526.7s)]
*  the people, you know, we can like in around the clock, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=531.1s)]
*  we hear like massive explosions. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=534.1s)]
*  We hear like a Palestinian family got bombed [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=536.1s)]
*  and the family members got injured. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=540.0s)]
*  You know, that's why we have this big number of people [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=542.2s)]
*  who really got murdered by the Israeli airstrikes. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=546.6s)]
*  So they just target them without warning notice [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=553.2s)]
*  or without prior notice or anything else, you know? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=557.3s)]
*  So it's really big lies when they just keep saying [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=561.8s)]
*  that we are the, you know, targeting resistance fighters [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=567.0s)]
*  and so on. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=571.9s)]
*  And, you know, nearly I'm just telling you [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=572.74s)]
*  that like 90% or maybe like 99% of those, you know, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=575.0999999999999s)]
*  targets by the Israeli airstrikes are for just [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=582.6999999999999s)]
*  for the civilians. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=586.1s)]
*  They are just targeting civilians. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=588.1s)]
*  I know so many of the families in my town here [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=590.0s)]
*  that are not affiliated with any [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=593.2s)]
*  of the Palestinian factions at all, you know? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=595.9s)]
*  And they got their homes bombed and they got killed [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=598.9s)]
*  while they are in their homes. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=601.8000000000001s)]
*  You know, it's really, it's really, I mean, like look for, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=603.5s)]
*  for example, in the charge, you know, in the church, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=606.7s)]
*  they just targeted it like Christians and Muslims. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=609.9s)]
*  They were just, were there in the church [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=614.3s)]
*  and then they targeted it and killing [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=617.5s)]
*  at least 20 Palestinian Christians. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=620.1999999999999s)]
*  Two of them are Muslims. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=624.3s)]
*  You know, it's just, it's just, you know, like they say, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=626.5s)]
*  each time when they commit any mistake, they, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=630.5999999999999s)]
*  or it's not a mistake. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=633.5s)]
*  Whenever they, they hear like the international community, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=634.8s)]
*  I mean, like the international world, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=639.0s)]
*  when they, you know, condemn or deny their action, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=641.9s)]
*  they just say that just by mistake, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=646.5s)]
*  it's just a misfire or something like that. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=649.8s)]
*  But in fact, they mean, I just remember that to, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=652.8s)]
*  like the spokesperson of the Israeli army, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=656.0s)]
*  he said once that we know every bullet, where does it go? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=659.5s)]
*  You know, they know they have advanced weapons. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=664.5s)]
*  In fact, you know, they have advanced weapons. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=667.1999999999999s)]
*  And then of course they know they have warplanes everywhere. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=669.5s)]
*  They have drones, they have everything. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=674.0s)]
*  So they can just, you know, see everything on the ground [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=676.0s)]
*  and then they can target anywhere they want. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=681.4s)]
*  And in fact, like, you know, I'm just telling you [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=686.4s)]
*  that it's a war against the civilians here. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=690.2s)]
*  They just want to get revenge from the civilians here [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=693.1s)]
*  because they just wouldn't dare to face [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=697.0s)]
*  the Palestinian freedom fighters face to face. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=701.8s)]
*  So that's why they are just coming here and there. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=704.9s)]
*  And, you know, like massive, like many, many residential buildings [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=707.8s)]
*  across the Gaza Strip got bombed. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=712.5s)]
*  Just, you know, just they want to cause destruction [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=714.5s)]
*  as much as they can. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=717.2s)]
*  Wafa, let me ask you a question. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=719.1s)]
*  You're on the ground in Gaza. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=722.7s)]
*  Obviously this is happening all around you. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=724.5s)]
*  I can't even imagine the level of trauma [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=726.4s)]
*  that you and your family must be dealing with. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=729.3s)]
*  Can you give our audience an idea of what a day in your life [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=731.8s)]
*  is like right now under these current circumstances? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=736.4s)]
*  Yeah, like, you know, just I am a mother of three children [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=742.9s)]
*  and I have to deal with them like most of the time. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=747.0s)]
*  They keep asking me what is this sound? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=750.8s)]
*  And when this war is going to finish, we need to go to school. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=754.4s)]
*  Are we going to die? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=758.8s)]
*  Something like that, you know. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=759.8s)]
*  And, you know, like my eldest, my youngest daughter, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=761.3s)]
*  she told me once that, Mom, I had nightmares. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=765.0999999999999s)]
*  I had dreamt of something. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=769.8s)]
*  I told her what is it. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=771.5s)]
*  And then she told me I saw a ghost following me [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=772.5s)]
*  and I ran away like looking for you. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=777.5s)]
*  And it was so scary dream. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=782.0s)]
*  And then I know that she got traumatized [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=784.9s)]
*  of what she sees, you know, around there. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=787.9s)]
*  She just knew that and actually accidentally, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=791.0s)]
*  they heard me talking on the phone. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=794.9s)]
*  One of the relatives here in the end of our street here, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=798.3s)]
*  they hear the massive, you know, explosion [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=802.9s)]
*  and then they heard me talking on the phone with my relatives, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=805.6s)]
*  my other relatives. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=810.4s)]
*  They told me that the entire family got massacred. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=811.6999999999999s)]
*  He is my cousin and along with his wife, also his only son [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=815.6s)]
*  and his wife and three or four of his kids [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=823.1999999999999s)]
*  as well all got massacred in this massive bombing. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=829.1s)]
*  Only just four-year-old daughter and daughter-in-law [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=833.4s)]
*  and now she is with her, you know, grandmother [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=838.6s)]
*  from the side of her mother. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=842.7s)]
*  And it's really, you know, we just visited them this morning. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=845.2s)]
*  It's really horrible thing looking at this little child. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=849.1s)]
*  She got, you know, she got injured during this airstrike [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=852.5s)]
*  but still she kept asking about her sons, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=857.7s)]
*  about her brother and her two sisters, about her mother, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=862.8000000000001s)]
*  about her father. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=869.9000000000001s)]
*  You know, she told me that my mom went to make us a potato [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=872.2s)]
*  because I told her that really I like the fried potato [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=878.2s)]
*  and she went to do that and then I didn't see anything, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=881.9000000000001s)]
*  just I saw myself in the hospital. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=886.0s)]
*  It's really, you know, so scary thing to hear from such, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=889.6s)]
*  you know, little kids. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=893.3s)]
*  It's really very bad. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=897.4s)]
*  In fact, like, you know, we are exposed even we as adult, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=901.1s)]
*  we are exposed to so much horrible stories [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=906.6s)]
*  and it's like whatever I say about what is happening [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=911.8s)]
*  on the ground, I'm really sure I can't describe it. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=915.8s)]
*  I can't describe it exactly like what is happening here. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=918.9s)]
*  I'm just telling you like two days ago, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=924.9s)]
*  I went to the hospital and in fact, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=926.9s)]
*  the situation there is really horrible in fact. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=929.5s)]
*  Like I saw people, they were just laying on the ground. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=933.4s)]
*  You know, there's no spaces in the hospital. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=937.0s)]
*  So many displaced people, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=940.6999999999999s)]
*  they just take a refuge in the hospital. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=942.6999999999999s)]
*  They sit, they sat with their tents in the hospital yard [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=946.2s)]
*  and others who got injured, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=951.5s)]
*  they were just laying on the ground [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=953.8000000000001s)]
*  on the floor of the hospital, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=956.2s)]
*  just, you know, the nurses and the paramedics, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=957.8000000000001s)]
*  they just treated them while they are in the ground in fact. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=961.3000000000001s)]
*  And even they told me that so many of those who got injured, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=967.0s)]
*  in fact, they didn't, some of them were identified. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=972.5s)]
*  So because there is no fridge in the hospital, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=977.6s)]
*  no, even the ice cream trucks actually, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=984.2s)]
*  which they brought in order to, you know, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=988.2s)]
*  to freeze or to put the dead people in it. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=992.1s)]
*  Also it was filled, okay? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=996.9s)]
*  These trucks were filled. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=998.8s)]
*  So in fact, they started to bury the people, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1001.3s)]
*  the dead bodies, I mean, without even knowing their names, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1007.3s)]
*  but because they have no choice, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1011.5s)]
*  otherwise these dead bodies are going to root, you know? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1013.3s)]
*  It's, so they have, that's why they make like mass graves [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1019.4s)]
*  for those who got massacred. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1024.7s)]
*  And then they buried them in masses, in fact, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1029.3s)]
*  in these graves. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1033.6s)]
*  And you know, something else also, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1034.44s)]
*  there is no spaces in the graves, you know? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1036.3s)]
*  Actually it's something really horrible. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1038.5s)]
*  We just, we think here as maybe if we are going to die also, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1042.3s)]
*  are we going to find a space in any grave here around [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1047.6s)]
*  to be buried? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1052.3999999999999s)]
*  You know, it's something, I don't know, unimaginable. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1054.6s)]
*  It's just like fiction, you know? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1060.1000000000001s)]
*  It's really, when I ask people why, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1061.5s)]
*  if they buried my relatives in this grave, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1067.0s)]
*  they told me that there is no space in this grave. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1070.6000000000001s)]
*  So they searched for another grave in order to bury them. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1072.9s)]
*  And even they just told me maybe if there is another, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1077.3s)]
*  dead people who are not going to find any spaces for them. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1080.8s)]
*  So the situation is really so difficult [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1085.0s)]
*  if I keep describing it will be like. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1089.7s)]
*  I know, I can't even imagine, I know, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1092.9s)]
*  I can't even imagine the horrors and terror [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1095.4s)]
*  that you're dealing with. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1098.2s)]
*  And I just also wanted to ask you, I mean, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1099.3s)]
*  on top of everything you just described, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1102.0s)]
*  we talked earlier about how the Israelis [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1104.7s)]
*  refuse to allow food and medicine and water into the strip [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1107.7s)]
*  or even fuel to pump water. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1112.1000000000001s)]
*  I'm just curious, how are people accessing water to drink [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1113.9s)]
*  and food to eat at this point? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1117.7s)]
*  I mean, are people going without? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1119.8s)]
*  Actually, you know, the people like sometimes, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1124.5s)]
*  actually they go to the sea. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1127.8s)]
*  They started to use the sea water [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1130.2s)]
*  in order just to wash and maybe to do a pollution [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1134.5s)]
*  or something like that. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1138.7s)]
*  And sometimes some people, they have wells in their lands. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1140.2s)]
*  So they help the people to distribute water, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1146.0s)]
*  enough water for each one, you know, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1151.0s)]
*  just not a big amount, but at least just to do [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1153.2s)]
*  the basic needs in homes. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1158.2s)]
*  We don't do the, like for me, I just like [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1160.9s)]
*  since nearly a week or more, I didn't, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1164.2s)]
*  I couldn't in fact wash the clothes of my kids, you know, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1167.5s)]
*  and even our clothes. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1172.2s)]
*  It's really difficult because if I want to spend [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1174.0s)]
*  the water and just washing these things, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1176.4s)]
*  then I'm not going to find the, you know, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1180.4s)]
*  other for other basic stuff. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1184.3s)]
*  So like the situation, I mean, like this will help [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1188.6s)]
*  the people so much, but not in every place we can find this. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1193.2s)]
*  And when it comes actually, when they could bring water [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1198.4s)]
*  from these wells, actually just not enough for everyone. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1205.0s)]
*  Just everyone just maybe take like a few amount [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1209.7s)]
*  just for his family to survive just for a few days, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1214.7s)]
*  nothing more in fact. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1218.2s)]
*  But you know, I don't know like the people here, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1221.5s)]
*  I don't know sometimes, you know, that we feel that [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1227.4s)]
*  something like many things happen miraculously, you know, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1231.9s)]
*  like I told you that we don't have drinking water [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1237.2s)]
*  and they told us to just to use this dirty water [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1240.2s)]
*  and put like a silver on them. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1244.0s)]
*  And in order to be healthy or good to be used [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1247.2s)]
*  as a drinking water, some people use this, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1252.3000000000002s)]
*  but other people, they tried other ways in order to, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1255.7s)]
*  you know, to drink it from healthy ones. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1261.2s)]
*  And in fact, because like, you know, the fuel, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1264.9s)]
*  we still have a few only for 24 hours [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1269.5s)]
*  according to the owner, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1272.9s)]
*  where they just announced that only 24 hours [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1273.9s)]
*  and then the whole Gazistrip will be also run out of fuel. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1277.2s)]
*  We firstly, after they cut the electricity, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1281.9s)]
*  we depend on the fuel, but now, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1284.2s)]
*  so that's why we operate sometimes some machines [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1289.6000000000001s)]
*  and you know, we use them for drinking water. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1294.9s)]
*  And if we are talking here about after 24 hours, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1299.5s)]
*  if we don't have also fuel, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1303.8s)]
*  this means that we don't know what's going to happen. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1305.8s)]
*  In fact, but we do believe that the world, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1311.2s)]
*  inshallah will act and will stop this atrocity [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1315.6000000000001s)]
*  and this genocide from, you know, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1319.1000000000001s)]
*  from the, they will stop the occupation from keep [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1324.5s)]
*  committing the genocide against the Palestinians. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1327.5s)]
*  There's one last thing I want to ask you, Wafat, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1331.6000000000001s)]
*  and that is, you know, we hear from these Western politicians [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1333.6000000000001s)]
*  like Joe Biden or Silvander Lan, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1338.7s)]
*  I'm sure you've seen them repeatedly say [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1341.0s)]
*  that Palestinians deserve basic rights [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1343.6999999999998s)]
*  and that the problem is their leadership in Gaza. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1348.6s)]
*  The problem is Hamas, it's Hamas that's the problem, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1351.8s)]
*  as opposed to putting the blame on Israel [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1354.6999999999998s)]
*  and that they're actually helping Palestinians in Gaza [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1356.6s)]
*  get rid of Hamas. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1359.3s)]
*  How do you see people in Gaza actually, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1360.8s)]
*  you know, I know you can't speak for everybody there, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1365.8s)]
*  but when you see a statement like that [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1368.3s)]
*  versus how people actually feel on the ground, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1370.9s)]
*  you know, is that statement accurate? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1374.1000000000001s)]
*  Do you feel at all what you hear from Biden [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1376.8000000000002s)]
*  and Ursula von der Leyen? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1380.1000000000001s)]
*  Actually, it's like a big shame from this man [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1383.6000000000001s)]
*  to just declare something like that [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1386.7s)]
*  because he knows the truth and he knows that this army [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1389.3000000000002s)]
*  that they support and that's, they really fund from like, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1394.1000000000001s)]
*  I mean, they fund it from the Americans' taxpayer dollars, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1399.8999999999999s)]
*  we know that, and he knows the truth, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1406.5s)]
*  but he tried to, you know, to separate the group again [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1408.6999999999998s)]
*  that we are targeting Hamas, which is like ISIS and so on, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1413.0s)]
*  which is really completely wrong thing. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1417.6s)]
*  Actually, firstly, it's not Hamas, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1419.6s)]
*  the only one who is just attacking Israel. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1422.0s)]
*  We have other resistance factions here in Palestine [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1424.6999999999998s)]
*  and even here, I mean, like when we say that Hamas [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1427.9s)]
*  or other resistance factions, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1433.3000000000002s)]
*  they even got established after the occupation. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1434.9s)]
*  It's not before the occupation [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1438.3000000000002s)]
*  and they started like firstly peacefully protesting [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1440.1000000000001s)]
*  the Israeli brutality, but after that, in fact, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1443.7s)]
*  they started to use homemade weapons. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1449.3000000000002s)]
*  I know no one could bring them anything from outside, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1453.6000000000001s)]
*  so they depend on themselves [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1458.9s)]
*  because they are just armed with freedom. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1460.3s)]
*  They just seek for the freedom of their land. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1463.2s)]
*  They got, you know, they are defending their people [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1465.9s)]
*  and I'm really, I'm a journalist, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1469.8s)]
*  I'm telling you what I see in a daily basis [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1471.7s)]
*  here in Palestine. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1474.4s)]
*  Like recently, I started to talk to people [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1475.6000000000001s)]
*  who got their homes destroyed [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1478.0s)]
*  or who got their loved ones massacred [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1479.5s)]
*  during the Israeli airstrikes. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1482.5s)]
*  Many of them after saying that, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1484.8s)]
*  we lost, you know, I lost my family, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1488.0s)]
*  but they will never let us kneel. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1490.6s)]
*  We are not going to surrender. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1494.5s)]
*  This is our land, this is our homeland. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1496.3s)]
*  We are not leaving. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1498.7s)]
*  And even in some areas, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1500.1s)]
*  they were just random rallies. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1504.5s)]
*  In fact, they took the streets [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1508.2s)]
*  and they're asking the resistance [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1510.4s)]
*  to keep resisting this occupation. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1512.5s)]
*  And I mean, like so many videos, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1515.1000000000001s)]
*  I think it went viral. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1517.2s)]
*  These videos went viral for people [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1518.8s)]
*  who lost their entire families [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1521.6000000000001s)]
*  and they're just statements saying that [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1525.1000000000001s)]
*  we are supporting the resistance [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1529.4s)]
*  and we are asking the resistance to keep going. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1531.2s)]
*  We're not going to kneel. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1534.6000000000001s)]
*  We support them. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1536.4s)]
*  And they are the ones who protect us [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1538.1s)]
*  from the occupation of brutality and atrocity. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1543.6s)]
*  So, and really this thing is not from one person. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1546.6999999999998s)]
*  Like it is really from many, many people [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1551.1999999999998s)]
*  who got rid of people who got their homes [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1556.0s)]
*  or who lost their loved ones. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1558.1999999999998s)]
*  In fact, they stated this for the media. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1560.6s)]
*  And I hope that the international media [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1564.1999999999998s)]
*  can report many things that occur on the ground. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1567.9s)]
*  And in fact, they cannot, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1571.5s)]
*  I mean the international media, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1573.2s)]
*  they didn't report exactly what is happening here. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1575.1000000000001s)]
*  I mean, they just report, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1579.4s)]
*  like they report, yes, but not everything in fact. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1581.5s)]
*  I mean, the pro-Palestinian international media [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1584.9s)]
*  and for the ministry media, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1588.6000000000001s)]
*  well no, they are not going to report anything [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1590.4s)]
*  from the ground. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1593.2s)]
*  I mean, they are not going to report the truth [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1594.3000000000002s)]
*  from the ground. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1596.9s)]
*  We know that, but we need much effort to actually [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1598.2s)]
*  from the pro-Palestinian, from the pro-humanity in fact, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1601.9s)]
*  international media to talking about the truth, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1607.3000000000002s)]
*  to keep just, we don't want them to stand with us [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1612.8000000000002s)]
*  just to report exactly what is happening, you know, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1615.1000000000001s)]
*  just to report the truth from the ground. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1618.3000000000002s)]
*  Nothing more, you know, it's, we are not lying. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1621.0s)]
*  We have so many evidence on the ground. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1624.2s)]
*  We know that Israel is just committing many war crimes. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1626.6s)]
*  Firstly, they started by collective punishment. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1631.5s)]
*  They are targeting Palestinian homes. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1633.8s)]
*  They are using internationally banned weapons. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1635.8999999999999s)]
*  And everyone saw in the videos, the phosphorus bombs [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1641.1999999999998s)]
*  when they targeted like the Palestinian homes. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1645.1s)]
*  It's just, you know, they just attacking us [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1648.3s)]
*  by the US funded weapons in fact. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1652.1s)]
*  And then of course, many, many crimes were committed, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1655.5s)]
*  but still the ministry media and their supporters [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1660.3000000000002s)]
*  still do not believe that the truth [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1665.1000000000001s)]
*  and what is going on here exactly. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1668.1000000000001s)]
*  Well, Wafaa, I want to thank you for once again, joining me. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1672.4s)]

*  Thank you for joining me on the freedom side. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDNRvTtWj6A&t=1680.1000000000001s)]
