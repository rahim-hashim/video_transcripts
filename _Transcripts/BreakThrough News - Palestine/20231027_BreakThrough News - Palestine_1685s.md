# Leila Khaled Interview: Palestine is an International Liberation Struggle
**BreakThrough News - Palestine:** [October 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4)
*  The first mission was to hijack a plane and this I never heard about hijacking, never. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=0.0s)]
*  In our terminology we have struggled, we have fights, we have to be in prisons. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=7.44s)]
*  But this terminology was very new to my mind and okay when I was trained then PSLP from the beginning [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=16.72s)]
*  had a slogan, men and women are in the battle of liberation. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=27.84s)]
*  I'm Layla Khaled, I'm a Palestinian who is still a refugee since 75 years. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=41.040000000000006s)]
*  I'm a Central Committee of Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=48.88s)]
*  I'm based now in Jordan and that's it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=56.8s)]
*  First of all we haven't been divided. It's since the revolution and the intifada [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=67.36s)]
*  that happened in 87 but after Oslo of course signed by PLO leadership who did it behind our [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=74.56s)]
*  shoulders so we had to unite and we called for always for national unity because unity [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=84.64s)]
*  for a people under occupation is a kind of arms also. So and we have the same many now. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=93.04s)]
*  We are working on the ground all together and even before that when Gaza was attacked for [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=103.2s)]
*  five times during 2008 and now Israel wants to say that they are attacking Hamas [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  but the children are not Hamas, women are not Hamas, they are attacking our people [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=123.28s)]
*  and it's a genocide attack this time. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  Gaza now is all over the world. The area of Gaza is now going to all continents because people of [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=132.8s)]
*  the world who support the struggle of the Palestinians even though if they kill and kill [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=147.60000000000002s)]
*  and kill but there will stay life in Gaza and you are the eyes of Gaza now, you are the media. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=154.08s)]
*  So we are not afraid of what Netanyahu saying. They are afraid because always the Palestinians [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=162.16s)]
*  are bound to hope to implement their dreams by struggling by going to arms and other means of [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=171.28s)]
*  resistance. They didn't stop this way that the Palestinian chose. We don't have the choice of [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=183.84s)]
*  luxury anyhow and we don't have this luxury. We have only one choice is to fight and to liberate [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=191.44s)]
*  our land and to liberate ourselves also from this occupation that is doing what the Nazis did the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=198.8s)]
*  same but they added more because the arms are new now. They are making Holocaust and it is a war [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=207.28s)]
*  crime now what they are doing. That's why we called upon ourselves all over in Palestine to [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=217.04s)]
*  unite and still we didn't achieve unity as a political issue but we achieve unity on the field [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=226.0s)]
*  when Israel attacks. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=236.48s)]
*  The United Nations in 1948 recognized Israel as a state and didn't recognize us as a people who have [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  the right for self-determination or let the return to our homelands that we were picked out by force [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  from the Zionist groups in 1948. The United Nations recognized Israel as a state and didn't recognize [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=256.56s)]
*  1948. Since then they drew many resolutions but not implemented. Now yesterday the Security Council [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=266.56s)]
*  of the United Nations did not accept the Russian bill for denouncing the attack from Israel and [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=282.88s)]
*  only five countries who said yes for it and out of 15 so it didn't pass. We know now the world is [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=293.12s)]
*  divided according to the interests because the interest of the United States is to defend their [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=303.92s)]
*  base, the arson in Palestine which they call Israel. Now I think that the world now is there are [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=315.2s)]
*  waves of people taking streets even in Washington and in Britain and everywhere in the world [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=326.08s)]
*  because they are supporting the right for the Palestinians to have their own state and to live [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=334.24s)]
*  on that state with dignity and with justice. But you have seen now we don't depend upon the United [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=342.56s)]
*  Nations we depend first upon ourselves and then we have a lot of people all over the world supporting [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=350.16s)]
*  us. This gives us the strength and to bear the sufferings. We are ready to pay for our homeland, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=358.08000000000004s)]
*  to pay blood, to pay from our flesh, to pay our families to liberate this land because without [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=366.32s)]
*  that any freedom needs also people to sacrifice. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=375.59999999999997s)]
*  We know that they speak about terrorism but they are the heroes of terrorism, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=386.96s)]
*  the imperialists fought everywhere in the world in Iraq, in Syria, in different countries and now [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=394.72s)]
*  they are preparing to attack China and all the what they say about terrorism it tells to be for [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=402.96s)]
*  people have the right to resist with all means including [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=415.44s)]
*  armed struggle. This is in the charter of the United Nations so they are violating this. They [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=422.08s)]
*  are violating the right for the people for resistance because it's their right to restore [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=428.16s)]
*  their freedom and this is as I say always it's a fundamental law where there is repression, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=433.52s)]
*  there is resistance for it. People will not live under occupation and under depression of all kinds [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=445.03999999999996s)]
*  in the world and history learned us that people can when they resist they can [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=453.2s)]
*  then keep their dignity and their land. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=460.08000000000004s)]
*  We have a history of resistance and we declared from the beginning that to restore a homeland [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=470.08000000000004s)]
*  and to be free it means generation after generation. What happened in Palestine we were [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=478.56s)]
*  picked out of our own land and others came from outside with with armed and they made massacres [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=486.0s)]
*  in Palestine. It's the Zionist movement that prepared for that and the West supported the [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=494.56s)]
*  Zionist until now they are supporting them. Why? It's because they want this is the arsenal that [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=501.52s)]
*  the West in the Arab countries and in the Middle East they want to defend it so they to [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=508.96s)]
*  what I say to justify their attitude they want to say that we are again facing the terrorists. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=517.4399999999999s)]
*  What's happening? What is this? This is terrorism and there are state terrorism also represented by [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=528.8s)]
*  Israel and represented by other governments who are against their people. Until now we had in this [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=536.1600000000001s)]
*  conference and other conferences how people are suffering from their governments because they are [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=548.0s)]
*  on the side of the United States or I mean the United States is always interfering in different [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=555.76s)]
*  countries and imagine to call Latin America is the background back [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=564.88s)]
*  backyard of the United States. They insult the people, their land, their governments even who [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=575.28s)]
*  are allies with them they are pressured always to say this word it means that they don't care [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=585.8399999999999s)]
*  about the people and their freedom to live in their country to have their resources [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=592.16s)]
*  whether from water or from other natural resources and they always want to steal the [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=597.52s)]
*  oil from the countries that have oil. Look what happened in Venezuela they don't want to [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=605.4399999999999s)]
*  make democracy they are spreading fear they are spreading hatred everywhere they go [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=612.9599999999999s)]
*  under a slogan we want to democratize the people in this country and that country [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=622.0s)]
*  as if the people don't have minds to get their what they need not what they want and unfortunately [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=628.7199999999999s)]
*  and up till now when this conference was speaking discussing and in the struggle against imperialism [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=637.76s)]
*  they because they feel the injustice for their people for their countries for the resources [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=646.8s)]
*  and so on this is not in Venezuela only but in all Latin America because Latin America is [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=655.04s)]
*  having resources for any trade for industry they want to steal it and then the people they don't [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=663.8399999999999s)]
*  have any choice except to revolt. What happened in Chile at the time of Pinochet this is it was [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=672.96s)]
*  genocide also what happened in Argentina what happened in Cuba Cuba for 60 years under the [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=682.88s)]
*  siege but still Cuba is standing in front of them so and they are building their fight Cuba is [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=690.08s)]
*  building its country they export doctors to the whole world in the time of the corona we have seen [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=699.2s)]
*  how many doctors went to Italy to Italy in Europe as if Europe needs more and in Africa they sent [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=707.84s)]
*  their doctors it means that this country and its people when they revolted they reached to the point [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=717.5200000000001s)]
*  to declare socialism in their country and its expression for the outside and [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=725.84s)]
*  we look upon Cuba Cuba as one of the lessons that we are learning from them. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=734.64s)]
*  You know I began the fight when I was 16 years old I joined a movement it's an Arabic national movement [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=741.12s)]
*  and I was not accepted as a member at that time so they said you are young I said okay I can help [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=759.04s)]
*  so we were I mean I have activity I mean we go to demonstrations and so I was living in Lebanon [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=766.64s)]
*  and then after 1967 I was in Kuwait as a teacher and I quit teaching I joined the revolution [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=777.2800000000001s)]
*  through popular from for the liberation of Palestine because it's a part of it was the [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=790.32s)]
*  leadership is a part of the Arab national movement and initiated and founded BFLP for [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=796.32s)]
*  the revolution that broke out at that time so I was dead and I had to do that mission the first [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=805.44s)]
*  mission was to hijack a plane and this I never heard about hijacking never in our terminology [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=815.76s)]
*  we have struggled we have fights we have to be able to be in prisons but this terminology was [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=824.4s)]
*  very new to my mind and okay when I was trained in BFLP from the beginning had a slogan men and [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=833.52s)]
*  women are in the battle of liberation so it was implemented in this way and at the same time to [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=846.64s)]
*  represent also not only the Palestinians but all women who are under oppression whoever be in the [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=855.28s)]
*  nationality because in our thinking and ideas that we Palestinian cause is not only for [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=866.48s)]
*  Palestinians but it's a part of the international liberation movement and to show that [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=877.52s)]
*  to implement the idea by itself when I was in the cockpit I had to introduce myself for them [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=884.64s)]
*  I took the name of the first martyr woman after 1967 Shadia Abu Wazali and I told the captain [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=894.16s)]
*  because I had to inform who are we then I said we are from Che Guevara unit to show the link [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=903.04s)]
*  in between us and the liberation movement that was a tactic that we used and we we intended to [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=913.04s)]
*  do it just to the world will listen to us because they didn't listen to us when we were in camps [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=923.1999999999999s)]
*  when the camps fly out when we were sleeping to the sea in Lebanon for example they didn't hear [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=932.48s)]
*  the sufferings of the women and men prisoners in chains and the tortures so we thought that if we [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=940.8000000000001s)]
*  do this the people will hear why they will ask the question why why are they who are they and we [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=952.72s)]
*  wanted that to to be done in in any a fantastic way and without hurting anybody and this we did it [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=960.72s)]
*  any a clean operation when I remember that I say I'm happy and not taken it that I participated [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=974.8000000000001s)]
*  in a multi [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=990.56s)]
*  walls to achieve we wanted to release our prisoners we know very well and we knew very well [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=995.36s)]
*  that the passengers have nothing to do with the conflict but we were very much instructed by our [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=1002.7199999999999s)]
*  leaders don't hurt anybody neither the passengers nor unless somebody attacks you but we will not [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=1012.24s)]
*  while the second time I was on the israeli plane we knew that there are armed men on the plane [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=1022.64s)]
*  so the minute we stood up they were shooting and they in front of my eyes they shot my and today [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=1033.7600000000002s)]

*  will kill me but they didn't kill me so I'm here and the pilot was the the israelis put in charged [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=1049.3600000000001s)]

*  the oppressors and they are strong enough to send their message and you can be also [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=1519.84s)]
*  strong enough to to have the message for the world this is one thing for the international community [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=1528.0s)]
*  today and yesterday and before yesterday and before that we feel that we depend upon people [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=1537.2s)]
*  struggle we don't depend upon governments even if they declare that they are with us [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=1543.6s)]
*  we don't depend on them we don't depend upon progressive forces in the communities you are [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=1550.8799999999999s)]
*  living in and also to spread the facts of the struggle and how it is related to the capitalists [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=1557.6799999999998s)]
*  not only as occupation but it is related directly to the imperialists because the [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=1566.72s)]
*  Zionist movement is a part of the imperialists so we we have to unite we have to [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=1573.2s)]
*  you know there are means to have contacts very quick information on social media now [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=1582.88s)]

*  not as one organization but as a wide front to face the enemies because they are the enemies of [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=1600.6399999999999s)]
*  human beings everywhere against humanity [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=1611.6s)]

*  close their embassies in your countries especially here in South Africa you can do it and because [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=1626.8s)]
*  if they are still on your land you are recognizing them as ambassadors [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=1638.72s)]
*  whose government is killing our people this is not only for people also for governments [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBvzyKL-G4&t=1646.4s)]
