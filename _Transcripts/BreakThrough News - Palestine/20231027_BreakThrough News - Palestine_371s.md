# Here’s Why U.S. Elites Support Israel No Matter What
**BreakThrough News - Palestine:** [October 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA)
*  Here's where the US supports Israel no matter what. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=0.0s)]
*  The US-Israel relationship is unlike any other relationship the US has. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=3.06s)]
*  Israel's by far the biggest recipient of US foreign aid in the world. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=7.28s)]
*  Despite constituting about 0.01% of the world population, they've received 30% of all [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=11.28s)]
*  US foreign aid since World War II. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=18.16s)]
*  They get about $4 billion every year and have received almost $300 billion since 1945 when [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  you adjust for inflation, which is enough money to end world hunger. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=25.84s)]
*  But what's more shocking is that this support is unconditional. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=29.28s)]
*  It goes through every year basically unanimously. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=33.24s)]
*  Even right now, when we see Israel committing atrocity after atrocity and the entire world [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=36.64s)]
*  condemning the massacre of Gaza, the US government is actually trying to send more money to Israel. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=41.88s)]
*  The US ruling class also gives unconditional diplomatic cover for Israel. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=47.14s)]
*  Despite repeated attempts by the international community to prosecute Israel for its violations [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=51.28s)]
*  of international law, they can't. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=55.64s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=58.2s)]
*  Because the United States always comes in to protect Israel. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=59.2s)]
*  For example, during Israel's 2014 massacre of Gaza, the United Nations Human Rights Council [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=62.24s)]
*  voted on a resolution to denounce Israel's massacre. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=67.60000000000001s)]
*  Of the 38 countries on the council, the United States was the only country to vote no. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=70.60000000000001s)]
*  The US is almost always one of a handful of countries that votes against UN resolutions [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=76.2s)]
*  condemning Israel, while the rest of the world overwhelmingly votes the other way. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=80.62s)]
*  So why does the US do this? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=85.68s)]
*  The crux of it is that the US is an empire. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=88.24s)]
*  It has over a thousand military bases allittered all around the world, military units that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=90.78s)]
*  can invade any corner of the globe in a matter of hours. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=95.6s)]
*  Its goal, like every other empire in history, is to control the world's resources and markets [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=99.3s)]
*  and force its will on the entire world. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=104.6s)]
*  The Middle East is especially important to any empire because that's where so much oil [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=107.34s)]
*  and global trade passes through. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=111.72s)]
*  Israel is essentially America's attack dog in the Middle East. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=114.16s)]
*  Any job that the US can't do, or would look too imperialistic to do, Israel carries out [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=116.96s)]
*  on its behalf. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  Israel has played a crucial role in attacking and destabilizing independent Arab governments [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=123.11999999999999s)]
*  determined to defy US dictates. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=127.47999999999999s)]
*  In 1967, Israel attacked two such governments in Syria and Egypt in a surprise invasion. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=129.76s)]
*  Israel's narrative has always been that they launched a preemptive strike to prevent an [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=135.51999999999998s)]
*  impending Arab genocide of Jews, but in reality Israel just wanted to take Arab land. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=139.28s)]
*  Matthew Pellad, one of Israel's commanders in the Six Day War, told the Israeli newspaper [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=145.16s)]
*  Haaretz, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=149.72s)]
*  The thesis that the danger of genocide was hanging over us in June 1967 and that Israel [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=150.72s)]
*  was fighting for its physical existence is only a bluff, which was born and developed [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=156.24s)]
*  after the war. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=161.16s)]
*  This invasion was crucial at a time when 550,000 American troops were bogged down in Vietnam, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=162.66s)]
*  fighting the spread of socialism there. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  The Library of Congress study of the Israeli war recounted, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=169.92s)]
*  The traumatic defeat of the Syrians and Egyptians in the June 1967 war with Israel discredited [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=173.44s)]
*  the radical socialist regimes of Nasus Egypt and Baathist Syria. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=179.44s)]
*  The defeat strengthened the hands of the moderates and the rightists. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=184.0s)]
*  In 1981, Israel bombed an Iraqi nuclear power plant with US approval at a time when the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=187.7s)]
*  US was publicly supporting Iraq in the Iran-Iraq War. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=193.48s)]
*  Secretly the US wanted both governments to destroy each other, but couldn't be seen [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=197.48s)]
*  as playing such an intentionally destabilizing role. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=201.24s)]
*  In 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon with the full support and funding from the United States [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=204.16s)]
*  in an attempt to crush the Palestinian resistance there and appoint an ultra-right-wing Lebanese [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=208.76000000000002s)]
*  phalangist as president. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=213.68s)]
*  The US would end up sending Marines in to aid this effort, only to be defeated by the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=215.64000000000001s)]
*  Lebanese resistance forces. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=219.72s)]
*  Israel also has a long history of doing the empire's bidding outside of the Middle East. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=221.68s)]
*  Israel continued to arm and support apartheid South Africa even after it became too unpopular [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=226.20000000000002s)]
*  for the US to do so. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=231.2s)]
*  Israel even built an electrified fence around Namibia, then a South African colony, to protect [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=233.04s)]
*  it from neighboring Angolan Liberation Forces. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=237.94s)]
*  Israeli police helped train torturers in the US-backed Pinochet dictatorship in Chile. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=241.11999999999998s)]
*  They trained the right-wing Guatemalan army that was committing genocide against indigenous [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=245.51999999999998s)]
*  people. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=249.95999999999998s)]
*  Israel has also been a loyal partner in the US war on terror. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=251.12s)]
*  The Islamophobic hysteria following 9-11 gave the US an excuse to attack any country that [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=254.39999999999998s)]
*  stood against its interests in the region, especially Iran. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=259.74s)]
*  While the US has been careful not to directly strike Iran, Israel has served a very useful [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=263.18s)]
*  purpose by continuing to bully and harass Iran, assassinating its nuclear scientists, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=267.42s)]
*  seizing Iranian ships, and providing intelligence on Iran through massive spy networks. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=272.98s)]
*  Israel also routinely bombed Syria, a country the US attempted to topple in 2011. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=278.5s)]
*  Just by being there, Israel gives the US a constant excuse to intervene in the region [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=284.22s)]
*  under the guise of protecting Israel. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=288.66s)]
*  As Joe Biden once put it, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=291.1s)]
*  Were there not an Israel, the United States of America would have to invent an Israel [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=292.46000000000004s)]
*  to protect her interest in the region. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=297.46000000000004s)]
*  Israel is so central to the function of the empire that any kind of willing departure [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=300.42s)]
*  from Israel by the US ruling class is basically out of the question. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=304.62s)]
*  While many people understandably feel pessimistic about liberating Palestine, while Israel is [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=308.94000000000005s)]
*  supported by such a tremendous superpower, consider this. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=313.74s)]
*  Public support for Israel has rapidly declined in the US in the last few years. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=317.42s)]
*  Americans are starting to see what their tax dollars are paying for, and they're standing [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=321.78000000000003s)]
*  up and saying, not in our name. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=325.0s)]
*  There's a growing divide between the politicians who staunchly support Israel and their constituents [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=326.86s)]
*  who see Israel for what it is. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=332.24s)]
*  If this divide continues to grow, it could fundamentally break people's confidence [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=334.44s)]
*  in these politicians and lead to a larger breakdown in the legitimacy of the political [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=338.62s)]
*  system. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=343.02000000000004s)]
*  And the same could be said about any anti-imperialist struggle. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=344.02000000000004s)]
*  Whether it's the struggle to end the murderous and archaic blockade on Cuba, the struggle [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=347.02s)]
*  to end the murderous and archaic sanctions regimes against Venezuela, Iran, or Korea, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=351.29999999999995s)]
*  or the struggle to end the siege on Gaza, the entire world is fed up with US hegemony [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=357.09999999999997s)]
*  and world policing. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=362.7s)]
*  If these movements link arms and see themselves as one common struggle, no force on earth [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=363.7s)]
*  can stop them. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH8d7UJNmaA&t=369.85999999999996s)]
