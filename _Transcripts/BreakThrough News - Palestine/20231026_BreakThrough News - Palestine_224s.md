# Congressional Staffers Are Turning Against Israel. Here’s What One of Them Told Us
**BreakThrough News - Palestine:** [October 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08)
*  It's a genocide. I'm a congressional staffer, been on the Hill for several years. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=0.0s)]
*  Processing the images and videos, firsthand accounts, you know, it's harder to stay away from using the term genocide. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=5.44s)]
*  Have you heard any of your other colleagues express privately that they're just disgusted by what's happening? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=12.64s)]
*  Oh yeah, so many. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=19.44s)]
*  There are few institutions in the world more loyal to the state of Israel than the United States Congress. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=20.88s)]
*  Giving Israel nearly $4 billion a year, and almost $300 billion since the end of World War II, a sum large enough to end world hunger, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=26.16s)]
*  the United States relationship with Israel has been described as unconditional. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=33.68s)]
*  In the last few weeks, Congress passed a resolution essentially rubber-stamping Israel's massacre of Gaza. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  Few would expect any change to come from the halls of Congress. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=42.8s)]
*  But in the last few weeks, we've seen staffers in Congress and executive departments express their opposition to Israel's massacre through letters and resignations. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=45.68s)]
*  Tonight, we're speaking to an anonymous Capitol Hill staffer who's disgusted with Israel's massacre of Gaza and describes it as a genocide. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=53.84s)]
*  When you see these images coming out of Gaza, how does it make you feel to know that it's people you're working alongside that are really enabling this? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  Hmm. Yeah, it's definitely hard to work in an institution like this. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=70.0s)]
*  I always tell people, you know, kind of like be kind to each other and cruel to institutions. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=77.6s)]
*  And like, I think there's a lot of, you know, moneyed interests that have like, you know, strong influence over, you know, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=81.92s)]
*  democratically elected members of Congress who are supposed to represent their constituencies. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=89.44s)]
*  When they're making these policy decisions for members of Congress, they're doing so with extremely limited information. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=94.8s)]
*  So they'll kind of like take, you know, the talking points or the paragraph fact sheets that they get from lobbyists or other special interest groups. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=103.28s)]
*  So you're saying some of the people that are making these decisions don't even really understand the issues? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=113.28s)]
*  Correct. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=118.48s)]
*  Have you heard any of your other colleagues, other staffers, express privately that they're just, you know, disgusted by what's happening? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=119.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah, so many. I mean, I think like there are a lot in all sorts of offices, whether it's like, you know, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=128.08s)]
*  someone who works for a progressive member, someone who works for like a more moderate Democrat. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=136.08s)]
*  It's like, you know, in every single congressional district, we have levels of poverty, lots of unhoused folk, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=141.6s)]
*  children who go to school, hungry or malnourished. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=149.36s)]
*  Like, hey, we got money for, you know, wars, but we don't have money to feed children. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=153.44000000000003s)]
*  We don't have money to, you know, cancel student debt so that people can kind of move on with their lives. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=159.68s)]
*  You could have chosen not to speak to us. You could have chosen to just go on with your work. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=164.32000000000002s)]
*  Why did you choose to speak out about this issue? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=169.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think as a Jewish staffer on the Hill, it's really important all Jewish voices are heard. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=171.84s)]
*  I think there is kind of like a generational divide among Jews in the United States on their perspective [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=178.8s)]
*  towards Palestinian liberation. I want to hopefully give other Jews on the Hill and maybe Jews elsewhere, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=186.16000000000003s)]
*  you know, some courage. Like, hopefully, you know, they see this and like, oh, like there are, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=192.96s)]
*  you know, hopefully they feel less alone and maybe more confident in speaking up in their workplace. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  Staff should speak up. No one can limit your free speech. Even though some, you know, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=202.32000000000002s)]
*  offices might try to, they really can't. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=207.52s)]
*  Do you have any message you'd want to send to the Palestinian people? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=210.56s)]
*  You've got some friends here and in the heart of the empire who see your courage and who love you [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  endlessly and extend a ton of solidarity. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpYIZ-_BL08&t=220.88s)]
