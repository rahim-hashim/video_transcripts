Israel’s genocide in Gaza has shocked the conscience of the entire world, with an endless flow of videos and images of Palestinian children cut into pieces by American bombs dropped by Israeli warplanes deliberately intended to destroy a civilian population. Despite the explicitly genocidal rhetoric of Israeli officials, Western leaders continue to proclaim their support for Israel’s right to “defend itself.” But this war on Gaza is different from past wars, not only in the level of Israeli aggression, but in the reaction on the street, from the Middle East to the United States. Israel is losing the narrative war. Most people want to see a ceasefire and tens of thousands have protested across the US to demonstrate their opposition to Biden’s unconditional support for this genocide. 
To discuss Israel’s genocidal onslaught in Gaza ahead of a looming ground invasion and how it has the potential to snowball into a catastrophic regional war, Rania Khalek was joined by journalist Abby Martin, creator and host of The Empire Files.

# Genocidal Onslaught on Gaza Shocks Conscience of the World, w/ Abby Martin
**BreakThrough News - Palestine:** [October 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE)
*  And my question to the international community and Americans, how many kids? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=0.0s)]
*  How many kids will it take for you to have your humanity? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=5.0s)]
*  Three thousand, five thousand, ten thousand. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=8.16s)]
*  How many babies do you need to see dead and pulled out of rubble [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=10.56s)]
*  for you to have basic human empathy and dignity as a human being? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=15.32s)]
*  How many kids? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=20.32s)]
*  Hello, everyone. I'm Rania Khalek, and this is Dispatches. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=22.36s)]
*  Israel's genocide in Gaza has shocked the world [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  with an endless flow of videos and images of Palestinian children [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=28.96s)]
*  cut into pieces by American bombs dropped by Israeli warplanes [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=33.08s)]
*  deliberately intended to destroy a civilian population. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=38.2s)]
*  Israeli leaders have said as much. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=42.6s)]
*  Despite the explicitly genocidal rhetoric of Israeli officials, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=45.16s)]
*  Western leaders continue to proclaim their support for Israel's right [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=49.32s)]
*  to defend itself. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=53.24s)]
*  Over 2000 Palestinian children have been slaughtered [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  in the merciless carpet bombing of what amounts to a ghetto. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=57.8s)]
*  Yet we're told by the mainstream corporate media [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=61.76s)]
*  that it's their fault for resisting their extermination. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=64.39999999999999s)]
*  It's their fault for hating Israel. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=67.92s)]
*  It's their fault, we're even told, because actually they bombed themselves. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  But this war on Gaza is different than past wars, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=76.84s)]
*  not only in the scale of Israeli aggression, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=79.92s)]
*  but in the reaction on the street from the Middle East to the United States. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=82.64s)]
*  While Western media runs cover for Israeli atrocities, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=87.11999999999999s)]
*  people are losing their jobs across various industries for speaking out. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=90.6s)]
*  The suppression has never been this intense. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=94.64s)]
*  Yet still, Israel is losing the narrative war. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=97.32s)]
*  Most people want to see a ceasefire, and tens of thousands have protested [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=100.44s)]
*  across the US to demonstrate their opposition to Biden's [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=104.67999999999999s)]
*  unconditional support for this genocide. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=109.08s)]
*  Joining me to discuss Israel's genocidal onslaught in Gaza [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=112.03999999999999s)]
*  and how it has the potential to snowball into a catastrophic regional war, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=115.64s)]
*  I'm joined by journalist Abby Martin, creator and host of The Empire Files. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=120.19999999999999s)]
*  Abby Martin, welcome to you, because obviously we're going to be talking about [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=126.36s)]
*  the horrific genocide that's taking place in Gaza. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=129.12s)]
*  And I just want to clarify, we are recording this before there has been [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=133.32s)]
*  a ground invasion, but obviously every day, every hour that could change. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=137.24s)]
*  So if that has happened after this goes out, just keep that in mind as you watch this. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=142.0s)]
*  But anyways, Abby, I guess, like, there's so much to discuss. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=148.24s)]
*  You've done so much journalism on the issue of Palestine, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=151.72s)]
*  both on the ground and away. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=156.48s)]
*  And I want to start off by asking you about your documentary [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=158.32s)]
*  Gaza Frights for Freedom, which was released in 2019. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=161.56s)]
*  And that was four years ago. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=165.32s)]
*  And it's an excellent documentary for anybody who hasn't watched it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=167.0s)]
*  I encourage you to go check it out after you've watched this episode. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=170.0s)]
*  I will include a link to it in the description. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=172.6s)]
*  And it's still making a huge impact to help people understand [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=175.44s)]
*  the situation that Gaza is in, which has obviously gotten like [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=178.68s)]
*  significantly worse in the last two weeks. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=183.68s)]
*  But can you maybe start out by telling our audience, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=185.92s)]
*  what is Gaza Frights for Freedom about and why does it still matter [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=188.16s)]
*  as we witness the atrocities being committed against Gaza right now? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=191.6s)]
*  Well, Ronnie, I think everyone has that light bulb moment. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=196.56s)]
*  Like mine was the Gaza Flotilla massacre in 2010 when Israeli commandos, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=199.16s)]
*  you know, jumped on a ship in international waters and just executed, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=203.76s)]
*  I think, like nine peace activists, one American citizen. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=207.56s)]
*  And then, of course, the fog of war coming out of that attack was [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=211.12s)]
*  literally apologizing and whitewashing this massacre. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=214.96s)]
*  And I think that that really woke me up to, wow, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=218.2s)]
*  something is very, very wrong with what we're being told [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=221.96s)]
*  with this so-called Israel-Palestine conflict. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=225.24s)]
*  And then, you know, everything compounded as I started working with Palestinians. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=227.44s)]
*  And every time Israel would go on [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=231.04s)]
*  one of their bombardments of Gaza every couple of years, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=234.76s)]
*  bombing people in essentially a caged area, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=237.68s)]
*  my friends and colleagues that were Palestinian had to check in [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=240.76s)]
*  every couple of hours to see if their families were dead or alive. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=244.24s)]
*  And it was just so harrowing and so horrifying. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=248.36s)]
*  Fast forward to the Great March of Return. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=251.64s)]
*  This was, I think, when Mike and I went to the occupied West Bank [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=253.28s)]
*  in 2017. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=257.28s)]
*  This was a year before Palestinians in Gaza decided to do this mass [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=259.4s)]
*  civil disobedience action, where for 18 months [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=263.96s)]
*  they were going out every single Friday, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=268.0s)]
*  tens of thousands at the beginning. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=271.52s)]
*  And then it kind of whittled down into just thousands of people. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=273.52s)]
*  I mean, this was a consistent, determined action, completely unarmed [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=277.35999999999996s)]
*  men, women, children, medics, journalists, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=283.4s)]
*  all of these people went out. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=286.4s)]
*  It was in no way directed or engineered by Hamas. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=287.79999999999995s)]
*  This cartoonish depiction of Hamas, you know, stage managing everything in Gaza [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=291.15999999999997s)]
*  and taking away Palestinians agency. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=295.23999999999995s)]
*  It was devised by a poet named Ahmed Artema, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=297.56s)]
*  who just simply wanted to kind of do this peaceful [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=301.88s)]
*  action where he was drawing attention to their plight as refugees. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=306.88s)]
*  And it was mostly symbolic to erect tents and basically [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=310.12s)]
*  call attention to their plight as refugees and show the international community, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=313.76s)]
*  look, you know, we're still here [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=318.56s)]
*  generations later as besieged refugees, ethnically cleansed right from, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=321.36s)]
*  you know, this partition where our ancestral lands are just right there. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=326.48s)]
*  We can see them that we can't go to them. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=329.68s)]
*  And I think we know what happened, Rania, is that Israeli snipers [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=331.52000000000004s)]
*  perched up on hilltops just took everyone out [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=334.84000000000003s)]
*  looking at people, civilians through their scopes. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=338.6s)]
*  Their sniper scopes and took out journalists, medics, children, disabled people. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=342.88s)]
*  These are all egregious war crimes under the Geneva [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=347.68s)]
*  Conventions in a standing army, like between armies and armed battle. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=350.04s)]
*  It's still egregious war crimes to target those protected groups. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=355.32s)]
*  So the fact that there were no militants shooting at Israeli soldiers, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=358.92s)]
*  it was just simply civilians en masse and Israeli snipers still [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=362.32s)]
*  pick them off one by one every couple hours. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=366.44s)]
*  You would hear the shot ring out and people would just drop dead [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=369.64s)]
*  or drop injured and wounded and be brought back to the ambulances. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=373.15999999999997s)]
*  And then, of course, they would target the ambulances. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=377.0s)]
*  And when this happened, I just thought there's nothing [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=379.4s)]
*  that's going to be more egregious than this. Right. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=383.44s)]
*  I mean, Israel is committing such heinous war crimes for all the world to see. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=385.84s)]
*  And there's no argument. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=391.32s)]
*  There's no argument that they could give. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=392.68s)]
*  There's no fog of war. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=394.2s)]
*  There's no flipping the script here. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=395.36s)]
*  Like, that's why we wanted to work with Palestinian journalists [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=396.96000000000004s)]
*  to tell this story, because I just thought, look, this is such a clear [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=399.68s)]
*  cut case of Israeli war crimes. It's incontrovertible. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=403.12s)]
*  It's super proven. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=406.24s)]
*  We base the entire framework of the movie around this UN report that was released. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=407.6s)]
*  Everything's documented. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=411.88s)]
*  But, Rania, it just didn't matter. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=413.68s)]
*  And now, you know, 2023, that that was four years ago, as you mentioned. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=415.88s)]
*  Israel's taking out as many people as they killed in the Great March of Return [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=420.88s)]
*  in like every couple hours. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=424.84s)]
*  I can't keep up with the amount of civilians that are dying in mass, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=426.91999999999996s)]
*  because in the Great March of Return, it was 214 people [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=430.91999999999996s)]
*  that were picked off by Israeli snipers, 8000 people shot with live ammunition. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=434.47999999999996s)]
*  And now every couple hours, I'm hearing that hundreds of people, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=439.84s)]
*  you know, are dying every couple hours. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=443.32s)]
*  And it's just like you think that it can't get worse. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=445.35999999999996s)]
*  And it just does. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=448.0s)]
*  And they made the Great March of Return about Israel, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=449.23999999999995s)]
*  and they made it about the human shields. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=451.64s)]
*  And they continued to pose as the victim even during that. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=453.88s)]
*  And international law did nothing. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=458.84s)]
*  And the UN sat back and did nothing. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=460.76s)]
*  And the US continued to green light Israeli apartheid. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=463.08s)]
*  And so the audacity, the hubris and the arrogance of thinking that you can keep [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=466.08s)]
*  2.3 million people in this caged ghetto and not expect anything to happen. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=470.08s)]
*  And so that's led us to where we are today. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=476.52s)]
*  And even in the movie, it said that, you know, by 2020, the UN was saying, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=478.64s)]
*  this is an uninhabitable area, the lack of potable water. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=482.44s)]
*  I mean, all of those things. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=486.52s)]
*  So that was four years ago. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=489.24s)]
*  And it was already 50 percent of all diseases were because of toxic water. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=491.0s)]
*  I mean, how is this sustainable? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=495.32s)]
*  I mean, obviously, it's not. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=498.52s)]
*  And now Gaza is dealing with a situation where it's just being completely leveled. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=499.68s)]
*  You have Israeli leaders essentially saying we want to turn it into a parking lot. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=503.76s)]
*  And I just honestly, at this point, it's like you have no words anymore. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=508.15999999999997s)]
*  Because just watching image after image, I'm just not sure, like, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=513.1600000000001s)]
*  what is the world's threshold for videos of Palestinian children in Gaza [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=516.2s)]
*  being chopped into pieces by American bombs delivered by Israeli jets? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=521.32s)]
*  Like, obviously over 2000. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=526.5200000000001s)]
*  And that's probably an underestimate because like right now they're talking about [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=528.8800000000001s)]
*  hospitals shutting down. They've run out of fuel. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=532.9200000000001s)]
*  I mean, you think about like the babies and incubators lie [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=536.1600000000001s)]
*  that the US spread in the lead up to the first Gulf War [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=540.12s)]
*  in Congress, that famous lie. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=545.04s)]
*  In this case, it's not a lie. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=547.96s)]
*  Actually, babies and incubators in Gaza are very likely right now dying [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=549.6s)]
*  because Israel's denying fuel to hospitals. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=554.88s)]
*  And I just don't understand how anyone, anyone can see images of children. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=557.8s)]
*  I don't care who they are, just any children being chopped up into pieces [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=564.92s)]
*  and dying needlessly, being murdered and call that self-defense [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=568.8s)]
*  or standing by a civilized country or any of the insane rhetoric we've heard. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=574.1999999999999s)]
*  I'm sorry. I'm going to probably get a little angry throughout this [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=578.64s)]
*  because this is really outrageous. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=580.68s)]
*  But, you know, speaking to that, you know, I've seen you posting messages [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=583.4799999999999s)]
*  from your contacts in Gaza where the situation just sounds completely apocalyptic. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=587.76s)]
*  I actually just saw before we started recording that the Al Jazeera [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=594.24s)]
*  Arabic correspondent who is right now in Ramallah [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=598.04s)]
*  just got news that his family, his like wife and daughter and brother. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=601.52s)]
*  I mean, I think it was his brother, but basically his whole family [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=607.56s)]
*  was killed in an Israeli airstrike, by the way, on the south in Khan Yunis, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=609.8399999999999s)]
*  in the south, where they were told to evacuate. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=614.56s)]
*  So everybody, everybody from Gaza has family being killed. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=617.7199999999999s)]
*  I'm curious, what are you hearing from those, you know, on the ground in Gaza? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=621.28s)]
*  Well, so all the people that I'm in contact with were people [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=624.8s)]
*  that we we did the documentary with. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=627.2s)]
*  And so it's been it's been an apocalyptic nightmare [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=629.2800000000001s)]
*  unfolding for the last four years. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=632.4000000000001s)]
*  And to see my friends and colleagues who want to remain anonymous [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=634.48s)]
*  because we already have seen 20 journalists be killed. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=638.08s)]
*  You could argue whether they were targeted or not. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=642.6400000000001s)]
*  We know Shireen Abu Hakla certainly was. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=644.48s)]
*  And we know that the journalists during the Great March of Returns certainly were. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=647.32s)]
*  So regardless, there is no like accountability [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=651.6800000000001s)]
*  for all of these journalists who are losing their lives during this onslaught. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=655.72s)]
*  And so my you know, my colleagues do not want to be targeted. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=659.0s)]
*  And so that's why I'm, you know, not naming them. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=663.6800000000001s)]
*  But one of them who was our field producer through the entire movie [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=666.96s)]
*  has been rendered homeless by Israeli bombs. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=670.36s)]
*  He's been displaced three times. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=672.64s)]
*  Then he moved into his parents' home. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=674.6s)]
*  And then that's when they got the mass leaflets being dropped, saying [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=676.4s)]
*  everyone needs to leave to the north. I'm sorry, to the south. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=679.28s)]
*  And so they just aimlessly were fleeing to the south as bombs were dropping. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=682.6800000000001s)]
*  We know that Israel was bombing these aid convoys that they then later [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=687.2s)]
*  claim that Islamic Jihad booby trapped the aid convoy of people fleeing. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=691.24s)]
*  Absolutely barbaric, genocidal stuff. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=696.8000000000001s)]
*  Rania, my other colleague who's there, he woke up this morning [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=699.5200000000001s)]
*  to the news that his brother had been martyred, his brother [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=703.5600000000001s)]
*  living in a house with 30 people. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=707.0s)]
*  And I want to just read you. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=710.3199999999999s)]
*  I want to read you what he said. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=713.76s)]
*  And it it's sick. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=715.4399999999999s)]
*  This is where they're at right now. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=718.8s)]
*  He said my brother was martyred in a bombing of his friend's house, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=720.8399999999999s)]
*  and 30 people were killed, as usual, mostly women and children. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=723.4399999999999s)]
*  My brother left behind his wife and two children, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=727.1999999999999s)]
*  the youngest of whom is four months old. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=729.64s)]
*  We're in a state of intense sadness and fear. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=732.2399999999999s)]
*  Every moment that we will lose another person. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=735.4s)]
*  He was like, some people in other countries [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=737.76s)]
*  differ in opinion about whether they're going to eat today or have a break. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=740.16s)]
*  He was like, the ordeals that we're dealing with is if a bomb hits us, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=743.3599999999999s)]
*  there's no doubt that it will destroy all of us. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=748.04s)]
*  He was like, so we're trying to grapple with do we stay together [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=750.1999999999999s)]
*  or do we separate so we don't all die together? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=753.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=757.16s)]
*  I mean, it's insane that 40 miles away from this genocide [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=760.04s)]
*  taking place that you have Israelis going to the beach, going out to eat, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=765.1600000000001s)]
*  just live in their lives, Rania. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=769.2800000000001s)]
*  And you have our friends and brothers and sisters on the ground in Gaza [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=771.2800000000001s)]
*  deciding, hey, should we stick together so that if a bomb hits the house, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=775.5600000000001s)]
*  we'll all die together or should we separate so that one of us will live on [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=779.24s)]
*  and perhaps tell our stories and take care of our infants [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=783.24s)]
*  who won't have a family anymore? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=788.2s)]
*  I mean, just wrap your mind around how the decisions that are being made [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=789.9200000000001s)]
*  by people there. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=793.6s)]
*  And this isn't even to mention the fact that food and water and electricity [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=794.32s)]
*  have been cut off. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=798.24s)]
*  You know, because they're subhuman, they're animals. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=799.88s)]
*  In the words of these Israeli ministers and the US doesn't care. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=802.16s)]
*  Right. Liberals don't care about this. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=805.72s)]
*  Sarah Silverman was saying, hey, we're at the point that why do these animals [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=807.72s)]
*  deserve water and electricity? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=810.88s)]
*  So waterborne illnesses, foodborne illnesses, all of these things [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=812.96s)]
*  are happening. Aside from that, you mentioned babies. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=816.5600000000001s)]
*  I keep thinking of formula babies screaming, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=818.88s)]
*  starving to death, not even the ones being bombed and beheaded with bombs, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=823.4s)]
*  the ones who can't eat. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=829.2s)]
*  The people on dialysis, I mean, there's no time to even talk about those victims [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=831.96s)]
*  and there's no time to grieve the death and destruction that's happening [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=837.28s)]
*  aside from the heavy bombardment of Israeli bombs and to hear every day [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=841.16s)]
*  from my it's like I don't even know what to say other than I will do my best [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=846.44s)]
*  to like share this information and hope that it will help humanize [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=850.64s)]
*  the plight of what is going on. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=854.36s)]
*  And that is just when you put it like that, it's so insane [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=857.52s)]
*  to think about on top of everything you just described. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=862.16s)]
*  There's this like worldwide gaslighting going on where it's your fault. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=865.6s)]
*  You're bombing yourselves. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=871.4s)]
*  You're basically all human shields for a terrorist organization [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=873.52s)]
*  that is the same as ISIS. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=877.88s)]
*  It's your fault. You hate Israel. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=879.72s)]
*  You're anti-Semites. You deserve this. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=881.28s)]
*  And just by world leaders. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=883.88s)]
*  And I mean, the reason I raise this, of course, is because, you know, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=885.36s)]
*  you've been covering the issue of Palestine through your journalistic career. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=887.6800000000001s)]
*  And I as all I know, I think all of us who've been following this issue [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=892.32s)]
*  recognize there are the same Israeli talking points every single time, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=895.8000000000001s)]
*  like a broken record, and they're all repeated ad nauseum by CNN, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=900.84s)]
*  by MSNBC, by BBC, by all the mainstream Western channels. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=906.12s)]
*  So I want to ask you to help our audience debunk some of these talking points. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=912.4399999999999s)]
*  One in particular that I think is very insidious is that you hear [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=917.68s)]
*  the Israelis and Biden and Anthony Blinken and Ursula Von der Leyen [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=921.16s)]
*  keep repeating every five minutes in tweets because they just have to remind us [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=925.76s)]
*  like every five minutes that they support this genocide and they stand with Israel. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=929.68s)]
*  And never to justify it, they keep repeating that Hamas is using [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=934.04s)]
*  how much they say Hamas doesn't represent Palestinians or their aspirations. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=938.52s)]
*  In fact, Hamas is using them as human shields, and that's why Palestinians are dying. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=942.52s)]
*  Therefore, Hamas is as actually responsible for all the dead children [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=946.8s)]
*  that Israel is killing. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=951.04s)]
*  And you've done, I think, a great job [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=952.7199999999999s)]
*  basically debunking this entire this entire claim. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=955.7199999999999s)]
*  So how should people, how do you at least, let's ask you that. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=960.84s)]
*  How do you respond to that claim as Israel inflicts its most vicious [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=964.6800000000001s)]
*  acts of violence against Gaza's civilian population? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=970.08s)]
*  How do you respond to the claim that Hamas is using Palestinians [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=973.04s)]
*  across Gaza as human shields? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=979.16s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's a really good point, because and I want to go back to the Hamas [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=981.84s)]
*  equals ISIS. Well, in fact, they were saying Hamas is worse than ISIS [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=985.04s)]
*  because they started off with that. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=989.4s)]
*  And that's why I think they wanted to just unload like aerial bombardment. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=991.28s)]
*  Similarly to what the US and Russia did with ISIS and Syria and Iraq. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=996.88s)]
*  And that was, you know, we know that those airstrikes were taking out [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1002.12s)]
*  hundreds of civilians at a time. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1005.8s)]
*  And there was kind of like, by the way, real quick, I just want to say [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1007.28s)]
*  it actually like mainstream American media has reported [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1010.9599999999999s)]
*  that Israel has dropped more bombs by the sixth day. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1014.4799999999999s)]
*  Israel had dropped more bombs than the US had in like a month [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1018.1600000000001s)]
*  of carpet bombing Iraq. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1021.84s)]
*  I just want to throw that in there. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1023.2s)]
*  Yes, crazy. That's really no, that's crazy, because we saw the aftermath [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1024.3200000000002s)]
*  of the rocket bombing. I mean, it was like leveled [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1028.76s)]
*  and there were hundreds of civilians that died. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1031.76s)]
*  And it was kind of secondary to think of all the civilian casualties [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1033.44s)]
*  because ISIS was like so barbaric and so subhuman that what we just needed [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1036.16s)]
*  to do everything we could to take out ISIS. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1041.16s)]
*  And that's what they wanted to cement in the first place. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1044.0s)]
*  But then I think people were seeing the horrors unfolding on the ground [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1047.36s)]
*  and Palestinians dictating their own reality through social media. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1050.8s)]
*  And so it's switched back to the old, tired human shield talking point, which. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1053.6s)]
*  Aside from just like picking a point, picking apart that narrative, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1059.4s)]
*  I mean, if you look at like the swath of the history of propaganda used [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1064.12s)]
*  toward American allies and I'm sorry, from American allies [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1070.64s)]
*  toward our so-called enemies back all the way from World War [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1074.32s)]
*  two and beyond and Vietnam and Korea and Iraq and Libya. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1078.56s)]
*  You can see that tired talking point being propelled by the mainstream media, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1083.4399999999998s)]
*  whether it's the Viet Cong, whether it's Gaddafi's, you know, civilians, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1087.8s)]
*  whether it's Iraqi civilians, it's always they're going to use human shields, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1092.04s)]
*  like basically anticipating there's going to be a large amount of civilian casualties, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1096.36s)]
*  but they're all human shields for these crazy dictators [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1100.04s)]
*  or for these crazy genocidal maniacs. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1103.44s)]
*  And so just know that it doesn't matter, you know, because they're the ones [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1105.88s)]
*  putting their civilians at risk. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1110.3600000000001s)]
*  And so it's always been a racist, dehumanizing trope and a veil, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1111.96s)]
*  like basically a veil to commit mass death and destruction. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1117.28s)]
*  And it's sick. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1122.24s)]
*  And for some reason, it just sticks with Palestinians. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1123.28s)]
*  Palestinians are continued to be called mindless human shields. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1126.3200000000002s)]
*  Their agency is completely taken away. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1130.24s)]
*  And they're all just looked at as some sort of death cult [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1133.0400000000002s)]
*  who martyrs their own children. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1135.8000000000002s)]
*  It is disgusting and it's sick. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1137.24s)]
*  And let's look at the propaganda, because Israel is basically saying [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1138.72s)]
*  everyone in the Gaza Strip is a human shield for Hamas because they elected [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1142.3600000000001s)]
*  Hamas in 2006. Well, they can't leave. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1145.0400000000002s)]
*  So first and foremost, it's a situation of Israel's own creation, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1148.2800000000002s)]
*  even if that were true. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1151.48s)]
*  They are not allowing civilians to flee. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1153.0400000000002s)]
*  It's the only place in the world that refugees can't even leave by boat [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1155.4s)]
*  if they wanted to. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1160.3600000000001s)]
*  They're shot in the waters if they stray too far. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1161.6000000000001s)]
*  They can't go into Rafa. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1164.72s)]
*  They can't go into the Erez crossing because Israeli snipers will shoot to kill. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1166.16s)]
*  There's like literally a no-go zone surrounding their entire partitioned land. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1170.88s)]
*  So it's crazy that Israel's like pretending that this is true [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1175.64s)]
*  when they've created the situation. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1179.0400000000002s)]
*  So putting that aside, their actual evidence that they always put forward [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1180.44s)]
*  are literal cartoon infographics. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1184.72s)]
*  They either release images of aerial [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1187.7199999999998s)]
*  infographics of Gaza with red squares around them. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1191.76s)]
*  And they're just like, here's a rocket launcher. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1194.76s)]
*  See, and it's right next to this UN building. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1196.76s)]
*  So naturally we have to blow up the shelter, right? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1198.4799999999998s)]
*  Because this rocket launcher is over a couple of streets away. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1201.36s)]
*  And it's just always this red square on like an aerial shot of the street. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1204.8s)]
*  It's like, OK, great, I'll take your word for it. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1210.04s)]
*  And then aside from that, they literally use infographics. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1213.24s)]
*  I'll never forget in during the Sheikh Jarrah [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1216.0s)]
*  horrible, like ethnic cleansing going on in Sheikh Jarrah [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1220.04s)]
*  and the pogroms that were going on and also during the Great March of Return, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1222.76s)]
*  they were releasing infographics of just cartoon images of people [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1225.76s)]
*  standing on rooftops holding missiles and grenade launchers. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1229.6s)]
*  And it's like, OK, that do you think that that's convincing everyone? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1232.16s)]
*  And then and then the argument completely falls apart [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1237.8s)]
*  when you look at the Great March of Return, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1240.08s)]
*  because they were using that argument to justify shooting [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1241.2s)]
*  elderly people and disabled people and children and medics and [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1244.4s)]
*  and journalists, and that that's outrageously false. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1248.44s)]
*  They were not human shields for anyone. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1251.44s)]
*  There were no militants there. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1253.76s)]
*  And so when you apply that logic just to that instance alone, Ronja, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1255.0800000000002s)]
*  the argument falls apart and their credibility is completely shot. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1259.8000000000002s)]
*  And so we can't trust anything that they say. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1263.44s)]
*  Everything Israel uses for their playbook has been debunked. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1266.88s)]
*  And then if you apply the same logic to Israel, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1270.6000000000001s)]
*  well, they're using human shields, too. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1273.4399999999998s)]
*  They have military bases in the middle of residential neighborhoods. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1275.6399999999999s)]
*  They broadcast from densely populated areas. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1278.28s)]
*  If Hamas targeted one of their military bases or one of their media towers, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1282.32s)]
*  is there any doubt that that would be called a war crime? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1286.0s)]
*  No. The standard of international law should be applied the same. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1288.4399999999998s)]
*  That that's the whole point. There should be no bias at all. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1292.2399999999998s)]
*  You should look at the facts and let the facts, you know, go where they go, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1294.8s)]
*  where they are. And unfortunately, there's a complete [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1299.36s)]
*  not only reversal of the truth, but just a misapplied version of international [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1302.68s)]
*  law that somehow only applies to who Israel deems its enemies. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1307.36s)]
*  And I'm sick of this whole Hamas run, Hamas led like narrative in the corporate [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1311.84s)]
*  media, too, as if that, again, takes away strips Palestinian agency [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1315.8s)]
*  and pretends like Hamas has a gun to the head of Palestinians who are like lying [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1320.0s)]
*  about their situation or about the horrors unfolding on the ground [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1324.92s)]
*  and immediately makes people think that they can't trust the news [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1328.1599999999999s)]
*  coming out of like the Hamas run health ministry about civilians [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1331.56s)]
*  dead or the Arab hospital bombing. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1335.8s)]
*  And it's just grotesque. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1339.0s)]
*  And so what Israel purposely tries to do with the human shield thing and beyond [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1340.6799999999998s)]
*  is just create this fog of war. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1343.96s)]
*  And what they're best at is deflecting and projecting what they do [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1346.2s)]
*  on the Palestinians. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1350.0s)]
*  And like you said, Palestinians bomb their own hospital, Rania. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1351.08s)]
*  What idiots, you know, just like Joe Biden said, Hamas got to learn [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1354.28s)]
*  to shoot straight. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1357.96s)]
*  I just can't. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1359.44s)]
*  I mean, wow, I don't even know what to like, I think you need to be prosecuted. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1361.44s)]
*  I don't even I don't even know, like what to do about Joe Biden [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1366.32s)]
*  and the fact that he can't speak. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1370.24s)]
*  And then when he does, he says things like that. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1372.0s)]
*  I just it's beyond. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1373.76s)]
*  This is like our president. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1377.28s)]
*  All right. Our reality is beyond comprehensive. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1379.04s)]
*  And, you know, when it comes to the issue of international law, one thing I will say [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1383.44s)]
*  is like at this point, I just can't get over people being like Israel has to conduct its war [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1386.4s)]
*  in the confines of international law. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1395.2s)]
*  That's the most you'll hear. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1396.64s)]
*  It's like just please carry out your genocide a little bit more politely. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1398.48s)]
*  I'm not really sure how many more Israeli leaders have to go on international [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1401.8400000000001s)]
*  television and state explicitly that they are, in fact, deliberately targeting civilians [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1406.8000000000002s)]
*  because they don't see Palestinians as human. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1412.96s)]
*  Or civilians. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1416.0s)]
*  They see them all as Hamas animals. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1416.7199999999998s)]
*  They have like repeatedly said that over and over again. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1419.4399999999998s)]
*  Yet still, we're sitting here pretending like Israel will ever care [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1423.12s)]
*  about anything related to an international law system that, quite frankly, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1427.04s)]
*  was created by America, by the Western countries, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1430.7199999999998s)]
*  only to be applied when it's useful against their adversaries. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1434.3999999999999s)]
*  But on that note, you know, I think that one important, I mean, there's so many things happening [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1439.6799999999998s)]
*  outside of Palestine, outside of, I'm sorry, Gaza, related to Gaza that aren't getting attention [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1445.1999999999998s)]
*  because obviously the worst atrocities of this genocide are taking place in Gaza [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1449.9199999999998s)]
*  and it kind of overshadows everything else. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1455.52s)]
*  But I just want to move for a moment to the West Bank, which hasn't been in the news as much as Gaza, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1457.52s)]
*  but you know, Israelis are committing violence there as well. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1462.32s)]
*  Almost, if not more at this point, I mean, as of the last number I saw, it was like 95, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1465.4399999999998s)]
*  but I'm sure that has already increased. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1469.76s)]
*  So let's just go with somewhere around 100 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1472.56s)]
*  since October 7th by either the Israeli military or actual lynchings by Israeli settlers, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1477.28s)]
*  which have not received attention. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1484.24s)]
*  And some of these settlers have actually recently been given assault rifles [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1487.12s)]
*  by the national security minister, this crazy right-wing guy, Edomar Ben-Gavir, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1490.1599999999999s)]
*  who bought 10,000 assault rifles to distribute to settlers, what they call civil defense groups. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1495.04s)]
*  But they're just like far-right vigilante groups to be used against Palestinians. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1501.76s)]
*  You have reported from the ground in the West Bank. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1507.1200000000001s)]
*  Can you tell us some of your reflections from that experience? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1510.8s)]
*  And then what is going through your head as you kind of like catch up on the news [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1513.76s)]
*  of what's happening there today? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1518.3200000000002s)]
*  I mean, it's so scary because there's massacres happening every day there, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1520.0s)]
*  like you mentioned, and everything that precipitated the attack on October 7th was [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1523.44s)]
*  bloodletting going on, an increase in settler terrorism, this complete fascist coalition of [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1528.88s)]
*  actual terrorists and fascists that have either been convicted for heinous crimes against Palestinians [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1535.8400000000001s)]
*  or just openly genocidal, stacked in the government, like Likudniks and Naftali Bennett. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1545.3600000000001s)]
*  You mentioned earlier this rhetoric coming out from the Israeli government being purely [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1552.3200000000002s)]
*  genocidal. I mean, this is the guy who said that they're committing self-genocide. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1556.8s)]
*  Here's what they're doing. Hamas is conducting massive self-genocide. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1560.72s)]
*  They're taking women and children, placing them next to missile launchers, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1565.04s)]
*  and shooting the missiles at Israel. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1569.12s)]
*  But these kids apparently were playing on a beach. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1571.04s)]
*  This guy is a maniac. Netanyahu is saying that they want telegenically dead babies for their cause. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1576.0s)]
*  This is the kind of rhetoric and Western media just sits back and they're like, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1583.04s)]
*  wow, that's so fascinating. Oh my God, tell me more. Have you ever heard something so cartoonish [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1586.08s)]
*  that they're committing self-genocide? But yeah, this guy, this harrowing footage of this guy [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1591.36s)]
*  handing out assault rifles, some assembly line to all of these fanatical settlers, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1597.9199999999998s)]
*  and they claim, oh, Palestinians are given money to go kill Jewish people. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1603.04s)]
*  No, dude, this is, again, it's like projection for what they're doing. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1607.52s)]
*  They're literally getting rallied on. Officially, the army is told, go just kill Palestinians, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1610.96s)]
*  these settlers. It's like, just go take them out because there's this, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1618.56s)]
*  basically not only a fog of war going on in Gaza with all of this Hasbro propaganda being unleashed, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1622.08s)]
*  but it's also creating this fog of war about what's going on in the West Bank. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1628.0s)]
*  There's essentially just a cloak. No one's looking over here, so now we can really ramp up our [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1631.68s)]
*  pogroms, the assaults on villages, the settler terrorism. They're going balls to the wall. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1637.6s)]
*  There was just 13 people killed in one village from probably soldiers and settlers because we [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1644.0s)]
*  know that soldiers basically just protect the fanatical settlers. You go over there with a [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1651.1999999999998s)]
*  tractor trailer, you perch up on top of an Arab village, and you just get immediately electricity [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1656.0s)]
*  and water hookups by the Israeli military and protected. That was my biggest takeaway. I think [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1660.9599999999998s)]
*  that that stark contrast is just really what people need to know when they think about the [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1665.92s)]
*  West Bank. The West Bank is under a military occupation. It's essentially martial law, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1670.64s)]
*  and fanatical settlers from all over the world can just go perch up on top of Arab villagers and be [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1676.72s)]
*  armed to the teeth and be protected. Palestinians not only can't have weapons, they can't have [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1682.24s)]
*  anything construed as a weapon. I remember I was in a car going through a checkpoint of a bunch of [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1688.16s)]
*  Palestinian guys, and they had all been, of course, everyone's in and out of prison for just [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1693.92s)]
*  arbitrary nonsense. I had a nail file in my purse, and the guy was just like, I could go back to [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1698.72s)]
*  prison. If they find this nail file and that can be construed as a weapon, I will go to prison. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1703.76s)]
*  I was just like, what? What? Yeah. When we were there, we were there for a month, and every day [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1709.1200000000001s)]
*  it was just countless stories of Palestinians being executed for this reason or that, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1716.3200000000002s)]
*  like some farmer was shot in the back because he didn't turn around quickly enough at an Israeli [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1722.96s)]
*  soldier giving him a demand. We go to the guy's funeral later, and everyone is traumatized. It [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1729.44s)]
*  was this horrifying thing. As we're leaving, the Israeli soldiers set up this huge blockade around [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1736.56s)]
*  the house and rerouted everyone to drive an hour, which would take you five minutes in a car, just [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1741.04s)]
*  to inconvenience everyone. On top of that, they were tear gassing the cars, shooting rubber bullets [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1748.3999999999999s)]
*  at just the funeral goers that had visited this house to pay respects to the living relatives of [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1754.48s)]
*  the man who was shot and killed. This is just every day in the West Bank, there's this going on. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1762.08s)]
*  We were at the Calandia checkpoint going from Ramallah into Israeli territory, and this man was [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1768.32s)]
*  walking with his hands raised. He obviously couldn't read the Hebrew sign saying, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1776.48s)]
*  don't pass this certain area. They just unleashed a barrage of bullets all around him. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1780.48s)]
*  They could have hit anyone in cars. They could have hit him. It's a miracle that he wasn't shot [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1785.68s)]
*  and killed. As we go through the checkpoint, the soldiers told me, be safe out there. Be safe out [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1790.72s)]
*  there. It's just like, dude, you guys are the ones making it completely unsafe. You are crazy. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1797.2s)]
*  What is going on? There's a million stories like that, Rania. I saw ambulances being stopped and [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1804.96s)]
*  checked. We know Hebron is just this nightmare where Palestinians are literally living in caged [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1810.72s)]
*  areas and Israelis just go and create this ghost town out of this bustling hub that used to exist. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1818.1599999999999s)]
*  It's just endless. I'm so terrified about where it's going to go under the cover of the war in [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1824.72s)]
*  Gaza. It's so crazy. Even just walking around, I'm wearing, constantly, I'm wearing pro-Palestine [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1831.84s)]
*  shirts and sweatshirts and stuff. Some little girl came up to me at the playground the other day. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1837.4399999999998s)]
*  She's like, yeah, she's like, did you know that Israel and Palestine are at war with each other? [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1842.0s)]
*  It's a little girl, so I know she- Yeah, you can't like yell at her. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1848.8s)]
*  But it's just crazy that everyone just thinks that. That Palestine and Israel, you just look [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1852.72s)]
*  at every mainstream media article, it's like the Palestine-Israel conflict, the Palestine-Israel [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1857.84s)]
*  war. They're literally just bombing a caged area. It is sick and depraved. It's unprecedented. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1862.24s)]
*  It's crazy and cutting off electricity and water for two million people. How is that a war? How is [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1871.28s)]
*  that anything other than genocide? Hamas is the governing body of Gaza. You could technically [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1877.4399999999998s)]
*  say everything is Hamas' wrong because I don't understand. The doctors are still doctors. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1883.44s)]
*  The hospital is still a hospital. Just because it's a public hospital doesn't mean Hamas militants [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1890.0800000000002s)]
*  are running it. I cannot believe the level of ... Maybe this is on me being very naive, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1895.8400000000001s)]
*  but the level of dehumanization is so shocking. Sorry, I had to play that because it's a real-time [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1903.76s)]
*  example of what we're all being subjected to hearing constantly. So I understand why that kid, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1909.6s)]
*  that girl at the playground is confused because she's just hearing her president say that all the [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1916.1599999999999s)]
*  time on the media. Yeah. And I understand why people are confused because Joe Biden literally [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1924.6399999999999s)]
*  said that he saw pictures of 40 babies beheaded. So when you have the president of the United States, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1929.28s)]
*  that ... When he said that, I honestly thought that Netanyahu showed him AI-generated images [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1936.64s)]
*  because I was just like, I don't put it past him to just concoct the evidence, but he didn't even [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1943.2s)]
*  do that. He didn't have to because Biden is just so stupid and his senility is just so obvious that [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1948.4s)]
*  he just ... He's just like weekend at Bernie's. I cannot believe that this is what we're dealing [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1955.52s)]
*  with. And hours after the hospital bombing to go and shake hands with Netanyahu and to ask for this [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1960.96s)]
*  unprecedented aid package while Israeli leaders are spewing genocidal rhetoric and incitement to [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1968.1599999999999s)]
*  genocide all over Western media and all of these IDF commanders are talking about why this operation [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1974.32s)]
*  is necessary. Can you imagine for a second if a Hamas commander or a Hamas militant was invited [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1979.52s)]
*  on the press to talk about why they feel like they need to do what they do? It's just ... It's [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1986.32s)]
*  egregiously ... The double standard is so crazy and it's just so obvious and I'm with you. I'm a [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=1994.08s)]
*  critic of Western media. We're around the same age. We've seen the last 20 years unfold since [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2001.4399999999998s)]
*  the war on terror and I truly like sitting back and looking at this incitement and this Islamophobia [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2007.84s)]
*  take root again, feeling like it's 9-12-2001. It's like, how have we not learned anything from [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2013.68s)]
*  the Iraq war? I thought it was kind of like a meme now that the media just lies, falsifies everything, [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2019.2s)]
*  manufactures consent whenever we want to go to war. It doesn't matter if it's Venezuela or Syria [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2026.24s)]
*  or Libya or Iraq or Palestine. This is what they do. They are an organ of the ruling class [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2031.44s)]
*  and they're subsidized by the defense contractors. How have we not learned anything? How have all [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2039.68s)]
*  these so-called well-intentioned liberals not learned anything? It's grotesque. It's sick [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2046.4s)]
*  and it's just ... The dehumanization is ... It's sick, Rania. All I see is dehumanizing genocidal [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2053.12s)]
*  things from Israeli leaders and there would be no misconstruing that if that were Arabs saying that [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2061.76s)]
*  about Jewish leaders. There would be no misconstruing that that was anti-Semitic [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2067.28s)]
*  and that it was incitement to genocide, calling people animals, saying that we are at war with [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2071.52s)]
*  civilians, that these people are sub-human, that they need to be wiped out. But that's just totally [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2076.88s)]
*  fine. That's completely fine when Israeli leaders say that and everyone just bends over backwards [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2083.6000000000004s)]
*  to rationalize it. I think Israelis know very well, this is just for an American audience. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2088.96s)]
*  This is literally just to make genocide palatable for American audience. That's why Biden [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2094.08s)]
*  needed some diplomatic cover about the hospital bombing. They know better, dude. They just need [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2098.3199999999997s)]
*  the veil of legitimacy so they can just keep throwing billions of dollars and weaponry to [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2103.6s)]
*  Israel. They know, but that's why Israeli leaders are all speaking English on American TV. They are [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2109.68s)]
*  selling it to us. Israelis know very well what's going on. Yeah. A lot of them are also sellers [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2115.7599999999998s)]
*  from the US and Australia too. That's why they speak English. But I think that this is a good [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2120.96s)]
*  segue into another topic I wanted to ask you about because you've also spent time on the ground and [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2126.08s)]
*  what is considered Israel. Israel is not a normal society. This is not to say that America is [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2130.08s)]
*  or that any other Western country is, but Israel is a very unique place because it's a 19th, 20th [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2137.76s)]
*  century style settler colony in 2023. And as a result, the basically entire Israeli public, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2145.44s)]
*  the vast majority of it is inculcated to hate and to essentially support the eraser of the [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2154.96s)]
*  indigenous people of that country. And as a result, you have a populace that is genocidal. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2161.68s)]
*  I'm not saying every single person is, but even journalists in Israel like Gideon Levy or Amir [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2168.7200000000003s)]
*  Haas will say they are in the extreme minority and that the vast majority of the country [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2174.64s)]
*  from across the spectrum supports ethnically cleansing Palestinians and killing them. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2180.96s)]
*  Our colleagues that lived in Palestine testify to that. David Sheen, for example, has embedded [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2189.12s)]
*  himself in these thousands strong fascist, openly fascist rallies that they'll be chanting death to [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2195.6s)]
*  the left, death to the videographers, referring to Bet-Solem videographers who just film atrocities [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2203.04s)]
*  sometimes on camera and dare to release them. And those people are considered the actual enemy. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2211.2s)]
*  There's a saying inside Israeli society that the left is like AIDS. And so yeah, no, it's crazy. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2216.8s)]
*  It's like you need to get rid of the left before you can get rid of what you die from when you [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2226.56s)]
*  have AIDS. It's like really, really dark. And I spoke to, you know, that was like just a pure [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2231.68s)]
*  organic sampling of Israelis on the street. A lot of people say that, oh, I maliciously cut that [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2236.56s)]
*  together. I purposely made Israelis look genocidal. No, that is just a random sampling of what Israeli [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2241.7599999999998s)]
*  society is like, right? I spoke to one guy later on in the video, one guy who said he is a leftist. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2248.24s)]
*  And I was like, well, what does that actually mean? And he said he just wants the occupation [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2255.52s)]
*  to be more humane. That's considered the left side of the spectrum there. And so it really is [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2259.04s)]
*  a fascist state, 100% fascist state. During the Trump administration, or like, I think it was like [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2265.68s)]
*  the 2016 election in 2020, like people were doing man on the streets there and everyone loved Trump. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2271.7599999999998s)]
*  Like everyone loved Trump. Everyone hated Bernie Sanders because he was seen as, you know, too- [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2277.7599999999998s)]
*  They hated the Jew. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2282.4s)]
*  He was a Jew. It's crazy. It's like you see this reflected in polling too. I mean, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2283.04s)]
*  during the Great March of Return, like the shoot to fire policy that killed hundreds of [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2288.56s)]
*  unarmed protesters and wounded thousands more with live ammunition, 95% of Israelis agreed with that, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2292.88s)]
*  Rania. Like when you have a society in lockstep supporting policies like that, you know, you can't [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2299.12s)]
*  really say the same thing about America. Yeah, we're a settler colonial state and there's plenty [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2307.36s)]
*  of blood on our hands for the genocide that took place here. But like, this is an active, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2312.8s)]
*  this is like active colonization happening daily where people are surrounded by like a [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2318.2400000000002s)]
*  milit- like a martial lawed walled off areas where Palestinians are just like living in apartheid rule [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2324.96s)]
*  and then 40, you know, 40 miles away from an actual like concentration camp. It's really surreal. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2331.1200000000003s)]
*  And you do have to have like, not just cognitive dissonance, but you do have to have hate in your [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2337.2000000000003s)]
*  heart born and bred into that indoctrination in order to be okay living there. Because American [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2342.08s)]
*  citizens, we don't all have dual citizenship. We don't have passports where we can just flee [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2348.24s)]
*  when we're disgusted with what our government does in our names, which I'm, you know, I wish that I [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2353.36s)]
*  had like a safe haven to go to to escape from this country. But Israelis do. That's why you see [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2357.52s)]
*  Israelis traveling all over the world. Like a lot of them have dual passports. A lot of them, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2363.52s)]
*  if you're an anti-Zionist Israeli Jew, like you just leave, how the hell could you live in that [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2368.08s)]
*  society? And a lot of the people that we know that are anti-racist Israelis do leave. And so it just [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2373.68s)]
*  continues to consolidate that racism and that hatred. And it's really unfortunate. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2379.44s)]
*  You know, I, you've kind of already mentioned, I was going to ask you about like the corporate [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2387.84s)]
*  media, but I think we've gone over some of how horribly they've covered this. And obviously just [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2391.68s)]
*  run absolute cover for Israeli atrocities, whether it's Hamas run health ministry, [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2397.12s)]
*  or just repeating talking points, or just covering October 7th nonstop, as if there aren't like 6,000 [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2401.84s)]
*  Palestinians who've been killed that we know of. But you know, I think there's something important [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2408.32s)]
*  to touch on here. And that is the fact that they aren't managing the narrative at all. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2412.96s)]
*  I would say, and I think polls show that Israel is losing the narrative war. Views are really [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2419.28s)]
*  changing. If you look at polls, especially the younger you get, like polls of like boomers are [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2426.32s)]
*  very much still in the pro Israel camp. Gen X is like, you get to millennials, you get to zoomers. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2431.52s)]
*  It's like a different story. It's more pro Palestine than not, especially if you pull just [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2436.96s)]
*  Democrats or people who, you know, call themselves liberal or progressive. There's no question. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2441.76s)]
*  And so, and I also, you know, I know that social media is an echo chamber, and it feeds you what [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2448.6400000000003s)]
*  you want to see. But even there, I'm just like, I'm seeing it's mostly pro Palestine content every [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2452.56s)]
*  once in a while, you know, I'll see like, an obnoxious right winger say something stupid. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2459.2799999999997s)]
*  But and I'm sure the right wingers are in their own echo chambers, too. But it does seem like views [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2464.32s)]
*  on this issue are shifting. Despite what CNN is trying to push into our brains. I'm curious, [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2469.84s)]
*  like what your thoughts on that are. Yeah, I mean, well, the hospital I keep bringing up the [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2476.56s)]
*  hospital bombing because it was such an egregious, disgusting rewriting of history real time and to [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2480.96s)]
*  see the Western media in tow, mindlessly regurgitating IDF spokespeople and press releases, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2486.8s)]
*  despite the clear manufactured evidence and doctored evidence that any Palestinian would tell you [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2494.16s)]
*  this is fake, like the audio recording that they released between alleged militants like this is [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2501.28s)]
*  fake. So the question is, why is Israel releasing fake doctored evidence? And shouldn't that just [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2505.84s)]
*  make you question the veracity and validity of what they are saying about the attack? [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2511.52s)]
*  And it was a disgrace, Rania, because that was like a moment that there was international [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2517.2000000000003s)]
*  outrage building and condemnation came really swiftly. And so they just reversed the narrative [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2521.36s)]
*  claim that Palestinians are blowing themselves up in the Western media just dutifully repeated it. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2525.76s)]
*  And it was just like, well, those idiotic Palestinians, they just can't stop blowing [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2531.44s)]
*  themselves up too bad, too bad. And we know damn well, it was a direct targeted [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2535.84s)]
*  with an air burst munition. And it's just sick, Rania, it's sick that now here we are again, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2545.04s)]
*  in the aftermath of that trying to like, explain this, that's the strategy, right, to confuse and [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2551.36s)]
*  obfuscate. But despite that, you're right, we have seen an incredible outpouring of especially [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2556.4s)]
*  Gen Xers who do not believe this, I think that they are completely detached from whatever the [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2565.2000000000003s)]
*  corporate media is selling. We know that people like Tucker Carlson, for example, his audience, [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2569.6s)]
*  even though it was the most widely watched show on TV, it was a lot of boomers, right. And the [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2573.44s)]
*  younger you are, the more the less inclined you are to watch corporate media, the less inclined [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2578.96s)]
*  you are to get your news from corporate media. And you see that severe detachment from like the [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2584.4s)]
*  Israeli stronghold on the narrative. And it's very encouraging because I have been out in the streets [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2589.84s)]
*  for the last two weeks and I have seen unprecedented historic demonstrations in Oregon [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2596.4s)]
*  for Palestine solidarity. It is amazing. And a lot of these actions were Jewish led. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2602.1600000000003s)]
*  And I met my Jewish friends there, colleagues who were, you know, radicalized on birthright. And now [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2608.2400000000002s)]
*  they're out marching in the streets. And a lot of Jewish activists are leading the way here with [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2613.36s)]
*  the historic demonstrations in the Capitol getting arrested. It's amazing because I was so worried [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2618.1600000000003s)]
*  at the beginning of the chilling effect on solidarity actions because of representatives [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2623.44s)]
*  like AOC and, you know, people kind of finger wagging at Palestine demonstrations that [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2627.92s)]
*  immediately erupted saying these are essentially celebrating Hamas. I mean, it was really, really [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2634.7200000000003s)]
*  disgraceful what I saw at the beginning. And I was super worried that we were going to see a [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2640.96s)]
*  quell and a chilling effect on people wanting to come out in the streets. And look what we've seen [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2646.32s)]
*  now, tens of thousands. I mean, in the UK, it was like a hundred thousand. It was like one of the [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2650.2400000000002s)]
*  largest demonstrations in history in that region. And here, I mean, I thought the Sheikh Jarrah [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2655.6800000000003s)]
*  stuff in 2021 was like, I mean, that was a moment where I was like, this is huge. This is [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2662.7200000000003s)]
*  unprecedented. This momentum is unstoppable. And now it's like 10 times bigger, Rania. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2668.16s)]
*  They cannot stop it. And that's why they've implemented all this anti-BDS legislation [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2673.7599999999998s)]
*  around the country because they know the tide of justice is coming. They know the tide of public [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2679.68s)]
*  opinion is turning. And that's all Israel has really banked on for the last 20 years, especially [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2684.48s)]
*  because before it was like, you know, the intifadas, there was like a lot happening on the [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2689.92s)]
*  ground. And then ever since they essentially besieged Gaza into this concentration camp, [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2695.28s)]
*  it's really hard to justify these ongoing massacres of just bombarding a caged ghetto [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2700.6400000000003s)]
*  and cutting off electricity and water and putting Palestinians on a diet on the brink of this [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2706.32s)]
*  humanitarian crisis and not letting people leave. It's really hard to justify that. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2710.32s)]
*  And so what they've done, even though they have Western media as their, you know, as their like [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2714.7200000000003s)]
*  parodying, you know, appendages, they still have deployed millions of sock puppets and they have [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2720.24s)]
*  war rooms at Tel Aviv University where people are just paid to correct the record on Wikipedia, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2726.7999999999997s)]
*  to argue with people online, to monitor social media. This is what they do because they know [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2732.16s)]
*  that the public opinion is the most important thing that they have going for them. And that's [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2738.56s)]
*  why, you know, we've talked about Israeli society, everyone's on board with the ethnic cleansing and [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2743.2s)]
*  the genocide there. That's not really who they're trying to appeal to. They're trying to appeal to [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2747.2s)]
*  Americans because they know that America and America's green lighting of this and America's [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2751.2s)]
*  subsidization of Israeli apartheid is the only reason why it survived. And that's who they're [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2755.7599999999998s)]
*  gearing this Hasbra propaganda to, this barrage of lies. So every, you know, online, especially in [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2762.24s)]
*  the last two weeks, everyone seems fake. Every time I look at people's accounts, it's like newly [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2768.72s)]
*  created, looks completely fake. I mean, it's kind of pathetic to think that we're giving Israel [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2774.16s)]
*  billions of dollars and they're probably just spending it on literally nothing but paying [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2779.04s)]
*  people to be like sock puppets. Yeah, full salary with benefits for anybody who's willing to troll [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2782.48s)]
*  Abbey Martin online. Like it's actually, it's actually happening. It's crazy. You know, I do, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2788.72s)]
*  though, I think you made a really good observation about at least how a lot of us were feeling after [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2795.2799999999997s)]
*  October 7th. Like I guess the sentiment in the Middle East was a bit different because obviously [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2800.56s)]
*  I'm operating in a very different environment here. But I did look to the U.S. and think, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2805.2s)]
*  oh, wow, people there are just like gonna, you know, condemn Palestinians and not protest when [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2809.36s)]
*  Israel bombs back. And they did. And I was really like, it warms my heart to see how many people do [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2815.92s)]
*  care because it gets very easy to think nobody does. But I just want to, I do want to talk about [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2822.08s)]
*  Hamas for a moment because, you know, we're supposed to view Hamas as this like evil ISIS [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2826.56s)]
*  like group, right? With the new talking point that's coming out now. And I'm not saying Hamas is [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2833.52s)]
*  perfect or angels. And I'm saying that as somebody too, who like, like ideologically, I'm not like, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2837.92s)]
*  you know, a fan of Hamas is like a branch of the Muslim Brotherhood. They're very like religiously [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2843.52s)]
*  right wing. You know, I definitely didn't agree with what they did in Syria, for example, but [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2847.52s)]
*  they are at the same time they exist for a reason. They exist as a resistance to Israel's genocide [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2854.0s)]
*  against Palestinians. And that's first and foremost what they are. And people under occupation do [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2858.7200000000003s)]
*  actually under international law have the right to armed resistance. And that's constantly denied [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2865.44s)]
*  to Palestinians constantly, no matter who's doing it all throughout the history of Palestinians [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2872.0s)]
*  fighting for their survival. They've been accused of being terrorists, whether it was left wingers, [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2877.2000000000003s)]
*  like the PFLP, or whether it's like, you know, the religious right like Hamas, they're always [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2882.88s)]
*  going to be accused of being terrorists. I mean, we know they're accused of being terrorists, [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2888.6400000000003s)]
*  even when they're just marching without weapons. You know, they're if they send balloons over the [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2891.52s)]
*  border, they're called terror balloons. Like Palestinians existing is like a form of terrorism [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2896.08s)]
*  for Israel, literally. But on the subject of, you know, of Hamas specifically, I'm curious, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2901.2000000000003s)]
*  like your thoughts when you do see Biden and Netanyahu call them ISIS? [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2907.44s)]
*  Right. I mean, it's, it's fascinating, because going back to what we were saying about the [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2913.6s)]
*  initial narrative, they wanted to essentially just equivocate Hamas and ISIS, because I think that [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2918.2400000000002s)]
*  they saw what the US did to alleged ISIS fighters, which was completely level, entire parts of the [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2925.28s)]
*  Middle East, and the civilian casualties were just an afterthought. And it was like, well, [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2932.1600000000003s)]
*  the primary goal is to take out this, you know, maniacal terrorist organization who's burning [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2935.84s)]
*  people into cages. And it's just horrifying crimes that you can't even comprehend really medieval [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2941.44s)]
*  type shit. But what's amazing is that they couldn't, you know, that's why you saw the 40 [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2945.92s)]
*  beheaded babies. That's why you saw the mass rape, you saw a lot of dehumanizing barbaric [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2952.48s)]
*  talking points that were put out to try to dehumanize Hamas, even beyond ISIS. I mean, [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2957.2000000000003s)]
*  I've never heard of any group in modern history beheading infants, right? That's a pretty egregious, [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2962.48s)]
*  crazy thing to put out there. But of course, uncritically parroted by the Western press on [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2968.88s)]
*  the front page of New York Post. I mean, just around the world, I'm sure probably like a billion [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2974.16s)]
*  people saw that and cemented that as truth. And that was the intent from the gecko was trying to [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2978.64s)]
*  put that in people's minds that Hamas is as barbaric, if not more barbaric than ISIS. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2984.48s)]
*  But of course, all of that unraveled, Rania news organizations quietly had to retract those claims [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2990.0s)]
*  because they were completely false. There was no reports of rape. There were no reports of [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=2995.52s)]
*  beheading infants. And you even saw Israeli authorities posting Hamas is worse than ISIS. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3000.48s)]
*  And also pictures that they claimed were ISIS flags. Like in the attacks, I mean, can you imagine? [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3008.32s)]
*  I just want to say something about that real quick. Yeah, please. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3015.44s)]
*  Think about that real quick. Do you know how many flags Hamas has to have on them before they get to [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3018.48s)]
*  the ISIS one? If they even they would never have it. They actually fought ISIS in Syria, [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3024.7200000000003s)]
*  right? And Al Qaeda as well. At one point, at least ISIS branch there. But like, they've got to [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3029.76s)]
*  have the Hamas flag, they've got to have the they've got to have the Palestinian flag. There's like a [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3035.52s)]
*  bunch of other ones they've got at the Al Qassam brigades, like, for them to just oops, we left [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3041.76s)]
*  our ISIS flag and says like, is just is as dumb as the Israeli claim and also as made up as the [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3047.6000000000004s)]
*  Israeli claim that they found Hamas instruction manuals. Because you know what I what anybody [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3054.0s)]
*  in a military operation does is they have a pocket instruction manual in their pocket, [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3058.96s)]
*  like to look out in case they forget what they were supposed to do. And they accidentally drop [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3064.5600000000004s)]
*  it. Like it doesn't it's not even logical what they're saying. And then to add to all that, [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3068.56s)]
*  you've got these like, the fact that all of this, all of these testimonies are coming out from [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3073.6s)]
*  Israelis being like, Oh, yeah, our side shot us. Like, it's becoming increasingly clear that a lot [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3078.48s)]
*  of these people died, because there was crossfire because the Israelis have something called the [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3085.12s)]
*  Hannibal directive, where they would rather kill their own people than allow them to be taken [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3090.16s)]
*  hostage and use this leverage in a prisoner exchange. So like, that's happening. And on top [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3095.04s)]
*  of that, you have this woman or these women who were these elderly women who were like released [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3100.4s)]
*  by Hamas from Gaza on humanitarian grounds that Israel didn't even want back. Like, [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3106.16s)]
*  yeah, well, though they don't want the back actually Hamas apparently there was a report [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3115.12s)]
*  that Hamas had suggested will release 50 hostages, if you send fuel to Gaza for the hospitals. And [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3118.4s)]
*  the Israelis were like, No, they don't even want their own hostages. Right. Yep. And these women [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3124.16s)]
*  are released. And the woman gives like a press conference in Israel, where she I'm sure you saw [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3128.96s)]
*  it was like, crazy. She was like, Yeah, they were really nice to me. They fed me. They ate with me. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3133.92s)]
*  They gave us shampoo and conditioner to shower with. And like, yeah, they were really kind. I [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3139.8399999999997s)]
*  mean, it was hard when they took us. But like, after that, they were really nice. Yeah, they're [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3144.16s)]
*  like, why did you shake his hand and say shalom? And she was like, because we talked about a lot [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3148.56s)]
*  of stuff. And they were super nice. Just the stories that you that are coming out from the [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3152.08s)]
*  kibbutz that were attacked are just like crazy. It's like Israeli gunfire barrage of bullets [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3156.7999999999997s)]
*  for the crossfire killed all the hostages. They don't care about the hostages. But it doesn't [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3162.16s)]
*  stop the celebrities, Rania and all of the Western tenants from having this mantra free the hostages, [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3166.4s)]
*  free the hostages and then even Israel's posting like, bring them home. Bring them home. Well, [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3173.52s)]
*  that's what you can today. You know, the only hostages who have died have been killed by [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3178.8s)]
*  Israeli bombs. Yeah, like, I think a couple dozen and they just they don't care. Like, if Amy Schumer [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3185.1200000000003s)]
*  wants to like lead a letter signing campaign to free the hostages, she should send it to Netanyahu. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3192.0800000000004s)]
*  Because I want to say something else about Hamas too, because they I hear this constantly that [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3196.4s)]
*  Hamas is directive and their charter says that they want to wipe all Jews off the map and [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3202.8s)]
*  destroy Jews. And and this just constantly like how Biden is saying the attack on October 7th is [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3208.4s)]
*  as consequential as the Holocaust, that it's the deadliest attack on Jewish people since the [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3214.1600000000003s)]
*  Holocaust. Like, I mean, that is such loaded, crazy rhetoric, making it seem like Hamas's [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3219.44s)]
*  directives are anti semitic. It is an occupied people, they are under siege. They're directing [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3225.76s)]
*  things toward their occupiers. Like, if I were Israeli, and if I were Jewish, I would be directing [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3234.64s)]
*  my anger at the Israeli government for having a policy in place that is the root of all of the [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3240.96s)]
*  violence, right? Everything that happens, the root cause is the siege and is the occupation. So it is [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3246.56s)]
*  just so insulting to our intelligence to be told that this is all about anti semitism. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7qndyvmEE&t=3252.3199999999997s)]
