**BreakThrough News - Palestine:** [October 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_4wJMm3KEs)
*  And just speaking to what might be happening behind the scenes, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_4wJMm3KEs&t=0.0s)]
*  you know, are there any discussions about or negotiations related to a potential ceasefire? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_4wJMm3KEs&t=3.68s)]
*  We've seen the call for a ceasefire growing in certain parts of the world. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_4wJMm3KEs&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  People really do want to see an end to this bloodshed. So is that, you know, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_4wJMm3KEs&t=16.96s)]
*  is that something that's being discussed at all right now? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_4wJMm3KEs&t=21.68s)]
*  Well, there are some political contacts, but seriously, the Israelis are rejecting everything. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_4wJMm3KEs&t=25.28s)]
*  They believe they can do what they want. And by the support of the United States, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_4wJMm3KEs&t=33.6s)]
*  they are more encouraged to do that. Anyway, they have tried to do that years ago. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_4wJMm3KEs&t=40.24s)]
*  All the history of the Palestinians was like this, and they couldn't overcome the Palestinians. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_4wJMm3KEs&t=47.28s)]
*  They have invaded Lebanon in 1982, and they thought for a while that they have overcome [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_4wJMm3KEs&t=52.64s)]
*  the Palestinian resistance. Well, they found themselves fighting Hezbollah, and they, at the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_4wJMm3KEs&t=58.8s)]
*  end, left. They were kicked out, in fact, from the Lebanese lands, most of the Lebanese lands. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_4wJMm3KEs&t=65.76s)]
*  They will find themselves all the time facing the resistance of the Palestinians, and they [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_4wJMm3KEs&t=73.6s)]
*  will find themselves in the hands of the Palestinians. And I believe if they continue like this, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_4wJMm3KEs&t=81.44s)]
*  this resistance will not stay only a Palestinian resistance. I have to remind everyone that once [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_4wJMm3KEs&t=88.16s)]
*  in the history, everyone was helping the Palestinians to resist Israel. And now this is supposed [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_4wJMm3KEs&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  to happen. Everyone is talking to us. Everyone wants to help, and we are keeping talking to [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_4wJMm3KEs&t=103.11999999999999s)]
*  us. We are still standing. The Israelis have to understand they can't continue as an occupation. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_4wJMm3KEs&t=109.44s)]
*  And the Israelis and Americans seem to be involved in this rhetorical game of chicken with Iran, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_4wJMm3KEs&t=115.76s)]
*  as well as Hezbollah. Do you foresee this war in Gaza escalating into a regional war? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_4wJMm3KEs&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  Well, this is in the hands of the United States and Israel. If they continue the massacre in [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_4wJMm3KEs&t=132.72s)]
*  Gaza, they have to expect all the scenarios. No one can expect what may happen next. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_4wJMm3KEs&t=138.24s)]
*  A few minutes before bombing the church, everyone's talking in another direction. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_4wJMm3KEs&t=145.68s)]
*  After bombing the church, we are talking in another direction. But the simple idea, which [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_4wJMm3KEs&t=151.28s)]
*  I believe everyone has to understand, why to talk about the details while you can talk about the beef? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_4wJMm3KEs&t=158.8s)]
*  The beef is the occupation. I have to make an effort to see the situation. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_4wJMm3KEs&t=167.92s)]
*  I think this will open a good future for everyone. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_4wJMm3KEs&t=173.28s)]
