# Israel is a Racist, Supremacist State
**BreakThrough News - Palestine:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0)
*  Israel is one of the most racist countries in the world. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=0.0s)]
*  While you'll never hear anyone in the mainstream media say this, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=2.6s)]
*  this is actually one of the most important things you need to understand if you want to know what's happening right now. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=5.4s)]
*  From its inception, the whole idea of Israel as a country was based on racism. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=18.6s)]
*  Israel was conceived as a Jewish state, and while there's nothing wrong in principle with Jews having a homeland, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=23.2s)]
*  the problem is that they insisted that that homeland had to be in Palestine, which already belonged to someone, the Palestinians. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=29.0s)]
*  The slogan of Israel's founders was, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=35.6s)]
*  a land for a people for a people without a land. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=37.2s)]
*  But deep down, they all knew that the only way to have a Jewish majority in Palestine, in Arab country, was to expel the Arabs. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=39.8s)]
*  One of the founders of Israel, Yosef Weitz, wrote, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=47.0s)]
*  There's no room in the country for both peoples. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=50.0s)]
*  There's no way but to transfer the Arabs from here to neighboring countries. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=52.6s)]
*  Israel was quite literally founded by expelling and massacring hundreds of thousands of Arabs in a years-long process called the Nakba. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=56.2s)]
*  And when you've found a country based on racial exclusion, you're gonna get a culture that fosters and celebrates racial exclusion. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=63.8s)]
*  Because countries that commit terrible atrocities rarely acknowledge committing those atrocities, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=71.0s)]
*  and the presence of Palestinians who remained in Palestine became a constant reminder, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=76.0s)]
*  not only of the violence that founded Israel, but of the constantly looming threat that they might come back and try to reclaim their land. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=81.8s)]
*  Every day you can find videos coming out of Israel showing Israelis calling for all Arabs to die, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=88.6s)]
*  insulting the prophet Mohammed, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=101.6s)]
*  We are the ones who are afraid. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=106.0s)]
*  We are the ones who are afraid. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=108.6s)]
*  desecrating mosques, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=111.2s)]
*  The Quran is a thief. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=112.4s)]
*  spitting on Christians, mocking and celebrating the murder of Palestinians, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=113.6s)]
*  committing violent hate crimes against Palestinians, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=118.0s)]
*  watching Gaza get carpet bombed from a cliffside for entertainment. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=121.0s)]
*  But don't just go off these anecdotes. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=125.4s)]
*  Let's look at some of the polls. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=127.6s)]
*  One poll found that two-thirds of Israeli teens believe Arabs to be less intelligent, uncultured, and violent. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=129.4s)]
*  It also found that 50% of Israelis wouldn't live in the same building as Arabs, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=135.8s)]
*  wouldn't befriend Arabs, wouldn't let their children befriend Arabs, and wouldn't let Arabs into their homes. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=140.0s)]
*  Another poll found that 60% of Israeli Jews want segregation from Arabs. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=145.8s)]
*  Another poll found that half of Israeli Jews agree with the statement, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=150.8s)]
*  most Jews are better than most non-Jews because they were born Jews. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=154.20000000000002s)]
*  The poll also found that 88% of Israeli Jews would be disturbed if their son befriended an Arab girl, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=158.0s)]
*  and 90% would be disturbed if their daughter befriended an Arab boy. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=164.0s)]
*  This poll found that about half of Israeli high schoolers don't think Arabs should have the right to vote. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=168.0s)]
*  Another poll showed that almost half of Israeli Jews don't want Arabs teaching their kids. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=173.0s)]
*  Not only are these views widely held in Israeli society, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=178.0s)]
*  they're also represented in government, which codifies these sentiments into law. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=181.4s)]
*  For example, Israel is a law that says if an Israeli marries a Palestinian, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=185.8s)]
*  or someone from several other regional Arab states, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=190.0s)]
*  that person isn't allowed to move in with said Israeli. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=192.6s)]
*  This law was passed in 2003, but it's been renewed every single year since. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=195.79999999999998s)]
*  Israel also doesn't allow inter-religious marriage to be performed in the country, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=201.2s)]
*  which is meant to deter Jews from marrying non-Jews. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=205.2s)]
*  In 2018, Israel passed the nation-state law, a law which has constitutional status, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=208.2s)]
*  which says the right to exercise national self-determination, i.e. have rights, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=213.6s)]
*  is the exclusive right of Jews, no one else. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=218.6s)]
*  There's also the Nakba law, which makes it illegal to acknowledge the Nakba, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=222.0s)]
*  the expulsions of Palestinians that were needed to found Israel. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=226.4s)]
*  This would be like passing a law to make it illegal to talk about indigenous genocide or slavery in America. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=229.4s)]
*  There's also the admissions committee law, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=235.0s)]
*  which basically allows towns to operate panels that deny applications for entry based on sociocultural compatibility, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=237.0s)]
*  which essentially just legalizes racist housing discrimination. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=244.8s)]
*  In Israel, advocating genocide of Palestinians doesn't hurt your chances of holding a high position in government, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=248.4s)]
*  and in fact, in many cases, it helps. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=254.20000000000002s)]
*  In 2014, Israeli lawmaker Eilat Shaked wrote an unhinged rant on Facebook, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=256.6s)]
*  calling all Palestinians enemy combatants and saying their mothers should be killed for giving birth to, quote, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=262.4s)]
*  little snakes. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=268.4s)]
*  The next year, she was appointed to Minister of Justice by Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=269.4s)]
*  Itamar Ben-Gavir, a lifelong admirer of Merikahan in Arab Exterminationist, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=274.2s)]
*  a man who praised a Jewish settler who killed a Palestinian for throwing a rock at him, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=279.4s)]
*  a man who was famously acquitted after being criminally charged for chanting death to Arabs, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=284.2s)]
*  is Israel's current Minister of National Security. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  He's not some fringe figure either. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=293.0s)]
*  He's one of the most popular politicians in Israel right now. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=295.0s)]
*  In the last few days, Israel's been working hard to cast itself as the victim. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=298.4s)]
*  The victim of hatred, the victim of terrorism, the victim of anti-Semitism, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=303.0s)]
*  that they have no choice but to lay siege to Gaza. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=307.6s)]
*  But underneath this carefully concocted victim complex is a racist Jewish supremacist state [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=310.6s)]
*  that's been trying to finish the job that the Nakba started for decades. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=317.0s)]
*  And really, this shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=320.8s)]
*  After all, they're literally cutting off water and electricity to a city of two million people right now. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=324.0s)]
*  Their generals talk openly about flattening Gaza and killing the animals, meaning Palestinians. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=330.8s)]
*  It's obvious their goal is genocide. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JzGzyaUnz0&t=336.8s)]
