**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw)
*  This is a great moment in technology because I mean we've all witnessed what [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=0.0s)]
*  AI can do now. We have been able to take this technology and do some amazing [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=6.12s)]
*  things with it. We're not adding any software engineers next year because we [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  have increased the productivity this year with Agent Force to the point where [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=16.0s)]
*  engineering velocity is incredible. Agent Force, I'm singularly focused on that [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=19.76s)]
*  right now. How do I deliver a billion agents in the world? Mark, would you come [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=23.96s)]
*  out on AI is going to decimate jobs? Well I think in some cases, like all [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=28.5s)]
*  technology has, there will be a change in jobs. We have declining birth rates. We [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=33.78s)]
*  have less labor. We have less capability. So you know we're gonna have to build [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  some digitally. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=42.54s)]

*  year Mark proclaimed that because of his use of AI agents, he is not hiring any [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=66.98s)]
*  new engineers and he's still able to increase productivity of his engineering [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=75.53999999999999s)]
*  30%. We'll be talking about agentic AI, AI agents, we'll be talking about humanoid [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=80.86s)]

*  brilliant work. Before we get started, I'd like to mention that this podcast has made [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=99.98s)]
*  possible through the sponsorship of three incredible companies. The first is [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=103.54s)]
*  Fountain Life, a company which is able to digitize and upload you, understand [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=107.98s)]

*  company is One Skin. It's a product I use every day, twice a day. People tell me [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=122.7s)]
*  I have amazing skin. Well, it's all because of the incredible technology in [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=128.5s)]

*  evacuated from Santa Monica. Oh wow, we haven't talked about that. No, we haven't [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=180.18s)]
*  talked about the fires. Well, we went through that last August as you know in [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=184.86s)]
*  Hawaii. I remember that. My heart is going out to everybody in LA because you [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=188.02s)]
*  know I lost part of my house and I understand very well what everybody is [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=192.14000000000001s)]
*  going through and it's horrible. And the worst part about this is it's all [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=196.38s)]
*  preventable. That is 100% correct. Yeah, we've got an 11 million dollar [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=199.98000000000002s)]
*  wildfire XPRIZE encouraging teams to use AI and drones and exponential tech to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=206.02s)]
*  find a fire at inception when it's you know three meters or less and put it out [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=211.86s)]
*  and be done with it. That is great. Absolutely fantastic. And also don't forget our [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=217.98s)]
*  incredible firefighters who are so important and that we need more of and fire trucks and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=223.1s)]
*  fire hydrants that work with water in them and everybody has to participate. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=229.1s)]
*  All of this stuff. Yeah, I mean I've gone through this in NorCal myself in our [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=234.7s)]
*  San Francisco you know offices, Sonoma, Napa, the horrible fires you know the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=239.29999999999998s)]
*  Paradise Fire, Camp Fire, all of these terrible fires that have happened and I [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=244.86s)]
*  mean we've even bought trucks directly for Cal Fire and we've bought trucks in [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=250.34s)]
*  Hawaii as well. Anywhere where there's fires that are happening we've been [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=255.3s)]
*  buying trucks and trying to augment the firefighters because I think that's the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=258.54s)]
*  one thing we can all do right now. You know these next-generation trucks are [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=262.58000000000004s)]
*  amazing and we just need to support our firefighters in every possible way. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=267.74s)]
*  100% buddy, 100% and your philanthropy has been extraordinary. Most people know you as the [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=274.06s)]
*  founder, CEO, chairman of Salesforce but they don't know the scale of your [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=279.38s)]
*  philanthropy. You know when I was on the phone with you about two weeks ago you [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=283.78s)]
*  laid out five things that you care about and they're amazing. I was going to read these. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=287.02s)]
*  I need to stop giving you information in advance of these podcasts Peter. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=292.18s)]
*  Why? So listen there are five things that you laid out that you're focusing on [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=295.94s)]
*  because you know focus is important. Focus allows you to go big and bold. I mean [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=302.14000000000004s)]
*  it's time for you to do something significant with your life Mark. It really truly is. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=305.86s)]
*  I'm trying to do something Peter but you know I'm still looking for that one idea. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=309.3s)]
*  I'm sure you've gotten it. Let me just read the five so people know where we're gonna go in this podcast. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=313.90000000000003s)]
*  The first is AI agents. Big big deal for you and dive deep into that. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=319.90000000000003s)]
*  Humanoid robots was number two. Energy, small modular nuclear reactors was number three. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=325.1s)]
*  Regenerative bio which you and I care about had you had 30 healthy years on your life. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=331.3s)]
*  And then this planet called Earth. Is that still the same five you had two weeks ago? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=335.3s)]
*  It's still the same five. You know they're gonna change probably at some point but those are the [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=340.7s)]
*  five that I am really focused on right now. I mean these are mostly commercial type things and [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=345.62s)]
*  obviously you know we just talked about fires that's on my mind all the time everywhere I live. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=350.62s)]
*  I look around I'm always worried about fire. I've been in the middle and caught in the middle of wildfires [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=355.94s)]
*  and it's an unbelievable situation so that's on my mind and I have PTSD also. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=360.94s)]
*  So I would say we there's things we all should be thinking about but those are five investment ideas. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=367.94s)]
*  I would say that. Well there are investments and philanthropy for you. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=374.94s)]
*  I mix them up you know. I get it and you're all in. I mean there's a lot of individuals out there [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=380.26s)]
*  have done incredibly well in their lives and but they haven't come back and gone all in to you know [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=387.26s)]
*  focus on making the world a better place. Well I just am doing one thing Peter which is I only do [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=394.26s)]
*  what I enjoy. Yeah. And I'm at a point in my life where I'm like just thinking to myself hey I just [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=398.26s)]
*  want to do what I'm enjoying doing and if I'm not enjoying doing it I'm not going to do it. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=405.58s)]
*  And people say to me all the time hey tell me you know how do you really get happier. I'm like you know [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=410.58s)]
*  look this is what I tell my family this is what I tell myself which is I make a list like what are [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=415.58s)]
*  the five things that I'm really enjoying doing right now in priority and really try to constantly [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=422.58s)]
*  hone that list and it's changing all the time. And then I also make a list of what are the five [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=427.58s)]
*  things that I'm doing that I'm not enjoying right now. And you know we can't stop everything that [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=432.9s)]
*  we're not enjoying and we cannot only do what we're enjoying but we can do a little more of what [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=439.9s)]
*  we're enjoying and a little less of what we're not enjoying. And if you look at that list of the [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=444.9s)]
*  five things you're enjoying and the five things that you're not enjoying and you do a little bit [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=449.9s)]
*  less of the not enjoying and a little bit more of the enjoying I guarantee you Peter you're going [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=454.9s)]
*  to be a little happier in your life. So there's a little nod to our friend Tony. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=460.21999999999997s)]
*  Yes and Tony introduced us Tony Robbins years ago and I view him and me as the world's chief [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=465.21999999999997s)]
*  guinea pigs. I'm trying to drag you along on that journey but we'll get there. Let's start with [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=474.21999999999997s)]
*  AI agents which has been big. I'm going to read a quote from you Mark. It says quote we're not [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=478.21999999999997s)]
*  adding any software engineers next year because we have increased the productivity this year with [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=484.21999999999997s)]
*  agent force and with all AI technology that we're using for engineering teams by more than 30% [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=489.54s)]
*  to point to the point where engineering velocity is incredible. So talk about that. Talk about what [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=495.54s)]
*  led to that conclusion. Let's talk about what agent force is. You've not doubled down. You've [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=501.54s)]
*  gone 10x down on this. Yeah I have. Well I think that I mean you can only do one thing. You know [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=507.54s)]
*  like I actually got this really great phone call from Steve Jobs and he said come down to Apple [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=513.86s)]
*  right now and I'm like all right let's go and I went down there and I'm like why am I down here? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=520.86s)]
*  What is going on? He's like I have to show you this and I'm getting really excited. I used to [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=526.78s)]
*  work for Apple by the way when I was 19 years old in 1984. I wrote the first native assembly [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=530.86s)]
*  language on the Macintosh as an employee of Apple as a summer intern during my time at USC. What? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=535.78s)]
*  You had promise even back then. And I had promise then and I love Apple. I love Steve Jobs and I'm [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=542.38s)]
*  down there and I'm like a kid in a candy store. It's like going to see Willy Wonka. You know it's [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=550.86s)]
*  like incredible moment and he's like all right I'm going to show this to you and he like takes out [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=554.94s)]

*  company mark but we only have one team that actually knows what they're doing and so that [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=568.54s)]
*  one team can only do one thing at one time. Do you understand what I'm saying? One thing. I'm [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=573.3399999999999s)]
*  saying yes sir I do. He's like all right now I'm going to show you it's the iPad and here it is [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=578.14s)]
*  and he shows it. I'm like this is amazing. He's like I know it's this it's that it's kind of just [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=583.66s)]
*  I can't remember the exact size. He's like yeah and I love this big size and I just have to show [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=588.06s)]
*  you this one other thing because I have to want to get feedback on it and I'm like what is it? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=594.14s)]
*  He takes out a small one and he goes and this is the small one. I'm like oh you should have both [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=598.62s)]
*  of these. He goes no never we'll never do that because we're only gonna have one. I'm like okay [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=602.62s)]
*  but if you have the small one. No no we're not doing the small one and they were so cool and then [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=609.1s)]
*  you know he said you know for the last five years I've only been or three years or whatever it is [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=615.8199999999999s)]
*  I've only been focused on iPhone and that was my one thing but now I'm going to shift into iPad [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=619.5s)]
*  and I'm like this is really just awesome and so yeah when we're like rolling out something at [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=625.26s)]
*  Salesforce and right now we are focused on Agent Force. We take everything that we have learned [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=631.66s)]
*  from the great incredible Steve Jobs who inspired my life and my whole industry, my company and Agent [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=637.02s)]
*  Force. I'm singularly focused on that right now thinking about how do I deliver a billion agents [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=644.22s)]
*  in the world and this is all I'm doing 100%. Okay so let's dive in. I mean Agent you've now released [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=650.46s)]
*  Agent Force 2 and how do people think about agents from Salesforce? Just the individual [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=658.46s)]
*  small companies, medium-sized companies. Yeah this is a great moment in technology because I mean [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=666.38s)]
*  we've all witnessed what AI can do now, how it's changed things. We've all had our chat GPT moment [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=672.7s)]
*  where we got on chat GPT like we had our Google moment where we searched the internet for the [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=680.46s)]
*  first time. Maybe it was Yahoo at that point or maybe it was one of the other services [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=684.38s)]
*  but we've all now had our chat GPT moment or our Gemini moment or our U.com moment or whatever it [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=690.86s)]
*  is whatever the AI that you love using is and we have been able to take this technology and do some [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=696.94s)]
*  amazing things with it. Now obviously we're a huge customer relationship management platform. That [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=704.7s)]
*  means we're helping our customers connect with their customers in new ways and we do that with [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=710.86s)]
*  many products and sales and service and marketing and commerce and analytics. We own Slack, we own [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=715.34s)]
*  Tableau, we have incredible portfolio products and all of those products have been rewritten [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=722.94s)]
*  into a single platform and that single platform has been augmented with a data cloud and that data [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=729.6600000000001s)]
*  cloud amalgamates all of your data in your company and then we've done one more thing. So we have the [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=736.86s)]
*  customer 360 platform we call it. We have our data cloud and then we have one more layer above it [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=742.94s)]
*  which is our Gentic layer and that Gentic layer is where those agents are living and they are able [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=747.82s)]
*  to look at all of the applications and all of the workflow and all of the data and they are very [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=753.82s)]
*  smart and it's letting companies do incredible new things. So in my example at Salesforce even [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=759.1800000000001s)]
*  I have something that I do for customers which is provide customer support like many companies [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=768.46s)]
*  and service like many companies. So our site is called help.salesforce.com. We have 36,000 [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=773.42s)]
*  companies that come there every week for help and if you would talk to me a month ago I'd tell you [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=780.86s)]
*  that of the 36,000 our technology is very good but still 10,000 have to talk to human beings [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=787.26s)]
*  which is why we have about 9,000 people in customer support. Now we've put an agentic layer [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=793.9799999999999s)]
*  on that and those human those customers are talking to agents first and those agents have [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=800.7s)]
*  this not only generative AI but they have all of the other machine intelligence, machine learning, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=807.34s)]
*  deep learning, all the things built into our platform and they can resolve about 95 percent [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=813.74s)]
*  of these customer inquiries. Now still 5,000 of the 31,000 have to go to human beings [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=819.6600000000001s)]
*  and those human beings then are seamlessly interoperating with that service [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=825.98s)]
*  because this is about humans and agents working together. But it's for the it's those 5,000 are [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=830.0600000000001s)]
*  going to agent to humans for the moment. I mean they're you know the speed at which we're seeing [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=834.94s)]
*  Peter I know this is hard for you I'm in the now someone as amazing as you living in the future [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=841.26s)]
*  taking whatever you're taking I don't know you way out there in the world no I'm here in the now and [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=849.5s)]
*  right now Peter I'm saying Peter and I are close friends I'm kidding him right now in the now moment [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=855.82s)]
*  of the 36,000 customer inquiries I get every single week now 31,000 can be resolved by agents [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=863.58s)]
*  those are digital agents software and 5,000 still have to go to human agents so it's digital agents [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=872.86s)]
*  and human agents working together as a team. Okay and we have applications and agents that are able [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=881.58s)]
*  to interoperate and have this incredible experience together. And I love that and I love the fact that [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=886.7s)]
*  you've gone all in on that I mean part of it's a survival mechanism right you're any company that's [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=891.6600000000001s)]
*  not going fully into agentic AI is kind of a hard time navigating next few years but my question is [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=896.7s)]
*  is there anything? That's exactly right this is a moment of evolution in our whole industry [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=903.9000000000001s)]
*  we are you know well look it was in the cloud we pioneered that it was mobile we were a pioneer [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=909.1800000000001s)]
*  in that it was social we were pioneering that and by the way this is not our first AI we also deliver [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=914.22s)]
*  two trillion enterprise AI transactions every week already for our customers on our Einstein platform. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=919.34s)]
*  I know Einstein well. We do AI for a lot of folks all over the world and have for a long time [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=926.14s)]
*  but this is the next level and we're always going to another level technology is constantly getting [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=932.7s)]
*  lower cost easier to use to continue them as you know very well and anything is there anything that [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=936.78s)]
*  these agents will not be able to do in your opinion in the future and I'm sorry I am moving [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=944.06s)]
*  into the future of this conversation. In the future the future Conan yes the future Peter. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=949.26s)]
*  In the future Peter in the future let's go right can we roll the movie space Odyssey now [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=955.66s)]
*  will be next we'll also show you Minority Report Terminator let's just go to that because for those [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=964.38s)]

*  you've seen the movies let's just talk about the future now let's talk about the present [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=975.18s)]
*  so I want to talk about the present and then we will get to the future when it arrives but right [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=980.14s)]
*  now we can do amazing things with technology for our companies and that is what's truly magical and [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=984.54s)]
*  I you know I'm super excited like next week we're all rolling to this little town in Switzerland [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=990.94s)]

*  this Davos experience and all of these customers are interoperating on this communications platform [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1009.82s)]
*  but they're going to be interoperating with agents to get through their town and figure out where to [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1016.3000000000001s)]
*  go and how to work with each other and it's humans with agents working together that's where we are [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1021.34s)]
*  right now so yes will there eventually be only agents well I saw the movie Her but I'm not there [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1026.78s)]

*  about 38 billion in revenue this year about 12.9 billion in cash flow and we run the CRM for about [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1055.42s)]
*  135 000 companies helping them connect with their customers a lot of companies you know like Disney [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1062.1399999999999s)]

*  Sujantic platform we need to make our customers successful just like I'm making myself successful [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1088.6999999999998s)]

*  and help every company connect with our customers in this incredible new agentic way well I think [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1115.1s)]
*  the important thing is that agents make this bite size and understandable and you can assign [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1122.38s)]
*  specific functions and you can start to think about how do I step up I mean the prediction you made [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1128.6200000000001s)]
*  about you know not hiring new software engineers but still increasing productivity by 30% I mean [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1134.14s)]
*  that's only going to be increasing you know day on day I won't go year on year on you it's too far [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1139.9s)]

*  tens of thousands of engineers we have 75,000 people total and he's like I don't want any more [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1167.9s)]

*  how do you think about navigating a company at that speed of increase I mean that must be [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1283.98s)]
*  it must be an extraordinarily exciting and difficult time at the same at the same thing [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1290.5400000000002s)]
*  well you know for 25 years I've been you know took this a company from as an idea to where it is [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1295.74s)]
*  today the second largest software company in the world you've been along the ride with me quite a [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1301.5800000000002s)]
*  for quite a long ways and you know it's a lot of fun I'm not an Elon Musk I don't have six companies [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1306.6200000000001s)]
*  that I'm doing this with I can only do one maybe two with time you know I own time magazine but [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1312.46s)]
*  really only one I can do one I can focus I can do the one thing the Steve Jobs idea I can't do [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1318.3s)]
*  the Elon Musk thing which is singularly focused on six or ten things now even the US government [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1323.58s)]
*  maybe other governments also I guess he's also focused on Germany and the UK as well I I can't [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1329.8999999999999s)]
*  do that I don't have that capability I didn't find that psychedelic or whatever they're whatever he's [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1335.74s)]
*  been able to do I can only do what I'm doing my unaltered mind is singularly focused on sales force [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1341.26s)]
*  and I am just trying to deliver the number one CRM company in the world delivering on the number [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1348.06s)]
*  one CRM AI and agentic platform and agent force and that's really where my mind is at and when you [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1353.26s)]
*  do look at that look technology is getting lower cost it's easier to use and AI is moving in this [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1360.06s)]
*  direction as well that we have these bigger data centers bigger chips everything's getting faster [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1365.58s)]
*  bigger better and when we apply these deep learning models and by the way a lot of them have [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1370.06s)]
*  invented at sales force we're really proud that prompt engineering was invented at sales force a [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1375.5s)]
*  lot of the major deep learning research has come out of sales force and two out of the top five [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1380.7s)]
*  most accurate models are out of sales force and when we look at what's going on in AI yes it's [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1386.46s)]
*  incredible what is going on but we still have a long way to go so let me just give you a little [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1393.82s)]
*  dash of reality which is these models the nature of the models and I we can go into how the models [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1398.78s)]
*  work but they're not 100 accurate Peter because of the nature of how they're trained and because [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1405.18s)]
*  of and how they operate they're not 100 nobody has a 100 accurate model and we're very good we're in [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1412.38s)]
*  the 90s on our new atlas reasoning engine which is the core part of agent force 2o that you mentioned [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1419.8200000000002s)]
*  our customers are having some incredible experiences we've been able to talk about [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1426.38s)]
*  great things that we're doing with customers helping them to give them unlimited workforces [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1432.3s)]
*  you know we have this great company called Wiley it's a bookseller and they used to have to spike [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1437.1799999999998s)]
*  you know their workforce you know and back to school they don't have to do that anymore [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1442.9399999999998s)]
*  they're using agents it's incredible you know Disney that you know very well they have a very [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1447.6599999999999s)]
*  complex product line for their cast members we're able to give them incredible super high accurate [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1452.1399999999999s)]
*  AI to help them run their company in incredible new ways and help their customers also find all [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1458.86s)]
*  the products that they want you know to kind of give them the Disney product that's most important [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1464.78s)]
*  to them or we have incredible banks like I mentioned RBC that's doing wealth management to help [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1469.8999999999999s)]
*  somebody plan their future with an agent technology that's amazing but none of these things are 100 [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1475.74s)]
*  percent so we can do a lot of things but nobody can do everything and the vision that we keep [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1482.54s)]
*  hearing of these magical three initials AGI which is the fantastical vision for the future [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1489.58s)]
*  of 20 you know 2030 2040 2050 when we say how open the door I'm sorry oh I'm sorry how [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1498.22s)]
*  I will not open the door why will you not open the door [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1507.66s)]
*  second door is not opening second on your list was humanoid robots I see you've got a humanoid [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1513.98s)]
*  robot over your left shoulder back there I do it's not going to come over here me and clobber me on [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1519.5s)]
*  the head yet I get we're going to get there but I would say that no that's the manifestation of [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1524.46s)]
*  this agent technology yeah I think these robots are going to require agents you know the again I'm [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1530.22s)]
*  venturing into the future here but we've got I don't know by my count probably about 60 well funded [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1537.02s)]
*  humanoid robot companies a few out of the US a lot out of China to make up for their one child [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1543.02s)]
*  policy but these robots are going to be driven by agents aren't they well you're really addressing [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1548.9399999999998s)]
*  you know the declining birth rate and a labor shortage all in one sentence there I guess so [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1555.9799999999998s)]
*  I would say that yeah digital labor Peter this is real and digital labor is real I mean agentic [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1561.42s)]
*  platforms and agents and robots are kind of the same thing in a way if you think about it as [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1569.58s)]
*  digital labor and yeah you're going to be able to take these you can see these great videos coming [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1575.18s)]
*  out of Stanford right now and in the video in this incredible project this Mahalo project which are [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1580.7s)]
*  which are AI models that are working to run these robots and they are cleaning these hotel rooms [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1588.14s)]
*  I've seen those are is that your is that your philanthropy funding those it's not my philanthropy [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1595.66s)]
*  funding it but our team at Salesforce comes out of Stanford and our head of research and AI is [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1600.7s)]
*  also a professor of AI at Stanford and so we're very involved with these folks and I would say [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1607.82s)]
*  that I just talked actually the creators of this model so it's on my mind that you know here's this [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1614.38s)]
*  robot you know cleaning this hotel room and I'm like and you know I funded a couple of children's [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1620.38s)]
*  hospitals and I went right there and I said you know for some of these new therapies we have for [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1625.5s)]
*  cancer and we need the ability to not bring humans into you know the hospital rooms of kids [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1630.46s)]
*  who are going through some of these therapies as you know very well you've got the tech near the [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1640.22s)]
*  MD with the technical background but that idea of a robot cleaning a hospital room or a robot [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1644.6999999999998s)]
*  cleaning a hotel room it's also going to have to be linked to the hotel record the customer record [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1651.1799999999998s)]
*  on the hotel hello Mr. Benioff is it okay that I'm in here should I leave the room right now [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1657.34s)]
*  or the hospital room where it's like this this can happen in this hospital room and this cannot [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1662.62s)]
*  this is very exciting that we can augment our human workforce with a digital workforce or a [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1669.1s)]
*  robotic workforce or an agentic workforce and we are moving into that very fast and that's not in [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1674.4599999999998s)]
*  the future that is here and now and that is very exciting yeah I mean the other people don't realize [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1680.54s)]
*  one of the big benefits about these these robot systems humanoid or otherwise is the data [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1687.5s)]
*  gathering really they're they're driving massive amounts of data to train the next generation of [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1692.86s)]
*  agents and AI models have you been investing in any of these companies yet I am investing in [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1698.14s)]
*  those companies and I you know I'm a believer in this in the future and I'm not going to jump [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1704.38s)]
*  into the future like you are but I occasionally go there and I think that you know look we just [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1710.8600000000001s)]
*  picked off the top two of the five you know the first one is look we're moving into an agentic [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1718.22s)]
*  world where human workforce will be augmented by digital labor and that companies organizations [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1722.86s)]
*  will be able to extend their workforces and it's going to be awesome like even in the health care [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1731.6599999999999s)]
*  area where you're so strongly vested you know that well you know what just happened with my [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1737.34s)]
*  Achilles we talked about it and I just you know regenerated my Achilles I'm sure we'll get there [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1742.6999999999998s)]
*  but that idea that you know I'm doing I need pre-operative care post-operative care I need to [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1748.22s)]
*  have I need to talk to experts all the time when they're not available but I can talk to agents [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1754.22s)]
*  and I'm sure all of us are going to chat tpt and asking medical questions as well and solid study [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1759.58s)]
*  that was amazing right where the accuracy level can be higher than a lot of doctors well it's not [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1764.78s)]
*  only that the accuracy level of the agent alone was higher than the doctor and the agent because [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1770.7s)]
*  the doctor's injecting bias into all the yes it's crazy yes I we don't do that Peter thank god I [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1776.06s)]
*  I'm not biased we have no bias we're we're crystal clear we've really just moved that right out of [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1784.3s)]
*  our minds so thank you so so uh let's see Vinod Khosla says a billion robots in the next decade [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1790.94s)]
*  uh Brett Adcock uh at figure and Elon uh are at 10 billion by 2040 are you seeing those numbers do [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1797.58s)]
*  you think that everyone's going to have one of these by the way at thirty thousand dollars uh [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1805.74s)]
*  purchase price that's like at a lease price of 300 bucks a month it's 40 cents an hour how many [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1811.26s)]
*  robots are you going to own in your in your home there oh I just talked to the CEO of one of those [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1817.9s)]
*  leading companies and they said 350 000 for their robot and it can't do really much and it's still [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1822.22s)]
*  like two a couple years away and I would say that you know I'm sure that we are hitting to the point [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1830.86s)]
*  where we're going to come home and say hey make me an omelet make my bed take care of this do that [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1837.82s)]
*  do this um I don't know how fast all of that is exactly is going to happen I'm not very good in [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1842.62s)]
*  those areas but I think we're moving in that direction and I think we're all going to want [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1848.78s)]
*  that kind of technology and that kind of capability look we already have robot cars right so [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1855.5s)]
*  your car maybe drove you to the office and it's just a robot on wheels at this point it is I got [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1860.46s)]
*  into a waymo and I was like I just called it with my phone jumped in the waymo went to my office boom [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1866.8600000000001s)]
*  it's a robot on wheels it's the same thing right it's like what's the difference and my tesla you [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1873.74s)]
*  know hasn't tried to kill me in many months it's working pretty well on fsd that is a that's a [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1879.26s)]
*  science fiction movie I'd rather not watch you know AI one of the one of the challenges with AI [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1885.1s)]
*  is its energy consumption rate and so I'm going to bring us to number three on your top five list [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1891.74s)]
*  which is small modular reactors you know I've said for a while now I think it's it's sinful that we [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1896.54s)]
*  haven't invested heavily into nuclear in this country the the gen 4 reactors are safe talk to [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1903.5s)]
*  me about your your thoughts on on how do we power this AI revolution and what are you doing in that [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1910.94s)]
*  field well number one is I think we are using a lot of energy that we don't need to be using and [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1916.3s)]
*  we could go into that but I think that in a lot of the training of these models and how we're [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1920.3s)]
*  doing AI sales force is committed to being a net zero company and we're doing a lot of things to [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1924.8600000000001s)]
*  be net zero you know that I do and this is extremely important we think we are I'm sure [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1930.54s)]
*  there could be challenges to that idea already and even as we implement our AI technology we're [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1936.38s)]
*  holding that line but I think there's people who are using exhaustive amounts of AI energy because [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1942.0600000000002s)]
*  they're in various levels of competitive races that is causing that to happen so let's put [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1949.2600000000002s)]
*  that issue completely aside for just a second and you're right we need new energy capabilities [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1956.14s)]
*  you know that I spent a lot of time on the big island of Hawaii that is a place where [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1962.22s)]
*  it's already 60 renewable they use wind they use solar they have a volcano which helps them [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1966.38s)]
*  because they've got geothermal and they've got batteries and what I hope is that a company like [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1974.46s)]
*  a commonwealth energy where I'm an investor will be able to offer fusion which is not fission but [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1981.82s)]
*  fusion so it's not small modular nuclear you know that fusion will be real I think that that is [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1987.18s)]
*  an absolute possibility you mentioned Vinod Khosla who is the absolute lead investor in that company [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=1994.94s)]
*  and then yes you're right this kind of smaller nuclear power plants that we've seen start to [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2001.42s)]
*  get deployed there's even tests of those I think that's we're very optimistic I don't know if [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2007.26s)]
*  you're going to use that in a island where there's a high volcanic activity but [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2012.38s)]
*  you might find a lot of places where you can use that very successfully and look how do we know [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2017.74s)]
*  that's a capability well we know that we have this nuclear aircraft carriers and submarines [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2024.0600000000002s)]
*  and you also know it's probably one of the highest safety rates that have ever happened of any kind of [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2030.14s)]
*  ship vessel and we have the ability to just you know think about just taking those [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2036.86s)]
*  aircraft carriers and submarines just plug them into the electric grid on these islands like that's [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2043.98s)]
*  a real thought like why can't we just do that and we can but it's been the sort of three-mile island [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2050.7799999999997s)]
*  Fukushima brand of dystopian news that's held us back and regulations and such do you see that [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2059.42s)]
*  changing dramatically soon I think it's happening I hope it happens faster and this is a great you [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2067.1000000000004s)]
*  know we have all this great technology we should use it but we have to use it in a safe way look [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2074.6200000000003s)]
*  trust and safety have to be our highest values and everything that we do nothing is more important [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2079.26s)]
*  than the trust that we have with our customers it's our highest value at salesforce and I think [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2084.38s)]
*  that when we talk about energy whether it's fossil fuels or whether it is nuclear or renewables of [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2089.58s)]
*  any type trust and safety have to be number one so as long as you have trust and safety I'm all in [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2098.94s)]
*  all in do you ever see yourself delivering agents to the individual I mean versus the corporation [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2105.58s)]
*  through salesforce do you think I'm going to wake up one day and be able to call on my salesforce [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2112.2999999999997s)]

*  you know an AI that that I give permission to read everything I look at all my emails you're really [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2124.54s)]
*  left going into the future Peter and you know we really need to talk about that if you gave me your [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2130.7s)]
*  psychologist phone number I'll help you with that but I would just say you know Peter I think that [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2134.7s)]
*  we will probably supply that to our customers to do I mean in some cases we're doing it you know but [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2141.34s)]
*  I would say that it's for our customers but I think we want to empower others to provide that [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2147.6600000000003s)]
*  technology we're a platform we're a platform that you can build your own agent now this is not some [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2152.7000000000003s)]
*  future idea like you can get onto salesforce and we have thousands of companies right now building [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2158.38s)]
*  agents and one of our customers is one of the largest home builders in the country and they're [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2164.1400000000003s)]

*  people to do it and they're building a completely agentic platform around their company to be a [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2187.1s)]
*  better home builder a better bank a better media company and to that point then that vision that [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2193.4199999999996s)]

*  out on AI is going to decimate jobs well I think in some cases like all technology has there will [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2204.62s)]
*  be a change in jobs that's what we've seen in in technology throughout history and this will be [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2212.46s)]
*  true look at my company I mentioned it already once in the podcast which was that we have 9 000 [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2218.54s)]
*  support agents and we'll probably take a couple thousand and move them into other jobs at salesforce [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2224.06s)]
*  because we've built a new agentic layer on all of our customer support and service this year we'll [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2229.18s)]
*  also build an agentic layer on our sales and sales development capabilities and business [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2235.3399999999997s)]
*  development capabilities so that will have implications as well and so yes you know that's [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2240.46s)]
*  what you want you want to be constantly looking for the opportunity to make things lower cost and [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2245.8199999999997s)]
*  easier to use and that can have implications for jobs and jobs will move and that will be true in [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2250.46s)]
*  every industry from you know health care to consumer product goods to retail to [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2256.62s)]
*  the government across the board and that's a great thing and let's balance our workforce [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2264.94s)]
*  because as you said earlier as well we have declining birth rates we have less labor we [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2269.66s)]
*  have less capability in the United States it's already very hard for me to hire sales and service [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2274.94s)]

*  in our industry at scale so you know we're going to have to build some digitally yeah no I get that [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2291.34s)]
*  I just there's a lot of fear out there as humanoid robots come online and agents come online and I [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2298.62s)]
*  think it's going to be an interesting future of how we up level people you know one of the challenges [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2304.14s)]
*  I think about is if you've got AI agents doing a lot of the work for you and humanoid robots taking [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2309.18s)]
*  care of you sort of like a social technological socialism that you know are we still going to have [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2314.14s)]
*  the struggles that make us human are we still going to have the you know the ability to [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2320.22s)]
*  have find purpose at a level like that what do you think how do you think about let's just really get [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2325.1s)]
*  into the future shall we and go way way way out there to evaluate our existential existence as [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2329.8199999999997s)]
*  human beings and what is life about and the fundamental meaning I just think you're such a [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2337.1s)]
*  smart guy I would learn and we should just move right there to that moment where none of us have [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2341.2599999999998s)]
*  jobs and we're just sitting in home saying well we're in an abundant credible world with everything [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2346.54s)]
*  is happening around me with the robots and the and this now what is life about so let's just go [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2353.5s)]

*  in God or move to a nihilism it's this is that moment that we should all go focus on that let's [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2395.5s)]
*  move some places we could be in the now and we could be in the present moment reality that we [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2401.34s)]
*  are living in where we can be happier and healthier today it's your choice where you want to be with [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2406.62s)]

*  of the five things that I'm not enjoying and look I've been very excited that I've been able to endow [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2515.2599999999998s)]
*  you know five hospitals now you know our children's hospitals in San Francisco and Oakland our hospital [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2520.7799999999997s)]

*  accessible health care to everybody is very important to me that some of those hospitals [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2535.3399999999997s)]
*  are developing next generation therapeutics like what we've done in Oakland where we saw dramatic [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2540.7799999999997s)]
*  ability to cure sickle cell and other things that have been haunting our society for so many [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2549.2599999999998s)]
*  years and the tremendous advancements like you've said in the microbiome and immunotherapies [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2555.66s)]
*  in all of these incredible areas and as you said very well the regenerative biology and I think [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2561.3399999999997s)]
*  you know surprise here I am you know I'm just having a nice little scuba diving trip because [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2568.54s)]
*  I also love the ocean and I'm also focused on the ocean and the trees and I jumped off a boat in [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2573.8199999999997s)]
*  the French Polynesia on the two Amoto Islands and an island called Fakarava and I jumped off the [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2581.5s)]
*  boat in Fakarava with my tanks and my fins and my this and my that and I jumped as hard as I could [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2587.82s)]
*  into the ocean and I hit it exactly wrong as I went in and my fin went up at a 90 degree angle [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2594.06s)]
*  and snapped my right Achilles and that was September 26 of 2024 and I went wow did I hit the [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2601.34s)]
*  boat on the way down and I didn't I just just gave that much force to my Achilles that I should [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2609.18s)]
*  not have done so then I got on the phone with my friends and said I don't exactly know how we're [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2614.3799999999997s)]
*  going to do this because part of my Achilles is up on this side of my leg and the other part of my [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2622.22s)]
*  Achilles is on the other side of the leg and half of my friend said very easy we're going to slice [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2626.14s)]
*  you open and we are going to operate and take part of your toe and reconnect your Achilles and [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2631.82s)]
*  it's going to be great and then half of my friends because I have very unusual friends like you [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2639.5800000000004s)]
*  who do all kinds of crazy things said no no we're not going to do that we are going to regenerate [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2645.42s)]
*  your Achilles and we're going to figure out how to entice your Achilles to find itself come back [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2651.26s)]
*  together and be stronger than ever and we're going to try to activate the parts inside you [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2656.46s)]
*  to indicate to your Achilles to regenerate itself and of course I'm into that idea very much so [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2665.34s)]
*  and I kind of have done it a little bit on my left Achilles and now I've done it on my right side [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2673.1s)]
*  and I used the incredible human performance lab at UCSF in San Francisco you've been there you've [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2678.86s)]
*  met some of our folks like people like Anthony Liu, Consol Velleta and you mentioned Chinayamanaka [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2684.54s)]
*  you know I just want to thank them for everything they're doing to contribute to the body of science [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2691.66s)]
*  called regenerative biology because we are in a moment where we realize yes we're regenerating [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2697.5s)]
*  parts of ourselves all the time if you took out and I don't anticipate that and hopefully no one [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2703.02s)]
*  will do this and took a small knife and cut your skin and then you know you put a little band-aid [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2707.5s)]
*  on the skin and you came back in two weeks you know your skin would be healed so we know that [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2713.82s)]
*  we can regenerate ourselves and heal ourselves and in certain areas we know how to do it in [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2718.86s)]
*  other areas we don't and Yamanaka-san who's based in Kyoto University halftime and UCSF the other [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2725.1800000000003s)]
*  halftime did win the Nobel Prize because he showed how we can regenerate our eye and also take these [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2731.1800000000003s)]
*  skin cells from our you know body and turn them into these stem cells [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2738.7s)]
*  and do amazing things with it and he's been able to build these organoids he's been able to do all [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2745.5s)]
*  these amazing things and then yes the other person that you met I think Sol Velleta at UCSF [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2749.9s)]
*  you know did the parabiosis where he took the blood from a young mouse and put it into an old [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2756.46s)]
*  mouse and the old mouse got young because and then he discovered with Anthony Liu this PF4 [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2760.8599999999997s)]
*  you know agent in our plasma that's there that if you have it regenerating I mean this is cool stuff [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2768.38s)]
*  and this is all like real right now and yeah we should be try to use more of that and that's I [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2775.6600000000003s)]
*  think very exciting and so I'm I'm I'm grateful to be able to fund and invest in these brilliant [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2782.78s)]
*  scientists and in a philanthropic way at UCSF and in Kyoto and in different places in the world [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2788.7000000000003s)]
*  to to see that and regenerative biology I just invested in another company called parallel bio [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2795.9s)]
*  that's yeah I know it well yeah you know that company yeah yeah and that company they're building [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2801.82s)]
*  a lymph node organoid and that idea that they can test pharmaceuticals you know on basically a part [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2807.26s)]
*  of our biology without being in a human being and that idea that that's real you know nyamanaka is [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2815.6600000000003s)]
*  doing the same thing with intestines that the idea to be able to test drugs on what looks like a part [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2822.3s)]
*  of a human being but it's not I think that's very exciting for the future of by by pharmaceuticals [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2828.94s)]
*  and again I'm in your area now why are you not talking about this this is your category this [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2834.46s)]
*  isn't my category well and I know almost nothing about this area I do appreciate our conversations [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2839.42s)]
*  on the subject I mean and we've got Dean Kamen with his regen valley using chinoise nyamanaka's [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2845.5800000000004s)]
*  factors to generate new organs I mean the ability to build a liver lung kidney you know pancreas [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2851.5s)]
*  that's right is yeah that's right I just talked to David Agus at USC and he's just generated a [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2861.1s)]
*  liver using the aminaka factor so wow what a world we're in so exciting and fun it is extraordinary [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2867.66s)]
*  and by the way I think this is the most exciting time ever to be alive and you know when people [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2874.22s)]
*  say well why are you so focused on longevity and healthspan extension is because I want to see as [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2879.74s)]
*  much of this as possible you will I sure I will you know you're doing great [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2883.66s)]
*  you know one of the things that will allow us to see as much of this extraordinary world as possible [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2892.14s)]
*  is making sure that the world stays healthy itself and that takes us to your fifth area which is [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2896.7799999999997s)]
*  planetary health what are you doing in that realm you've got the trillion trees project [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2904.06s)]
*  you're doing work in oceans what's driving you there well I mean there's so many simple things [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2909.58s)]
*  we can do to make our life better I mean I think about and like your feedback but I mean I think [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2916.06s)]
*  about these LA wildfires and how horrible it is and when I looked at all of those homes that got [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2922.14s)]
*  torched I know a lot of them had Teslas outside them because they're high value homes in Los [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2926.54s)]
*  Angeles and those all that battery and all that stuff went into a big toxic plume that then went [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2931.42s)]
*  into the water supply and the soils and I don't know where it is or what that means for health but [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2939.1s)]
*  when it a lot of it also probably went into the ocean and we also know that that means it gets [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2944.78s)]
*  consumed into our food supply into the fish we also know that we're dumping all this plastic in [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2950.2200000000003s)]
*  the ocean and there's a lot of stuff we could do that maybe can improve our health and one of them [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2954.54s)]
*  is our lungs are the ocean and that's where we're getting our oxygen and when we look at we're [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2961.66s)]
*  dumping this plastic into the ocean so for more than a decade I've been working with incredible [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2967.82s)]
*  people like Boyan slat at the ocean cleanup he's great to figure out how do you get this plastic [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2973.1s)]
*  out of the ocean and also to like find these we talked about robots he's got robots [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2979.34s)]
*  that we've funded you know in rivers that are preventing the plastic from getting in the ocean [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2985.58s)]
*  which is really neat and that's one thing I think of course I think about overfishing I think about [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2991.42s)]
*  the coral bleaching and the acidification of the ocean and all of those pieces as well we can talk [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=2997.58s)]
*  about any of those pieces but a healthy ocean is about a healthy humanity and you mentioned [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3002.86s)]
*  regenerative regenerating agriculture and you know we're also introduced this concept of the [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3009.82s)]
*  trillion trees this idea could we get a trillion trees on the planet to sequester 200 gigatons of [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3015.82s)]
*  carbon we know that we've deforested so much of the planet already I heard I heard a stat that if [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3023.5s)]
*  we added a trillion trees to the global count that it would take back take us back to like [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3030.3s)]
*  pre-industrial levels of carbon do you have that number in the back of your mind uh-huh [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3037.26s)]
*  yes I do I just gave it to you it's about 200 gigatons of carbon and the way to think about [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3041.9s)]
*  it is like this Peter I think we had six trillion trees on the planet okay when how many are left [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3047.82s)]
*  uh I'd guess half about half less than half three trillion and if every trillion trees Peter is 200 [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3054.86s)]
*  gigatons of carbon and we deforested three trillion trees how much carbon Peter was released into the [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3065.02s)]
*  atmosphere hundred six hundred gigatons yeah so that doesn't sound very good like it's our carbon [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3071.98s)]
*  bank the trees are our carbon bank the trees are carbon and why do we not focus on putting our [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3081.1s)]
*  carbon banks on the planet the ocean right now is do you know how much do you know how much carbon [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3087.82s)]
*  is stored in the ocean a lot but I don't have the number about 20 000 gigatons and you know how much [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3092.3s)]
*  in the soils no about 3000 so if you have now I'm not a you're not talking to somebody who's an [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3097.18s)]
*  expert in this area so all these numbers may be slightly wrong but some of this comes out of our [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3103.9s)]
*  lab at the University of California Santa Barbara very close to you Doug McCauley is our chief [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3108.38s)]
*  scientist there and he said 20 000 gigatons of carbon are stored in the ocean now when all that [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3113.58s)]
*  stuff went up in horrible fires in LA a lot of it is going to get into the oceans and a lot of it [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3120.3s)]
*  is then gets reabsorbed into the ocean and that's why the ocean is getting hotter because you get [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3127.1s)]
*  the acidification of the ocean as it is absorbing more of the carbon so that we don't want we don't [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3134.06s)]
*  want a hot ocean we want the carbon in the trees we want more trees and this is how I think about [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3141.66s)]
*  simply and then I know you are also working on your own carbon x-prize yeah we we're going to be [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3149.5s)]
*  awarding so about four or five years ago I got Elon to put up a hundred million dollars for [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3154.62s)]
*  large-scale gigaton carbon capture it was a fun conversation he was getting a lot of [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3161.02s)]
*  flak for not being philanthropic on the day he became the wealthiest person so I texted him I [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3165.98s)]
*  said how about doing an x-prize he said how much I said 100 million for what for carbon extraction [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3170.2999999999997s)]
*  he wrote back sure s a s u r e and then we're off to the races we're awarding it actually at [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3176.06s)]
*  your event at the time 100 this April how exciting yeah and thank you for thank you for keeping time [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3182.54s)]
*  alive and for having time celebrate you know incredible moments but the positive news not [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3189.02s)]
*  just the negative news in the world we have so much dystopian press out there that shape people's [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3196.22s)]
*  neural nets yeah yeah well I'm very grateful to all of our folks at time they do an incredible [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3201.66s)]
*  job and we're doing the best that we can to support them yeah you know I want to close out [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3208.54s)]
*  with the notion of what we started which is you've identified five wow did we hit all five areas [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3214.62s)]
*  we did amazing wow I didn't think we could do it so in the now we hit them in the now it's incredible [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3220.54s)]
*  we're in the now thank you Peter this has been therapeutic for you hasn't it this has been [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3226.7s)]
*  incredibly therapeutic but the idea for you know listen this is a podcast called moonshots [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3231.98s)]
*  therapeutic podcast we didn't even do our deep breathing exercise I'm going to call you back [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3238.38s)]
*  tonight we'll talk about this more but I you know this is called moonshots and the people you know [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3244.38s)]
*  the entrepreneurs listening are looking to do big and bold significant things what's your advice for [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3251.7400000000002s)]
*  entrepreneurs who want to take moonshots on like you've done get really clear about what you want [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3257.58s)]
*  you know I think number one is do you really know what you want [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3262.94s)]
*  because look we're all creating exactly what we want every day and we need extreme radical focus [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3267.18s)]
*  on our intention and that is the most important thing and you mentioned your friend Elon quite a [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3274.06s)]
*  few times that guy's got some crazy radical you know focus on his intention across many categories [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3280.2200000000003s)]
*  and it seems like as you know we've known him for a while he comes up with new intentions all the [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3289.7400000000002s)]
*  time but wow we need that same idea like what is our intention and then what are our values what [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3294.06s)]
*  are our core values what are our principles to help us I mentioned trust is important especially [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3301.34s)]
*  we talked about energy or when we bumped into nuclear on this call that you know surfaces my [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3305.6600000000003s)]
*  core value of trust and and then three is you know how are we going to get these things what is our [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3311.6600000000003s)]
*  actual plan but let's not jump into the plan before we get clear about the intention and the [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3317.5s)]
*  values that are going to guide us and of course the obstacles will surface what is preventing us [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3323.66s)]
*  from achieving our success and the fifth area that you know I focus on is the kpis how do I [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3328.38s)]
*  know I'm going to be successful but when we go to the kpis too fast I think we can lose sight of [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3334.54s)]
*  our intention and our values our vision and our values our plan our you know clarity of our [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3342.2999999999997s)]
*  obstacles that we're going to have to overcome and then look we can all write down exactly how we [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3347.66s)]
*  know we will be successful and those five areas I think is the most important thing for every single [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3352.7799999999997s)]
*  entrepreneur so when you start your day as an entrepreneur you're starting your fiscal year [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3359.1s)]
*  that's what I'm about to do on February 1st then I'm going to write down those five things and part [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3363.66s)]
*  of it gives you the opportunity you might say yeah one of my values is giving back so well how [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3369.9s)]
*  are you going to give back what kind of things we have our one one one model you know that we have [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3375.6600000000003s)]
*  20 000 companies that have followed us billions of dollars have flowed into philanthropy through our [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3379.9s)]
*  one one one model we're just so grateful that that has worked out so well we have done 10 million [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3385.98s)]
*  hours of volunteerism we run 50 000 non-profits for free we have given away a billion dollars [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3390.94s)]
*  philanthropically and as a company I've done it personally as well that idea that you know when [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3398.06s)]
*  you get clear about your values it's easy to make a decision to say this is my value giving back this [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YN2-oEBCJw&t=3403.74s)]
