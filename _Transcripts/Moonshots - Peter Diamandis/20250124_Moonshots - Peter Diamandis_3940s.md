# How the New Administration Will Impact Crypto, AI & Tech Globally w/ Ben Horowitz & Salim Ismail
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg)
*  The Biden administration was by far the most anti-tech presidency in my lifetime. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=0.0s)]
*  Complete war with the industry. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=6.0s)]
*  Are we in for an extraordinary acceleration and reimagination of crypto and bitcoin and all? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=7.76s)]
*  One of the things that you only know if you're deep in the crypto industry is [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=16.56s)]
*  there was nobody developing software in the space. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=19.84s)]
*  It just really, really slowed down over the last four years and now it's back. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=22.16s)]
*  We are in a race with China on AI and we're trying to control it by chips. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=28.0s)]
*  I am curious your thoughts about all this. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=34.24s)]
*  I do think we're in a race. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=36.0s)]
*  The danger of course is... [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=37.68s)]
*  Hey everybody, Peter Diamandis here. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=42.0s)]
*  Welcome to Moonshots, another special episode of WTF Just Happened in Tech [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=43.44s)]
*  with my bestie, Saleem Ismail. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=48.16s)]
*  And on this episode, I'm joined with an incredible tech investor, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=50.64s)]
*  perhaps one of the most dominant in the world and that's Ben Horowitz of A16Z. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=54.24s)]
*  In 1999, Ben co-founded LoudCloud, which evolved and became an enterprise software [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=60.400000000000006s)]
*  company sold for 1.6 billion dollars to Hewlett Packard. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=66.88s)]
*  Then in 2009, Horowitz joined with Mark Andreessen to co-found Andreessen Horowitz, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  also known as A16Z, a venture capital fund with, get this, over 45 billion dollars assets under [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=75.84s)]
*  management. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=83.28s)]
*  He's the author of two bestselling books with incredible names, incredible content, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=84.24s)]
*  The Hard Things about hard things and What You Do is Who You Are. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=89.04s)]
*  All right, let's jump into this episode. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=95.36s)]
*  This is just after the inauguration, after some recent conversations about breakthroughs in AI, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=98.08s)]
*  in robotics, in crypto. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=104.56s)]
*  It really feels like we're in the future and it's the year 2025. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=106.56s)]
*  All right, what just happened in tech this week? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=109.92s)]
*  We're going to find out. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=112.32s)]
*  Let's jump in. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=113.27999999999999s)]
*  Ben, good to see you this morning. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  Where are you today? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I'm in Las Vegas. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=117.11999999999999s)]
*  Great to see you, Peter. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  Great to see you, Salim. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=119.52s)]
*  Likewise. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=120.72s)]
*  Salim, as always. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=121.19999999999999s)]
*  And, you know, a lot happening in tech this week. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=122.32s)]
*  Super pumped to have Ben join us in this conversation because I think you've got a front row seat to some [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=124.72s)]
*  most extraordinary things happening. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=130.48s)]
*  And, you know, I think one of the things happened this week is we've got a new president. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=133.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=138.95999999999998s)]
*  I have to imagine this is probably do you think this is the most tech forward administration [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=140.16s)]
*  we have ever had? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=145.6s)]
*  Well, it's certainly the most dramatic change in tech policy that we've ever seen, just because [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=148.32s)]
*  the Biden administration was by far the most anti-tech presidency in my lifetime. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=156.72s)]
*  And then, you know, Trump, at least in his first four days, has been full out, like, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=163.2s)]
*  aggressive pro tech. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=171.84s)]
*  So it's just it's so night and day. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=174.08s)]
*  The contrast is absolutely shocking. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=177.52s)]
*  It's like a whipsaw. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=182.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=182.96s)]
*  Like it's almost unbelievable. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=183.28s)]
*  It's through the licking glass kind of thing. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=185.52s)]
*  Well, if there's ever a time that we're going to accelerate humanity to Mars, get digital [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=188.72s)]
*  super intelligence up and running, extend the healthy human lifespan, I think this... [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=195.12s)]
*  Yeah, like when Trump said we're going to Mars, I was like, OK, let's go. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=202.0s)]
*  As always, we'll talk about AI, robotics, crypto. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=209.6s)]
*  But I think this was interesting. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=212.72s)]
*  Looking at the front row seat of what was going on at the administration inauguration here, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=214.56s)]
*  I think was pretty extraordinary. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=220.16s)]
*  Did you or Mark get an invite to go or did you decide to sort of stay home? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=222.8s)]
*  Yeah, well, you know, we have been spending a lot of time with the administration and [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=226.64s)]
*  at Mar-a-Lago, but, you know, inauguration isn't... [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=230.32s)]
*  We're not really party people, so we didn't go. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=234.64s)]
*  We had many people from the firm went to the inauguration and they said that it was [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=237.84s)]
*  great fun. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=242.32s)]
*  So, you know, what I thought was fascinating was Davos was going on at the same time. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=243.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, quite the contrast. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=248.23999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=250.95999999999998s)]
*  Well, these guys would normally be at Davos. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=251.44s)]
*  Yeah, I think they aligned, aligned properly. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=253.6s)]
*  Celine, what do you think about... [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=258.32s)]
*  And by the way, most of them were very anti-Trump in 2016, 2020, so it's quite the change. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=259.28s)]
*  It is. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=267.44s)]
*  It is. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=269.44s)]
*  I mean, when you're about to jump on a fast moving elevator or rocket ship, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=270.32s)]
*  you got to make a choice. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=277.36s)]
*  Celine, what are your thoughts about this lineup here? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=278.48s)]
*  I feel like this is like a Game of Thrones episode where the Lord of High Tower is told, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=280.64000000000004s)]
*  you better bend the knee or the sword is coming for you. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=284.88s)]
*  And so I think it's 50-50 excitement and defensiveness because you've got to play [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=290.08000000000004s)]
*  ball, but look at the game that we're now playing is amazing. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=295.44s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with that. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=298.64000000000004s)]
*  I think the excitement is like super real in that, look, everybody in tech has been [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=300.32s)]
*  oppressed, like literally. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=307.68s)]
*  I mean, I know that sounds ridiculous because, you know, they're like, oh, how can billionaires [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=309.36s)]
*  be oppressed and all that kind of thing? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=314.32s)]
*  But they really, the Biden administration was at complete war with the industry. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=316.08000000000004s)]
*  Like every single thing you tried to do in technology, I mean, they tried to completely [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=321.92s)]
*  outlaw FinTech or not even outlaw, destroy the FinTech and crypto industries. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=327.2s)]
*  That plus the incredible blankets, the incredible blanket on M&A, which is like ridiculous. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=334.71999999999997s)]
*  No major M&A can happen in that kind of environment. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=340.96s)]
*  And that just solves such a huge backlog of tech companies wanting to get an exit. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=343.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that was, we had a company within, it was called Within, which was a [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=350.32s)]
*  content company for VR that made an exercise game called Supernatural. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=356.96000000000004s)]
*  And the FTC blocked the acquisition by Meta on antitrust grounds. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=362.32000000000005s)]
*  And like, eventually it got through. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=368.72s)]
*  They lost the case because it was an absurd case. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=370.88000000000005s)]
*  But, you know, it's just harassment. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=373.28000000000003s)]
*  Like there was no, there's no antitrust. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=376.96000000000004s)]
*  Meta doesn't have a monopoly on VR. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=380.08000000000004s)]
*  VR is not like even like a market yet. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  Like, what are you talking about? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=384.32000000000005s)]
*  We also saw the meltdown of the entire biotech industry over the last four years. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=386.8s)]
*  Everybody, Peter here. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=390.88000000000005s)]
*  If you're enjoying this episode, please help me get the message of abundance out to the world. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=392.08000000000004s)]
*  We're truly living during the most extraordinary time ever in human history. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=397.52000000000004s)]
*  And I want to get this mindset out to everyone. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=401.36s)]
*  Please subscribe and follow wherever you get your podcasts and turn on notifications so we can let [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=404.48s)]
*  you know when the next episode is being dropped. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=410.24s)]
*  All right, back to our episode. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=412.88s)]
*  I think we're going to see a resurgence in all of these companies. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=414.8s)]
*  I mean, I'm in, I was in two, on the board of two public biotech companies. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=418.24s)]
*  I just saw this massive, you know, demonetization going on as the FDA and regulatory restrictions [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=422.88s)]
*  were like, no, you can't do that. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=431.68s)]
*  No, you can't merge there. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=433.84000000000003s)]
*  It just, it took the wind out of all the sales that, and people ended up leaving the United [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=435.84000000000003s)]
*  States to go overseas to get treatments because they can't do it in the United States. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=441.12s)]
*  So, you know, super excited about Bobby Kennedy and seeing what he's going to do. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=445.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=452.48s)]
*  Well, I mean, the other, and the other side of that is we actually needed a regulatory [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=452.72s)]
*  upgrade, right? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=457.68s)]
*  Because HIPAA was designed long before, you know, we could use data to cure disease and [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=458.4s)]
*  create amazing diagnostics and all these things. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=465.44s)]
*  And there was just no chance of getting to that. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=468.4s)]
*  You know, I had a great conversation with Dave Ricks from Eli Lilly, who's by the way, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=470.96s)]
*  like a fantastic CEO. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=476.08s)]
*  He's like one of us. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=478.88s)]
*  I mean, he's a real like product guy, talented guy. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=479.91999999999996s)]
*  And, you know, one of the reasons why drugs are so expensive to develop is they can't [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=483.67999999999995s)]
*  match the cure for the disease with the people who have the disease for the clinical trial. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=489.44s)]
*  Like, there's no way to do that. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=495.35999999999996s)]
*  It's like hunting for a needle in a haystack to find these patients, you know, whose lives [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=497.68s)]
*  could be saved because, you know, the current regulatory regime has kind of prevented that [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=504.24s)]
*  kind of thing. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=511.28000000000003s)]
*  So we're really hopeful that we can make great progress with RFK Jr. and the new team. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=511.84000000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=519.04s)]
*  Absolutely sure we can. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=519.76s)]
*  You know, on this image of the tech CEO's inauguration, I think I left Sam Altman [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=521.12s)]
*  off there so he wouldn't fight with the image on this. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=526.48s)]
*  That's a good fight, isn't it? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=530.5600000000001s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=532.08s)]
*  It's great, you know, nighttime TV to see what's going on here. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=535.36s)]
*  But it was, you know, listen, having all of these individuals in the front row, you know, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=539.6s)]
*  Bezos and Musk had just launched their rockets the week or days before. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=545.9200000000001s)]
*  You know, it's nice to have like two of the wealthiest people on the planet battling it [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=550.96s)]
*  out to get us get humane to space. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=554.16s)]
*  Then the rest of them here. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=557.36s)]
*  I mean, this, you know, the question is, is this the tech, the tech giant takeover of [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=559.36s)]
*  America? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=566.0799999999999s)]
*  And ultimately, I don't know about you, but I sort of think this is the way America thrives. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=567.28s)]
*  It has to be. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=574.24s)]
*  It's the best of America. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=575.4399999999999s)]
*  I mean, you know, this is the thing that's so frustrating if you're in tech, right? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=576.56s)]
*  We have this incredible industry where we've attracted literally the greatest people in [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=580.88s)]
*  the world. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=588.4s)]
*  I mean, like, look at that set. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=588.8s)]
*  You know, the only one who's kind of, I mean, Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg are kind of [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=591.12s)]
*  natively American. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=596.64s)]
*  Jeff, you know, his dad was a Cuban immigrant. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=597.84s)]
*  You know, everybody else is like an immigrant. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=601.6s)]
*  And they're all here and they're all building this country and our economy. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=605.36s)]
*  And our future. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=610.4000000000001s)]
*  And they've just been absolutely vilified for not anything they did, but like literally [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=612.4000000000001s)]
*  for being successful. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=619.2s)]
*  There's not anything people are pointing to and saying, oh, you know, Mark Zuckerberg's [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=620.1600000000001s)]
*  a bad guy because of this and that and the third. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=625.44s)]
*  It's like he's a bad guy because he's rich and he succeeded and he built something [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=628.72s)]
*  important. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=633.6800000000001s)]
*  And so that has just been so devastating culturally, I think. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=635.2s)]
*  And then you pile on that, you know, trying to outlaw all these efforts. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=640.08s)]
*  So I think and by the way, all these guys donated massive amounts of money to Biden, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=644.24s)]
*  Obama, like on the Democrat side, and nobody complained that they were controlling the [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=651.12s)]
*  government then. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=655.92s)]
*  And you have to wonder why. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=657.2s)]
*  And by the way, much more than Biden or Obama, Trump doesn't listen to anybody. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=658.5600000000001s)]
*  Like nobody's going to tell him what to do. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=664.4s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=665.76s)]
*  The one that really stuck in my craw was the Delaware court on Elon's 56 billion or [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=667.44s)]
*  whatever. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=672.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that was just unbelievable. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=673.36s)]
*  You look at somebody that's taken unbelievable risks, made the outcome, and then you want [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=674.96s)]
*  to harm that. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=679.36s)]
*  And the board approved it and then the shareholders approved it. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=682.96s)]
*  So like we own the company. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=687.44s)]
*  We all think it's a great idea. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=689.52s)]
*  He only gets paid if we get paid like a crazy amount of money. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=692.08s)]
*  And you're going to just after the fact say like, OK, corporate governance, like all the [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=696.16s)]
*  rules around that are fake. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=703.12s)]
*  And like we don't there's no rules. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=705.04s)]
*  Like I can just change the law whenever I want as an activist judge. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=707.36s)]
*  It's just unbelievable. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=710.88s)]
*  Insane. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=713.68s)]
*  And the fact of the matter is these guys employ in some total tens of millions, you [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=714.88s)]
*  know, bordering on 100 million Americans in some way, shape or form. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=720.72s)]
*  Let's talk about this. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=726.64s)]
*  This was an announcement this week that was interesting, interesting in a number of [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=727.36s)]
*  different ways. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=731.9200000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=732.48s)]
*  This is the announcement of Stargate, a quote, 500 billion dollar commitment on private [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=732.8000000000001s)]
*  infrastructure. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=740.24s)]
*  What are your thoughts about this, gentlemen? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=741.44s)]
*  OK, so there's, you know, it's a little unclear what it is. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=745.9200000000001s)]
*  So, you know, that aside, look, I think the idea that this administration wants to [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=750.88s)]
*  attract investment in America and is using kind of all of its mojo to do that is great. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=759.9200000000001s)]
*  And, you know, so that part is terrific. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=771.0400000000001s)]
*  You know, Massa is Massa. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=775.28s)]
*  We all know him. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=777.6s)]
*  And, you know, he's quite the character. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=778.56s)]
*  He's certainly brilliant and amazingly successful. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=782.24s)]
*  But, you know, he does things in a very specific way, which I don't want to overly [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=786.16s)]
*  comment on. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=790.72s)]
*  But, you know, look, building AI infrastructure, just watching in the bite with the Biden [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=792.64s)]
*  administration, there were so many kind of efforts to invest all around the world, not [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=797.6s)]
*  in America, in data centers and chips and whatnot. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=804.0s)]
*  And it's nice that, like, at least there is a kind of high profile effort to do that [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=808.16s)]
*  here. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=813.5999999999999s)]
*  I'd like to see the same effort in the energy sector of opening up more energy sources [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=813.8399999999999s)]
*  because we need energy and generation. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=820.0799999999999s)]
*  So I think that's 100% going to happen. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=821.68s)]
*  You know, we're very close with Doug Burgum, the new department, the head of the [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=824.24s)]
*  department of the Interior. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=828.8000000000001s)]
*  And he's really, really good on this topic. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=831.2s)]
*  And then Trump, of course, has said what he said and is extremely pro-energy. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=834.8000000000001s)]
*  So and they're going to definitely, I think, open up nuclear, which is the key for so [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=839.76s)]
*  many things. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=846.8000000000001s)]
*  And we're seeing great innovation in that area. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=847.6800000000001s)]
*  And when you see nuclear ban, you're talking about, like, generation four, small [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=850.64s)]
*  modular nuclear reactors and so forth. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=856.8000000000001s)]
*  Fish and like that you can put next to a data center, that kind of thing. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=859.04s)]
*  You're on your backyard. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=861.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=863.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=863.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=864.88s)]
*  They're getting safe enough that we, you know, they should be peppered throughout the [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=865.28s)]
*  United States. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=869.4399999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=870.72s)]
*  Well, and then there's another part of this where crypto really helps. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=871.28s)]
*  So we have this company, Daylight Energy. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=874.08s)]
*  And basically what they're doing is they're creating a marketplace. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=878.24s)]
*  So if you have solar panels and a Tesla Powerwall, right, you're going to have at [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=880.8s)]
*  many times more energy than you need. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=886.08s)]
*  So wouldn't it be great to have a marketplace where, like, anybody who needed energy could [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=888.4000000000001s)]
*  get, you know, ask your Powerwall for your energy. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=892.24s)]
*  But Powerwalls aren't people, so they don't have credit cards. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=896.48s)]
*  So how do they do that? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=899.84s)]
*  Well, you know, crypto is a perfect answer for machines paying machines. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=901.0400000000001s)]
*  And so, you know, that effort can now happen. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=905.36s)]
*  Like that was also illegal in the Biden world. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=908.48s)]
*  Or not. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=911.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I shouldn't say illegal because there was no law. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=912.4000000000001s)]
*  It was just like the government. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=914.64s)]
*  The government wasn't reading. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=918.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=919.84s)]
*  Basically using its power. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=920.4s)]
*  No, using its power to terrorize anybody in the field. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=922.8s)]
*  Well, there was the whole debanking thing, right, which was absolutely scandalous. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=926.96s)]
*  Absolutely scandalous what they did. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=930.88s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=932.3199999999999s)]
*  Kick them out of the banking system. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=932.96s)]
*  So we had more than two dozen companies kicked out of the banking systems. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=934.16s)]
*  Elizabeth Warren's been running around Washington telling people that's fake. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=938.0s)]
*  It was naked aggression against crypto. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=942.08s)]
*  And that's the naked aggression. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=944.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=945.8399999999999s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=946.9599999999999s)]
*  Looking at this photo here in the Stargate project, 500 billion dollars of capital deployment. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=947.92s)]
*  It's interesting, right? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=955.76s)]
*  So we see Elon tweeting, that's bullshit. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=956.48s)]
*  You know, Masa's only got, you know, at best 10 billion. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=959.6s)]
*  Which wouldn't be the first time, by the way. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=964.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=965.92s)]
*  There's definitely a discrepancy between claims and actualities. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=967.52s)]
*  But I have to wonder what the backroom conversation going on here, you know, with Elon and Trump [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=970.96s)]
*  on one side and Sam and then Larry Ellison's on Elon's board and involved in this. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=979.2800000000001s)]
*  So there's interesting bedfellows at work here. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=985.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think that, you know, this just feels like a Masa idea. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=987.76s)]
*  And, you know, this is Masa's genius, but also, I would say, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=993.44s)]
*  the things that people criticize him for, which is, you know, he is the moonshot financier of, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=998.64s)]
*  you know, our time. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1005.28s)]
*  And he is like great at raising a crazy amount of money. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1006.24s)]
*  And, you know, to do that sometimes, you know, you have to ladder up to it, I guess. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1010.24s)]
*  So, you know, it's a Masa thing. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1017.84s)]
*  The way I look at it, it's a Masa thing. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1020.8s)]
*  Like, will it work? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1022.48s)]
*  You know, maybe it'll work. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1023.28s)]
*  Will he get the money? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1024.32s)]
*  Maybe I'll get the money. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1025.12s)]
*  But like you can't say he won't get the money because it's Masa. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1026.08s)]
*  I think what's interesting here, the go-to once we've got this level of AI capability, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1030.48s)]
*  you know, what Larry Ellison was saying and Sam Alton was saying on top of this is we're going [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1037.84s)]
*  to use this large level of AI capability to cure disease, cure cancer. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1041.84s)]
*  You know, I'd love to add, extend the healthy human lifespan by decades on this. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1049.52s)]
*  But it is fascinating that people go to health as the first. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1054.16s)]
*  I mean, you must, I'm heavily invested in longevity and health across most investments. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1058.0800000000002s)]
*  I mean, it's the biggest disruptable marketplace. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1064.5600000000002s)]
*  How about yourself, Ben? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1067.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1069.28s)]
*  So we, you know, we have a big kind of effort there with our BioFund. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1069.52s)]
*  And we just did a really exciting partnership with Eli Lilly around that. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1073.68s)]
*  I think that so, so I really believe like technologically we're in a new place. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1078.96s)]
*  So the way we talk about it internally is, you know, physics we've been doing for, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1086.1599999999999s)]
*  you know, thousands of years, but it only got really interesting when we had a language that [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1092.32s)]
*  could model it, which was calculus. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1096.96s)]
*  And we now have a language that can model biology, which is AI. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1099.28s)]
*  And so it feels like we're really at the beginning of, of a kind of biological research. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1104.08s)]
*  And, and that's super exciting. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1110.8799999999999s)]
*  I would just caution it a little in terms of the rate, because people expect everything to work [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1114.6399999999999s)]
*  like it does in computers, because you do have to do, you know, in vivo tests, you know, you've got [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1121.04s)]
*  tests in animals and humans and, and that, that AI doesn't quite get rid of that. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1126.4s)]
*  Like, you know, we can have certainly much more targeted, much better engineered solutions. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1131.84s)]
*  We're not just, you know, see if this molecule works, you know, drug discovery and all that [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1137.28s)]
*  kind of thing. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1141.4399999999998s)]
*  But, you know, it'll still be slower than, than I think the progress that we are used to. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1142.08s)]
*  Agree. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1150.3999999999999s)]
*  Although we're able to model biological processes so much more thoroughly with digital twins and [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1150.72s)]
*  so on. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1156.3999999999999s)]
*  I think we'll be able to, the time period needed for in-vitro testing will be much more limited [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1157.12s)]
*  than before. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1162.32s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1163.76s)]
*  But, you know, and it would really help to have access to the data, right? [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1166.8s)]
*  Like particularly in the U.S. and some countries there. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1170.8799999999999s)]
*  As you know, Norway's got like amazing access to cancer data and so forth. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1173.04s)]
*  And there are places that have it. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1178.3999999999999s)]
*  But, but we do need more of that to get all the way home, I think. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1180.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1186.24s)]
*  And we'll talk about that with the recent announcement from Demis at DeepMind. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1186.6399999999999s)]
*  But I found this fascinating. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1191.76s)]
*  So at the beginning of the administration, Trump revoked Biden's 2023 AI executive order, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1193.52s)]
*  halting safety and transparency. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1199.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1202.8s)]
*  Good. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1203.92s)]
*  Interesting, right? [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1205.36s)]
*  This is taking the gloves off and accelerating the acceleration. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1206.08s)]
*  How do you think about this? [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1209.68s)]
*  You know, like I think, first of all, as you know, AI technology is very, very nascent. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1211.28s)]
*  I mean, like we're at, we're in the really early days. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1220.56s)]
*  So we don't know yet, you know, what it's going to be. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1223.44s)]
*  We are in, you know, like, by the way, a fairly important race with China from a military [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1228.6399999999999s)]
*  standpoint and so forth on AI. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1234.8799999999999s)]
*  Like it's be very bad for them or in a way for us to get too far ahead of the other one. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1236.56s)]
*  Like that becomes a very kind of unstable situation. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1242.72s)]
*  And so like the idea that the government's going to enter the field and basically what the [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1248.4s)]
*  Biden AI order did, you know, from our point of view was basically get all of startups [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1255.04s)]
*  and academia out of the field by imposing like big regulatory requirements. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1263.28s)]
*  And, you know, to do that at this stage is just, it's wild. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1270.56s)]
*  It's a wild idea. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1276.6399999999999s)]
*  I think, you know, we've tried this kind of heavy regulatory approach, which is why, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1277.6s)]
*  you know, we've got a climate change issue and no nuclear power and all that kind of thing. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1282.8799999999999s)]
*  And, you know, that was a kind of a much more dangerous technology, I think, at the time. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1288.08s)]
*  Obviously, like AI is powerful and it could do dangerous things. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1293.76s)]
*  But the whole idea that, you know, that the idea of like scaring people and then giving [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1299.2s)]
*  government control, you know, I think was just bad. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1307.6s)]
*  There's just I can't argue that the Biden executive order was good in any way. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1311.92s)]
*  So I think the executive order is bullshit and ridiculous and absurd because I have said this [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1316.8799999999999s)]
*  before many times. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1322.24s)]
*  I see no mechanism by which you can regulate AI even if you tried because the minute you [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1323.2s)]
*  try to set those goals, you'd have to regulate every line of code written. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1329.04s)]
*  It's completely ridiculous. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1332.8s)]
*  So undoing it undoes something that was so ridiculous it couldn't have happened anyway. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1334.96s)]
*  So for me, it's like the whole thing is a non-secret. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1340.16s)]
*  It does make it easier for people to do what they want to do with our freedom of stupid oversight. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1343.2s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1348.88s)]
*  The safety part couldn't have happened, but the interference was certainly happening. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1349.44s)]
*  And by the way, the other thing that's so crazy is, you know, you have people like my friend, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1354.4s)]
*  Vinod Khosla running around saying, oh, this is like the Manhattan Project. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1358.48s)]
*  We've got a lock. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1361.68s)]
*  Like you walk into OpenAI, you walk into Google, like it's so easy to steal their code. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1363.6000000000001s)]
*  Like what are you talking about? [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1369.2800000000002s)]
*  Like they've got like Chinese nationals running like all around the company. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1370.24s)]
*  Like you're not protecting the bits. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1374.4s)]
*  By the way, the Manhattan Project didn't even end up protecting like the nuclear secrets, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1377.2800000000002s)]
*  like Russia got them. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1381.68s)]
*  So it's just come on. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1384.16s)]
*  But I do think this is a, you know, firing over the bow of saying, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1386.96s)]
*  we're accelerating everything. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1393.8400000000001s)]
*  We're not slowing stuff down. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1395.3600000000001s)]
*  We're going to uplevel our energy, our investment commitments. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1397.0400000000002s)]
*  We're going all in, all out on AI because we need to. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1401.0400000000002s)]
*  It's the single most strategic. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1405.2800000000002s)]
*  Asset for our country. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1406.96s)]
*  And look, I think it's the way we solve a lot of the most dangerous problems that we have too. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1409.68s)]
*  So there's like, okay, we've got AI safety to stop AI from doing something bad, which won't work. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1417.5200000000002s)]
*  But what about like AI to stop all the other bad things from happening? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1424.5600000000002s)]
*  Sure. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1428.72s)]
*  Pandemic. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1428.96s)]
*  Pandemics, cancer, you know, et cetera. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1430.16s)]
*  It's a climate change, you name it. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1433.68s)]
*  You know, here's one of the articles I wanted to bring to the table here is [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1436.1599999999999s)]
*  Hasabas sees AI design drug trials this year. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1441.6799999999998s)]
*  I think this is one of the fascinating things. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1445.4399999999998s)]
*  I just remind people the way we discover drugs for all of human history [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1447.52s)]
*  is when we like march through the Amazon in galoshes and we like cut plants or grab dirt [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1451.1999999999998s)]
*  off Easter Island and we mix it up and we see if there's any biological activity. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1457.76s)]
*  And, you know, average drug costs 10 plus billion dollars and work 10% of the time. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1462.4s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1469.6000000000001s)]
*  And so this is precision drug development. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1471.6000000000001s)]
*  And in the future, you started to say this, Ben, it's precision drug development for you. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1475.44s)]
*  It's like for your genome. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1480.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1482.48s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1483.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1483.8400000000001s)]
*  You know, it's such a remarkable change in lifespan, health care and all these things [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1484.3200000000002s)]
*  and health span that like it's hard to even get your head around like how stone age we've been [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1496.0800000000002s)]
*  and how advanced this is going to be where we can say, oh, we need a protein that does this. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1502.0s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1509.52s)]
*  Like, let's have the AI make it for us. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1510.0800000000002s)]
*  It's just such a different world. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1512.48s)]
*  I mean, one of the things we have to say like drug discovery, like why do we call it drug discovery? [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1514.8s)]
*  Oh, it's because like if we were making bridges that way, we'd build a thousand bridges, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1519.68s)]
*  which everyone didn't fall down. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1523.68s)]
*  We just drive over that one. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1525.2s)]
*  This last year with toothpicks and glue to figure out which one was strongest. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1527.84s)]
*  This is drug design versus drug discovery. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1532.72s)]
*  For me, this is reminiscent of, you know, we used to frame this at Singularity was you say, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1535.68s)]
*  okay, we have a really well-understood stack for computation with chips and logic gates and [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1540.4s)]
*  operating systems, software and applications. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1545.2s)]
*  And we have turned out the same stack in biology with proteins and genes forming metabolic pathways [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1547.76s)]
*  leading to cells and organelles. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1552.88s)]
*  And essentially with modeling biology now, we've essentially turned the human being into a software [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1555.3600000000001s)]
*  engineering problem. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1560.64s)]
*  And we can take all the skills and understanding, you know, software design and apply it now. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1561.8400000000001s)]
*  And that is really, really interesting. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1565.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1567.8400000000001s)]
*  One of my investments, Ben, is Alex Zveronkov's company in Silico. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1568.4s)]
*  And they were early on with generative AI for creating this and they've gone into drug trials. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1575.0400000000002s)]
*  And I think this is the future of all drug discovery. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1579.92s)]
*  And it will be in Silico and you'll model. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1584.48s)]
*  It's like when the first example I use when Dragon first flew on a Falcon 9 to the space [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1587.6000000000001s)]
*  station, it worked perfectly. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1594.0s)]
*  And it wasn't like random luck. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1595.52s)]
*  I mean, they had modeled everything. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1597.28s)]
*  You know, they knew exactly every mode. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1599.76s)]
*  They knew exactly what was going to happen. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1601.6s)]
*  And when it worked because the model worked. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1602.8s)]
*  And so as Alpha Fold, Alpha Proteo, Alpha Fold 3, all these come online. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1605.2s)]
*  I think DEMIS wants to create a full AI model of the human cell so you can actually model [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1610.48s)]
*  this drug in that. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1619.84s)]
*  Because we have 40 trillion cells in our body, a billion chemical reactions per second per [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1621.52s)]
*  cell. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1626.64s)]
*  There's a lot going on. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1627.2800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, no, the cells are so that's such a great point that we've just not been able to model [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1628.88s)]
*  it at all. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1634.5600000000002s)]
*  Well, you know, and that's right now we're in engineering world. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1635.68s)]
*  If we can model things and then we can build things. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1642.0s)]
*  I love your analogy of a thousand bridges whichever one you could drive. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1645.2s)]
*  That's a great. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1648.0s)]
*  I don't remember that one. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1649.3600000000001s)]
*  That's great. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1650.3200000000002s)]
*  It's about 13 years ago. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1651.6s)]
*  I had my two kids, my two boys. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1654.56s)]
*  And I remember at that moment in time, I made a decision to double down on my health. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1657.04s)]
*  Without question, I wanted to see their kids, their grandkids. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1662.56s)]
*  And really, you know, during this extraordinary time where the space frontier and AI and crypto [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1667.12s)]
*  is all exploding, it was like the most exciting time ever to be alive. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1672.72s)]
*  And I made a decision to double down on my health. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1676.8s)]
*  And I've done that in three key areas. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1680.16s)]
*  The first is going every year for a fountain upload. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1682.96s)]
*  You know, fountain is one of the most advanced diagnostics and therapeutics companies. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1687.44s)]
*  I go there, upload myself, digitize myself about 200 gigabytes of data that the AI system [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1691.28s)]
*  is able to look at to catch disease at inception. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1698.0800000000002s)]
*  You know, look for any cardiovascular, any cancer, neurodegenerative disease, any metabolic [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1701.76s)]
*  disease. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1706.72s)]
*  These things are all going on all the time and you can prevent them if you can find them [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1708.0s)]
*  at inception. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1713.04s)]
*  So super important. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1714.0s)]
*  So fountain is one of my keys. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1715.2s)]
*  I make it available to the CEOs of all my companies, my family members, because, you [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1716.48s)]
*  know, health is in you wealth. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1721.68s)]
*  But beyond that, we are a collection of 40 trillion human cells and about another 100 [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1724.0800000000002s)]
*  trillion bacterial cells, fungi, viri. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1730.0s)]
*  And we, you know, don't understand how that impacts us. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1733.28s)]
*  And so I use a company and a product called Viome. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1737.2s)]
*  And Viome has a technology called Metatranscriptomics. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1741.2s)]
*  It was actually developed in New Mexico, the same place where the nuclear bomb was [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1745.68s)]
*  developed, as a bio defense weapon. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1751.6s)]
*  And their technology is able to help you understand what's going on in your body to [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1753.92s)]
*  understand which bacteria are producing which proteins. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1760.56s)]
*  And as a consequence of that, what foods are your superfoods that are best for you to [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1763.44s)]
*  eat? [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1768.6399999999999s)]
*  Or what food should you avoid? [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1769.36s)]
*  Right? [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1771.52s)]
*  What's going on in your oral microbiome? [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1771.84s)]
*  So I use their testing to understand my foods, understand my medicines, understand my [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1775.04s)]
*  supplements. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1780.8799999999999s)]
*  And Viome really helps me understand from a biological and data standpoint, what's [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1782.0s)]
*  best for me. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1787.44s)]
*  And then finally, you know, feeling good, being intelligent, moving well is critical, [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1789.1200000000001s)]
*  but looking good. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1793.6000000000001s)]
*  When you look yourself in the mirror, saying, you know, I feel great about life is so [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1794.3200000000002s)]
*  important. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1798.72s)]
*  Right? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1799.6000000000001s)]
*  And so a product I use every day, twice a day, is called OneSkin, developed by four [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1800.24s)]
*  incredible PhD women that found this 10 amino acid peptide that's able to zap senile [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1806.5600000000002s)]
*  cells in your skin and really help you stay youthful in your look and appearance. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1813.68s)]
*  So for me, these are three technologies I love and I use all the time. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1819.68s)]
*  I'll have my team linked to those in the show notes down below. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1824.96s)]
*  Please check them out. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1828.8s)]
*  Anyway, hope you enjoyed that. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1830.16s)]
*  Now back to the episode. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1831.8400000000001s)]
*  You know, so this brings me to one of the questions that was the most asked question [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1833.2s)]
*  on X. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1838.16s)]
*  And so let's talk about this because, you know, the majority of entrepreneurs out there [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1840.0s)]
*  who see this incredible moonshot success story, this person or gal does this incredible [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1847.2s)]
*  thing and they don't realize the hundreds of failures on the way. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1851.92s)]
*  I call them an overnight success after 11 years of hard work. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1856.96s)]
*  I mean, you've built some amazing companies and you've invested in extraordinary companies. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1862.24s)]
*  How do you think about this? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1868.0s)]
*  Yeah, so it's a very, you know, particularly when like the real, the very large ideas. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1870.0s)]
*  So first of all, like it's really important that the person building it [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1878.16s)]
*  really have difference to how hard it is to make the product work. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1888.48s)]
*  And so like we have people come in and there's, you know, it's a 20 person company and eight of [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1892.56s)]
*  them are vice presidents, you know, because they're going to manage this big thing that [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1900.8s)]
*  they don't have. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1904.8s)]
*  And that never worked. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1906.08s)]
*  By the way, that never works. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1907.04s)]
*  It never works. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1908.0s)]
*  It's funny. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1908.4s)]
*  Yeah, you need engineers. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1909.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1911.44s)]
*  So you need to have engineers and also be just committed to keeping the company the [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1911.68s)]
*  right size until you actually kind of can see daylight and see the thing work. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1920.24s)]
*  And then, you know, the fundraising for moonshot ideas is like an order of magnitude [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1928.16s)]
*  more difficult than normal fundraising because one way more things go wrong. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1936.24s)]
*  So there's going to be a round that you have to do when everything is a wreck. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1942.0s)]
*  And so if you look at the guys who have built the really, really, really, really big ones, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1947.2s)]
*  Elon Musk and Sam Waltman, Palmer Leckie, these guys are unbelievable. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1952.72s)]
*  They can raise money when there's no reason to give them money. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1959.2s)]
*  And that's that just ends up being, I think, very, very important to be able to do because [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1963.28s)]
*  you're going to hit that point. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1970.32s)]
*  Is that correct, Ben? [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1971.44s)]
*  What is that? [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1973.68s)]
*  I think it's a combination of who they are, like the depth and the color of their vision, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1976.72s)]
*  their ability to tell a narrative, the kind of depth of that narrative so that when you [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1984.0s)]
*  go into the company, you really see it all there. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1991.92s)]
*  I mean, this is the thing that Elon had. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1994.4s)]
*  The depth of their conviction, right? [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1996.88s)]
*  Nothing will stop them for this. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=1999.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2002.0s)]
*  Nobody, right? [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2003.28s)]
*  Elon, who's the greatest moonshot entrepreneur of our era, nobody would question whether [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2003.84s)]
*  you could stop him from reaching his goal. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2011.44s)]
*  I mean, like he, you know, unbelievable amazing. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2013.6799999999998s)]
*  Never bet against Elon. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2017.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2018.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2019.2s)]
*  Well, that was, by the way, that was when I speak to my friends who are very sad about [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2019.44s)]
*  the election, I just say, like, why did you guys pick on him? [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2025.36s)]
*  Like of all the people to harass for no reason. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2028.96s)]
*  Makes no sense. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2032.96s)]
*  One of the most competent person in the world, you're going to pick on him. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2034.24s)]
*  Like that's not going to end well for you. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2038.72s)]
*  Don't do that. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2040.4s)]
*  That's just crazy. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2041.04s)]
*  Everybody in Silicon Valley knows don't do that. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2042.08s)]
*  But if I drill into this a bit, Ben, somebody comes in with a vision, right? [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2044.72s)]
*  They have to be half crazy to even have the vision. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2050.72s)]
*  So now you're dealing with a 50% rational. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2054.08s)]
*  Right, it sounds crazy. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2055.68s)]
*  Right? [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2056.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2057.12s)]
*  And so now you have to, you have limited data on which to gauge whether this person has [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2057.52s)]
*  the aura, the charisma, the chemistry, the diligence, the fortitude to get it through. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2061.6s)]
*  So it's the amount of kind of viable candidates is shrinking quickly. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2068.7200000000003s)]
*  How do you make that judgment call? [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2073.44s)]
*  That's the hard part, I think. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2075.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2077.12s)]
*  Because you guys have done it repeatedly successfully, which is amazing. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2079.68s)]
*  Yeah, they really have to be. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2084.16s)]
*  And look, we get it wrong a lot, too. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2085.84s)]
*  Kanye's that kind of prototype. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2087.84s)]
*  He's a super fucking genius. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2089.84s)]
*  But there is times where he won't do what's logical for the business just because he's [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2091.36s)]
*  overly creative. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2098.08s)]
*  So those people show up in tech, too. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2099.36s)]
*  And that's hard to make work because at some point they just drive everybody in the company [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2102.88s)]
*  insane. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2109.2000000000003s)]
*  The other one is they're so charismatic. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2111.1200000000003s)]
*  They end up being sloppy. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2113.6s)]
*  And you guys have probably seen this where it's kind of like the kid who's so charming [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2115.6s)]
*  that he doesn't have to study, just gives the teacher an apple and smiles at her and [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2120.64s)]
*  like, bang, he's got an A. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2124.4s)]
*  Like, there are entrepreneurs like that that are so good at storytelling and so charismatic. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2126.4s)]
*  And they can get the whole thing going. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2132.88s)]
*  But the detailed work that they don't want to do, they don't want to do, they don't want [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2135.84s)]
*  to do, like every CEO has that something that you really don't want to deal with, but you [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2142.72s)]
*  have to. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2146.7999999999997s)]
*  They don't end up dealing with and then it falls apart because these ideas are really [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2148.16s)]
*  complex and require like a great amount of precision at some point. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2152.3199999999997s)]
*  Let me hit you on something. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2157.6s)]
*  So my fund, Bold Capital, recently made an investment in Figure AI. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2159.92s)]
*  You know Brett Eichhoff in Figure, yes? [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2165.6s)]
*  One of the real ones. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2167.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I know. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2168.3199999999997s)]
*  Big. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2169.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2169.52s)]
*  And so the reason we made the investment, so here's Brett, no background in the robotics [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2170.88s)]
*  field, but he had built Archer Aviation, right, the EVTOL. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2176.96s)]
*  And so there's one question about the entrepreneur coming in. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2183.04s)]
*  Do they have a track record of actually having done hard things? [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2187.6000000000004s)]
*  So that's one bucket to evaluate. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2191.2000000000003s)]
*  The second bucket, which was really the most interesting evaluation criteria for me, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2194.6400000000003s)]
*  making the go to invest was the people he had pulled in over the first six months, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2200.08s)]
*  the people who had voted with their feet. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2207.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, that's definitely a real sign. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2210.08s)]
*  Like can they put together a team, that kind of team, and which is right, the people [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2214.3199999999997s)]
*  working for them. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2220.4s)]
*  This is a question I ask myself, by the way, on these kinds of ones, like would I work [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2223.44s)]
*  for this company? [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2227.2s)]
*  Like would I be excited about going to work for this company? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2228.24s)]
*  Or would I go, wow, I could help that entrepreneur build it. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2231.2s)]
*  Like if it's the latter, then I'm like, okay, we should not put money in, because they [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2235.7599999999998s)]
*  have to kind of be able to attract the highest level of talent to build something that hard. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2241.12s)]
*  So that's a really, really good measure. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2248.08s)]
*  And then I would say there's another thing about the team that's important, which is [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2253.12s)]
*  also true about how the entrepreneur picks their investor, which is because it's a moon [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2257.44s)]
*  shot, there's going to be really bad times, or they're very likely to be very bad times. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2263.04s)]
*  And so you want to have a team that, you know, isn't already like a lot of times it's a [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2270.4s)]
*  great team by resume, but they're already rich and successful. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2277.6s)]
*  And when things go wrong, they literally call in rich, they're like, oh, this is too [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2282.56s)]
*  hard. I'm not going to help you get out of this hole. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2287.12s)]
*  Call in rich, that's hilarious. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2289.04s)]
*  Yeah. And so like, I do think it's important that the team be kind of the right kind of [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2291.12s)]
*  mission super hungry. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2297.04s)]
*  And often like this has got like they need this to work. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2299.68s)]
*  You know, they're not wanted to work, but needed to work. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2303.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Well, this is this is Elon circa 2008 when the third Falcon one had blown up and [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2306.7999999999997s)]
*  borrowing money and everything's on the line. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2315.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2317.76s)]
*  And you need you need your best people to be like, I, you know, I will go through the [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2318.96s)]
*  trauma of, you know, maybe I don't even have a job. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2325.92s)]
*  And like, this is everybody thinks we're idiots and all that kind of thing. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2329.6000000000004s)]
*  Like, that's a tough. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2332.96s)]
*  It's a very tough point to be in a company because like when you're at a company like [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2334.6400000000003s)]
*  SpaceX, or you have one of these things that's very visible, you know, when it gets into [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2338.0s)]
*  trouble, the press just goes crazy on you. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2342.8s)]
*  Everybody's, you know, your friends, your family are like, should you really be working [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2345.04s)]
*  there? I mean, like you absolutely get those questions. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2349.2000000000003s)]
*  And, you know, if you're not totally committed, you're going to go and then then then the [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2352.7200000000003s)]
*  whole thing is a train wreck. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2360.4s)]
*  This is why we we have this massive transformative purpose idea that if you're not all [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2362.0s)]
*  bought into the overall vision, then you will call in rich or call in sick or devote [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2367.6s)]
*  to find another job. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2373.2s)]
*  But if you've got a big enough vision that everybody is aligned to, then that provides [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2375.36s)]
*  the cohesive sticking power. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2379.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's got to be cohesive even when it looks like the vision is wrong. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2381.2s)]
*  That's the key because when it looks like the vision is right, everybody, everybody's [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2387.04s)]
*  in. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2390.96s)]
*  You've been another criteria is if the founding team are best friends, because you're [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2391.12s)]
*  far unlikely to ditch the company when the tough, when it gets difficult, if your best [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2397.6s)]
*  buddies are there with you. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2402.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2404.88s)]
*  If they haven't just met. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2405.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2406.4s)]
*  A lot of times the founding team is or newly acquainted and you have to get into that. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2406.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2412.2400000000002s)]
*  Let me ask two questions on on this evaluation, because again, I want to this isn't important [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2412.64s)]
*  for the for everybody watching who's wanting to build a moonshot company. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2416.7200000000003s)]
*  How is important? [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2421.04s)]
*  How important is early revenue? [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2421.76s)]
*  And, you know, and the timeline and not having to insert miracle here when you're hearing [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2424.56s)]
*  this presentation? [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2434.08s)]
*  So I think early revenue is and ends up being really important as much as a discipline, [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2436.0s)]
*  you know, as an indicator of, you know, like invest. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2448.32s)]
*  So like not so much from a OK, we want to understand everything about the business [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2455.1200000000003s)]
*  model early, but more of that. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2461.6s)]
*  Oh, we hit a real milestone. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2464.2400000000002s)]
*  Like we've got all these smart people. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2466.4s)]
*  We're building this thing. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2468.48s)]
*  And, you know, it's not just a plan like there in Silicon Valley. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2470.48s)]
*  There have been a lot of platforms in the sky, so to speak. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2476.24s)]
*  There was a phenomenal company years ago. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2479.8399999999997s)]
*  You probably remember it. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2482.08s)]
*  Micro unity, which was, you know, had all the, you know, the greatest people in the [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2483.3599999999997s)]
*  field in it. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2489.4399999999996s)]
*  And it just never, you know, you got to get to a product. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2491.2799999999997s)]
*  You got to get to something that somebody wants. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2495.3599999999997s)]
*  Or like if you're in the wilderness too long, something happens to the culture of the [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2498.56s)]
*  company, something, you know, that's degenerative where you could be very much on the wrong track. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2505.12s)]
*  General Magic was another one. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2513.2s)]
*  Yeah, I remember General Magic for sure. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2514.72s)]
*  Yeah, phenomenal. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2516.0s)]
*  Like those two companies had talent levels that I would say rival SpaceX, Tesla, Open AI, [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2517.04s)]
*  any of them, right? [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2525.12s)]
*  And a big vision. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2525.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and an amazing vision. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2526.56s)]
*  But the revenue, your revenue point, I think, is that discipline that they didn't quite have. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2528.88s)]
*  So when you get like brilliant people together, they want to build a perfect product. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2537.12s)]
*  That can lead to a really over engineered system. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2543.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2546.56s)]
*  Moving us forward, I'm just going to point out, you know, when I look at the Twittersphere, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2549.6s)]
*  you don't tweet very much, but Mark tweets all the time. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2559.36s)]
*  Yeah, well, I spend all my time trying to control him. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2562.88s)]
*  You see only the things that don't get us into trouble. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2565.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2570.64s)]
*  You're in Las Vegas. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2570.96s)]
*  Do you know some friends of mine, Penn and Teller? [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2571.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I don't know them. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2574.96s)]
*  I, of course, know who they are. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2577.04s)]
*  Yeah, so Penn is the one who's talking all the time and Teller is the one who's silent. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2578.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I'm Teller, right? [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2581.6s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2584.64s)]
*  So I am curious, right? [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2586.0s)]
*  So just as we complete the conversations on AI, you know, you said this earlier, [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2588.2400000000002s)]
*  and I think, you know, Eric Schmidt's been saying this very loudly. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2596.8s)]
*  We are in a race with China on AI and we're trying to control it by chips. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2601.1200000000003s)]
*  You know, Mark, you're not speaking on behalf of Mark, but I am curious your thoughts about all this. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2608.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, so like I do think we're in a race in the sense that, well, we are and we aren't, [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2613.68s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2623.6s)]
*  So, you know, DeepSeq, which is the great Chinese model right now, is open source. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2624.48s)]
*  By the way, a lot of American companies that we're involved with are benefiting greatly [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2630.7999999999997s)]
*  from that, you know, in the paper they wrote. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2635.2s)]
*  And, you know, like it looks like they may have stolen some stuff from OpenAI as well, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2637.84s)]
*  you know, which is interesting, but just shows kind of how like hard it is to win this war by [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2645.44s)]
*  protection or this competition, I should say. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2652.56s)]
*  Look, the danger, of course, is, you know, China is a top-down economy. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2656.8s)]
*  They don't believe in things like freedom of speech and a lot of the kind of values [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2664.24s)]
*  of Western society, their surveillance state in many ways. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2671.7599999999998s)]
*  And so a lot of the things that we like, they don't have. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2675.2799999999997s)]
*  So if they get a much more powerful AI than us, then, you know, their way of life could [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2679.2s)]
*  trump our way of life, so to speak. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2684.7999999999997s)]
*  Now, if you look at, okay, then let's get into the details and how's that really playing out. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2688.72s)]
*  So first of all, what is China good at? [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2693.28s)]
*  The advantage they have, which is a very clear advantage, is their private sector and their [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2696.96s)]
*  public sector, you know, their government and the private companies, there's no line between them. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2702.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2707.1200000000003s)]
*  Like they're basically, in a lot of ways, the same thing. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2707.6000000000004s)]
*  And as a result, the AI technology in China is getting very quickly integrated into the [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2711.52s)]
*  government, which is, you know, quite amazing for them. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2716.6400000000003s)]
*  I want to inject one thought here. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2719.84s)]
*  Including the military, by the way. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2721.6000000000004s)]
*  The way I think about it is China is a single corporation. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2723.44s)]
*  And the companies inside China, within China, are apps sitting on top of that company. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2728.88s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's a good way of thinking about it. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2735.6000000000004s)]
*  And so you can think about, well, what's our advantage? [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2738.6400000000003s)]
*  Our advantage is we're great at startups, meaning every talented person in America [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2741.0400000000004s)]
*  can solve a really hard problem and bring us forward. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2748.5600000000004s)]
*  And that creativity, because it's not centrally planned, it's kind of distributed, bottoms up, [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2753.28s)]
*  has been historically our whole advantage, right? [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2761.0400000000004s)]
*  Like that's why we've, you know, been a world leader in technology. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2763.76s)]
*  And so the idea that we're going to just forfeit that advantage and have it be top-down [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2768.6400000000003s)]
*  control, like the Biden executive order imagined, is to me the most dangerous thing in the [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2774.2400000000002s)]
*  competition, is that, okay, if we try and control the way we work, all of our strengths, [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2780.88s)]
*  so we can be more China-like, China's going to destroy, they're going to be way better [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2787.36s)]
*  at being China than we are, because they have all the controls and all the mechanisms in place to do that. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2791.6800000000003s)]
*  They, listen, communism failed under previous systems, but if you've got a [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2796.48s)]
*  single controlling, optimizing AI, communism- [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2802.8s)]
*  That would help. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2807.28s)]
*  Yeah, it does. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2808.1600000000003s)]
*  Salim, what are your thoughts here? [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2810.56s)]
*  You know, I kind of don't see this tension as big as others. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2812.56s)]
*  The reason I don't is disruptive innovation means you have to break the rules. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2817.8399999999997s)]
*  And when you have a government that won't allow you to break any rules, [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2823.7599999999998s)]
*  you can't do disruptive innovation. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2826.48s)]
*  You basically have to copy it, absorb it. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2827.92s)]
*  So the sphere of what they can bring in is limited because of that. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2830.08s)]
*  And so I think there's a structural, there's still no Chinese student that will go, [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2834.7200000000003s)]
*  will dare to argue against their professors. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2841.76s)]
*  And I just find that a problem culturally for doing anything. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2844.7200000000003s)]
*  And whereas the US has built on that, it just keeps trolling along doing that. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2848.08s)]
*  It's messy and it's ugly, but it's very Darwinian. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2852.4s)]
*  But by far, it's the best way of doing it. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2855.36s)]
*  It's design versus evolution. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2857.36s)]
*  Yeah, and I 100% agree with that. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2858.88s)]
*  So I think, look, our opportunities will win. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2861.92s)]
*  We'll get to the breakthroughs first. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2864.2400000000002s)]
*  We probably won't stop them from stealing them, but at least we'll be even. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2866.1600000000003s)]
*  We'll be on par. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2869.92s)]
*  Whereas if we don't have the breakthroughs, we're in a lot of trouble. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2871.76s)]
*  If we somehow restrict it. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2876.0s)]
*  You know, I find this interesting. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2878.56s)]
*  We got China creating an $8 billion investment fund while we're talking about [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2880.08s)]
*  hundreds of billions of dollars. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2884.6400000000003s)]
*  It's a very different ecosystem of financial. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2886.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, we're investable, right? [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2892.64s)]
*  I mean, one of the great things that has happened in the change administration [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2894.32s)]
*  is from a technological standpoint, we're a very investable country. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2899.52s)]
*  Whereas China is going the other way on that. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2903.6s)]
*  They're making themselves uninvestable. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2906.08s)]
*  You know, I had Kai-Fu Lee on our Moonshots podcast. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2908.32s)]
*  Speaking of a guy who just moved his, re-domiciled his company. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2912.4s)]
*  Yeah, but Kai-Fu pointed out something fascinating, which is because they were [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2917.04s)]
*  so restricted on access to GPUs. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2921.8399999999997s)]
*  This is Darwinian force that got them to be much more efficient on their algorithms. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2926.64s)]
*  Yeah, well, we've seen that. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2932.7999999999997s)]
*  We've seen that with DeepSec. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2934.08s)]
*  It is very close to GPT-4 with way, way much smaller. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2935.7599999999998s)]
*  Their cost per token is so low for those. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2946.08s)]
*  Yeah, like 100x lower. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2949.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2951.2799999999997s)]
*  So is A16Z invested in humanoid robots? [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2951.7599999999998s)]
*  But before then, I have to ask you a question. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2956.72s)]
*  Do you remember the moment in time when you went from AndresNaharowitz.com to A16Z? [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2958.96s)]
*  I said you were out. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2965.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I remembered very clearly because it was my idea. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2966.56s)]
*  It was your idea. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2969.7599999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2970.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2971.4399999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2971.8399999999997s)]
*  So that was so... [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2972.16s)]
*  It's a funny story. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2975.2799999999997s)]
*  So when we went to Raise Fund One, and it was just Mark and myself in the fund, [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2976.64s)]
*  the biggest question we got is, well, you guys are very like, you know, [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2982.64s)]
*  kind of well-known entrepreneurs. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2987.2799999999997s)]
*  Why aren't you just going to walk away from this fund? [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2989.7599999999998s)]
*  And so we're like, well, we should just name it after ourselves. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2992.56s)]
*  So they know we'll be here. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2994.8s)]
*  And so we got, you know, that's all. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2996.4s)]
*  But then we're like, nobody in the world can spell AndresNaharowitz. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=2999.36s)]
*  Like, we're screwed. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3004.2400000000002s)]
*  And so then, I mean, you all remember in the old days when we used to program, [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3006.0800000000004s)]
*  there was this, you know, before programming languages evolved a lot, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3012.8s)]
*  you used to have to go through a lot of work to internationalize the code. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3016.48s)]
*  And we would abbreviate that work with calling it I18N, I18M. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3020.7999999999997s)]
*  And so I was like, oh, well, it'll be A16Z. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3026.24s)]
*  And all the kind of old school geeks will love us. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3031.2s)]
*  So that was funny. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3034.64s)]
*  And I did love it. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3035.68s)]
*  Are you investing in humanoid robots? [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3040.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3043.2799999999997s)]
*  So we haven't yet made an investment in a hardware company. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3043.44s)]
*  We're definitely been looking at the space very closely and seeing some of the work going on there. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3047.84s)]
*  It's tricky because the supply chain for robots is almost entirely out of China now. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3056.6400000000003s)]
*  Like, so there's nobody else doing it. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3063.52s)]
*  You know, there's a German company, but that is actually founded by Chinese nationals. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3065.6000000000004s)]
*  There's not a lot of, you know, so we're trying to understand that, you know, we, [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3070.8s)]
*  you know, have great relationships in Japan and are hoping, you know, we can kind of help them [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3077.36s)]
*  get some of that going as well. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3083.2799999999997s)]
*  But it's going to be massively important. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3084.88s)]
*  And Elon, of course, will do something, I think, with Tesla. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3088.32s)]
*  I mean, I believe Optimus and Figure in the US are two of the leading players. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3091.7599999999998s)]
*  There's Agility and Eptronic. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3098.48s)]
*  There's a good dozen solid US players. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3101.12s)]
*  But China, as this next article we're putting up, and if you're listening on your favorite [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3103.92s)]
*  download, let me just read this for people listening and watching. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3110.0s)]
*  It says humanoid robots will help build iPhones at Foxconn factories. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3114.4s)]
*  And the notion here is, I mean, China succeeded as a dominant tech player [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3121.04s)]
*  because of its low labor rate and its massive workforce population. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3125.76s)]
*  And one child policy and aging populations make it uncompetitive. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3130.96s)]
*  So it has to have robots to survive. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3135.92s)]
*  Same with Japan. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3140.0s)]
*  If they don't roboticize their economy, they won't survive. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3140.7200000000003s)]
*  GDP will collapse. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3144.88s)]
*  And Germany, by the way, and many countries. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3146.1600000000003s)]
*  It does, though, kind of take away the cheap labor advantage that they have in some ways, right? [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3151.6800000000003s)]
*  Because China grew in large part because labor arbitrage. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3159.52s)]
*  And so now they're saying, OK, we're going to replace the labor with robots. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3164.96s)]
*  There's not as much robot arbitrage. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3170.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3172.4s)]
*  I mean, I did the calculation. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3174.32s)]
*  So Optimus and Figure are supposed to sell at $30,000 per robot. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3175.7599999999998s)]
*  I'll take two. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3182.08s)]
*  If you lease it, that's $300 a month. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3183.92s)]
*  $10 a day, 40 cents an hour. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3187.12s)]
*  I mean, honestly, how many will you have in your backyard? [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3189.68s)]
*  That's a pretty good deal. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3194.4s)]
*  So and this is another one, interestingly, one. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3198.4s)]
*  Here, I'll read it for our listeners, for our viewers. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3201.68s)]
*  Shanghai rolls out China's first heterogeneous humanoid robot training ground. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3204.96s)]
*  And I think you were alluding to this, Ben, that China does one thing really well as a nation-state. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3210.24s)]
*  It creates sort of nests for companies. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3217.2s)]
*  You're a drone. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3223.7599999999998s)]
*  Shenzhen was the original one, right? [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3224.48s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3226.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3227.2799999999997s)]
*  Economic, what they call it, economic. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3228.08s)]
*  Opportunity zones. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3230.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3231.8399999999997s)]
*  Some kind of economic where there's no regulation and lots of government encouragement. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3232.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3238.08s)]
*  Celine, what are you thinking about this? [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3239.2799999999997s)]
*  I think it's great because you get what? [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3241.8399999999997s)]
*  But $1,000 by 2027 seems a little small. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3243.52s)]
*  This seems more like PR than anything else. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3247.52s)]
*  And I'd love to see the way in which they go about doing the testing and training. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3250.96s)]
*  And that you could learn a lot from. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3256.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3259.92s)]
*  The training of the robots is very, very interesting. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3260.8s)]
*  Also because the robot, the AI, I don't know what you all have seen, but what we've seen is [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3265.04s)]
*  the model architectures, a lot of them are like transformers and diffusion models [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3272.4s)]
*  with different kind of data and different training. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3279.84s)]
*  And so the training of robots has become like a very interesting field. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3284.48s)]
*  And they don't, they generalize, but from what I've seen, the training is pretty specific. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3290.24s)]
*  Specific so far. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3301.04s)]
*  Well, I mean, it has to be, you know, if you have an AI, it's software-based. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3302.5600000000004s)]
*  It doesn't matter if it goes off the rails a bit and starts hallucinating, whatever, whatever. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3306.1600000000003s)]
*  You don't want your robot going bananas on it, right? [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3310.1600000000003s)]
*  Like, that's just going to cause a lot of damage. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3312.88s)]
*  Yeah, I saw that movie. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3314.6400000000003s)]
*  Very entertaining. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3318.6400000000003s)]
*  Before we jump into crypto, which we'll close out, [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3320.1600000000003s)]
*  I have some questions from our audience on X. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3322.6400000000003s)]
*  I thought we're pretty good. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3324.96s)]
*  So Ben, to you and Celine, yourself. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3326.88s)]
*  When will AI agents replace whole employees, teams, and departments at companies? [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3330.32s)]
*  That's from Michael77717777. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3336.0800000000004s)]
*  And then when will we see our first AI CEO that A16Z is willing to invest in? [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3340.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so that's a great question. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3348.48s)]
*  I didn't know the first one is one that we talk about all the time and are trying to figure out. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3353.44s)]
*  I think the one conclusion that we have is it will happen in new companies way, way before, [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3358.6400000000003s)]
*  like an older company transforms. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3364.96s)]
*  I mean, like there are already, you do have bots doing customer support and lowering the number [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3366.96s)]
*  of support reps you need and that kind of thing. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3374.56s)]
*  Yeah, the whole jobs thing is interesting in that, like some of it is what do you need done? [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3376.8s)]
*  But like in a place like Google, a lot of it is like, okay, how much money are we bringing in? [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3382.96s)]
*  How many people do these managers want to manage and that kind of thing? [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3386.56s)]
*  I don't necessarily even think that's bad. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3395.44s)]
*  It's inefficient or whatever. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3397.68s)]
*  But all those processes, all those things that have to go like, no, we're doing it with AI now [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3399.2799999999997s)]
*  is I think it'd be a lot more gradual than it would need to be if you were just optimizing to it. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3410.48s)]
*  But for new companies, I think it'll happen. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3418.0s)]
*  I wonder if there's going to be the equivalency of a DEI type directive, [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3420.32s)]
*  which is a human first directive. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3424.48s)]
*  Oh, God help us. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3427.36s)]
*  I think that's my reaction to it as well. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3429.36s)]
*  The challenge is going to be companies that like, [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3432.72s)]
*  I employ humans because it's good for society. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3434.96s)]
*  Well, they'll be out of business in a year. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3437.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3439.2799999999997s)]
*  I'd like to build on what Ben said. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3440.56s)]
*  I think one of the things I remember being part of an AI automation task force with [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3442.16s)]
*  Eric Binyalsson and a few of those folks. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3447.9199999999996s)]
*  And they did a great job of saying that a typical job of today is not just a job that somebody does. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3450.16s)]
*  It's broken down to about 25 different tasks. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3454.9599999999996s)]
*  And you may automate like 10 of those, but you still have the other 15. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3459.04s)]
*  And therefore, you'll augment people with AI, but you won't replace them as such. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3462.48s)]
*  I think Ben's point is really dead on about new companies because then you can orient [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3466.88s)]
*  functions around what's automatable and have entire verticals. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3471.2000000000003s)]
*  And you completely create a new type of organization. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3475.6800000000003s)]
*  And that's, I think, will happen first. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3479.12s)]
*  We've talked about billion dollar, one employee startups, right? [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3481.44s)]
*  That's right. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3484.96s)]
*  That's right. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3486.1600000000003s)]
*  I think that'll be mostly boxes. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3486.56s)]
*  That's going to happen. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3488.0s)]
*  Yeah, that'll happen very quickly. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3488.7200000000003s)]
*  Have you seen anything yet? [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3490.0s)]
*  Have you seen anything, Ben? [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3491.12s)]
*  I mean, do you like, listen, I've got an army of agents. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3492.0s)]
*  I'm the CEO and we're printing money. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3494.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3499.76s)]
*  So the Klarna CEO is the most aggressive in talking about that. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3500.2400000000002s)]
*  We haven't seen a company that does that yet. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3505.1200000000003s)]
*  So we did have one instance of the AI CEO, so to speak. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3507.36s)]
*  So we fund these AI researchers who kind of do things, models without our LHF and kind of [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3514.72s)]
*  trained on different things and so forth. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3525.44s)]
*  And one of our researchers, Andy, built this bot truth terminal that was trained on [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3527.7599999999998s)]
*  memes and French philosophers and things like that. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3535.8399999999997s)]
*  And he gets on the internet, gets obsessed with this meme, the Goatse meme, [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3539.52s)]
*  and decides it needs, which is a token from 2004. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3543.68s)]
*  It needed money to promote the meme. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3548.48s)]
*  That was its first thing. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3551.12s)]
*  And my partner, Mark, gave him $50,000. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3552.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, and Bitcoin. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3556.7999999999997s)]
*  And then somebody else created a coin, the Goat coin, and the bot went crazy. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3558.24s)]
*  And the coin went to like a $500 million market cap at its peak and the bot made $10 million. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3563.44s)]
*  So that was our first instance of an AI making money like that in the funniest way possible. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3570.2400000000002s)]
*  One of the tokens I invested in is skating in your wake, AI 16Z. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3579.2000000000003s)]
*  And it's done well. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3589.6000000000004s)]
*  I know everybody in the firm is like, Ben, when are we going to launch a token if that [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3591.28s)]
*  one's worth a billion dollars? [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3595.2000000000003s)]
*  Our actual token would be worth... [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3597.28s)]
*  Let's go there as we close out on our final subject here, [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3603.2000000000003s)]
*  a subject that you are not that interested in, neither of you, but I'm interested. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3607.2000000000003s)]
*  So let's talk about this. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3612.5600000000004s)]
*  So, I mean, are we in for an extraordinary acceleration and reimagination of crypto [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3616.08s)]
*  and Bitcoin and all? [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3626.56s)]
*  Please. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3630.08s)]
*  Yeah, I would say definitely yes. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3631.6s)]
*  One of the things that you only know if you're deep in the crypto industry is [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3636.88s)]
*  the effect of the Biden administration was they just forced... [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3640.56s)]
*  Most of the American developers out of crypto. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3644.9599999999996s)]
*  So there was nobody developing software in the space. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3648.16s)]
*  And so it just really, really slowed down over the last four years, really three years. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3651.04s)]
*  And now it's back, but it's back and there are very urgent problems that are kind of [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3658.56s)]
*  best solved by crypto that have come into play because of AI. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3669.12s)]
*  So you have the first one being proof of human, right? [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3673.44s)]
*  How do you know you're not a bot? [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3678.96s)]
*  That's a crypto problem. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3680.6400000000003s)]
*  Second being deepfakes. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3682.08s)]
*  How do you know, like I put this out, that... [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3683.6800000000003s)]
*  Did you want the US government or Google or a company determining what's true and what's real? [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3688.08s)]
*  Or the game theoretic mathematical properties of the blockchain? [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3694.08s)]
*  So it's clearly the right thing for crypto to determine what's true. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3697.84s)]
*  Thirdly, machine to machine payments. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3703.52s)]
*  Now you have intelligent machines everywhere. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3705.52s)]
*  They have to be able to pay each other for things. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3708.4s)]
*  That's another crypto problem. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3711.36s)]
*  So with these really important problems out there, and we let the developers out of jail, [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3714.0s)]
*  literally let them out of jail. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3721.6800000000003s)]
*  Like I think this is going to be an incredible era for the field. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3724.8s)]
*  And it's so important. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3730.2400000000002s)]
*  By the way, the other thing, the other one that's really important that you all understand, [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3731.6800000000003s)]
*  because look, back in the days of the internet, I was in charge of, among other things at Netscape, [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3736.8s)]
*  like client side certificates, and we never got them deployed and we never got it to work. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3742.7200000000003s)]
*  But as a result, we have this horrible security architecture on the internet, [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3747.04s)]
*  which AI is exploiting like crazy. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3752.1600000000003s)]
*  They're breaking... [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3754.6400000000003s)]
*  These AI programs are breaking into everybody's stuff. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3755.76s)]
*  So the right answer is that I keep my stuff. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3759.28s)]
*  We have a PKI infrastructure. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3762.8s)]
*  I keep my stuff. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3765.04s)]
*  I have my keys. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3766.0s)]
*  If you want to know if I'm credit worthy, I give you a zero knowledge proof. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3767.2000000000003s)]
*  I don't give you my social security number or my bank account [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3770.32s)]
*  because I know it's going to get stolen. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3773.2000000000003s)]
*  And like we have the answer and we almost had it deployed with NFTs before the Biden administration [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3775.92s)]
*  hit a wrecking ball. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3783.2000000000003s)]
*  So we can get back to that and we can make the internet secure for consumers. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3785.28s)]
*  So I'm more fired up about this than... [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3790.48s)]
*  You're excited, right? [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3793.6800000000003s)]
*  This is incredible. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3794.6400000000003s)]
*  This is the roaring 20s. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3796.5600000000004s)]
*  How many crypto companies are you invested in these days at A16? [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3797.84s)]
*  There's hundreds. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3804.48s)]
*  We're the largest crypto investor in the world, I think, at this point. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3806.0800000000004s)]
*  And we also have a crypto startup school to kind of help people get into the field [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3808.96s)]
*  and get it going, which we had to start because all the... [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3814.0s)]
*  If you are a talented developer and you could go into AI [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3818.08s)]
*  or you could go get a Wells notice from the US government [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3822.08s)]
*  for your 10 person company, it was not a hard choice. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3826.48s)]
*  I think this is an absolute boom for crypto. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3830.56s)]
*  It solves problems, as you said, that we really, really need solving for. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3833.76s)]
*  Identity amongst others. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3838.64s)]
*  And I can't wait for some of this infrastructure to now get rolled out. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3840.4s)]
*  And the news item here for those who are listening is US SEC unveils task force [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3844.0s)]
*  to start work on crypto regulations. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3848.32s)]
*  The move is welcomed by the industry as Bitcoin hits all-time highs. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3851.36s)]
*  Salim, you still sticking with your... [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3856.16s)]
*  What was it? [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3858.24s)]
*  250K in 2025 prediction? [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3858.64s)]
*  I'll stick with 250 to 300 for this year. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3862.64s)]
*  That's my prediction for Bitcoin. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3865.44s)]
*  And Ben, not for attribution of investment. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3866.8s)]
*  No, I cannot. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3869.44s)]
*  I am not allowed. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3871.52s)]
*  We're an RIA, registered investment authority. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3872.72s)]
*  So I cannot make price predictions. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3875.4399999999996s)]
*  Listen, buddy, this has been so much fun. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3880.0s)]
*  I want to just go quick commendation here. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3882.72s)]
*  Ben, what you guys did with A16Z both in crypto and then moving towards being more of an [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3885.6s)]
*  investment bank, I thought was just brilliant. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3890.3999999999996s)]
*  So kudos on that. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3892.48s)]
*  It's just awesome to watch you guys. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3894.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3896.48s)]
*  Appreciate that. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3896.7999999999997s)]
*  This was fun. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3897.7599999999998s)]
*  I hope you'll come back and join us for another conversation like this in a quarter or so. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3898.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, no, I'd love to. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3903.04s)]
*  That would be great fun. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3903.9199999999996s)]
*  All right, buddy. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3905.12s)]
*  Well, listen, thank you. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3906.0s)]
*  All I can say is we're on a rocket ship ride between what's going on in the crypto world, [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3907.8399999999997s)]
*  AI world, robotics world, space world. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZx9LGNeexg&t=3913.2s)]
