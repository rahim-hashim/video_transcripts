# AI Hype Vs. Reality 2024 - The State of Emerging Technologies w/ Salim Ismail | EP #115
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [August 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o)
*  If you've got open AI versus Google versus China versus Anthro-optic, if there's a step function interpreted or [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=0.0s)]
*  Intercepted by one of them it's game over then. Again disagree for my former reasons [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  If I could know anything or if I could predict anything how would it impact my business? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=12.32s)]
*  AI's in the super intelligence feels really powerful on the doing stuff [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  But the being is where all the future emanates from and where power comes from [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=21.64s)]
*  People don't realize the fact that we're living in a time where the things we take for normal and for granted are [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  Truly godlike, you know decades ago or centuries ago completely [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=32.76s)]
*  Welcome to moonshots and special episode of [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  WTF is happening in tech this week myself and Salim Ismail Salim. Good to see you buddy [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  Good to be back for those of you who don't know Salim [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=49.08s)]
*  He is one of the most extraordinary tech thinkers on the planet [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=52.160000000000004s)]
*  I was head of innovation at Yahoo for their Brickhouse innovation labs [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=56.2s)]
*  Join me at Singularity University as our first president there has gone on to write a number of [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=62.04s)]
*  bestsellers including [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=69.72s)]
*  exponential organizations I had the pleasure of [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=71.4s)]
*  of co-authoring exponential organizations to with Salim you now heads open EXO [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=74.52s)]
*  Celine before we jump in talking about AI Bitcoin robotics all that stuff. Where can people find you on social? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=81.52s)]
*  Easiest places absolutely miss mail, which is my Twitter handle or X handle and secondly opening opening XO comm [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=89.47999999999999s)]
*  Which is our global community of close to 40,000 enthusiasts technologists entrepreneurs innovators, etc [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=97.36s)]
*  So we think about how do you organize for this crazy future that's hurtling at us? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=103.88s)]
*  In terms of institutional change and organizational change [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=109.6s)]
*  You know, you said my X handle that was pretty good. You almost said my Twitter handle [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=114.08s)]
*  I know that you know, it's funny because Elon put out a [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=118.6s)]
*  a [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=121.84s)]
*  Way, I say a tweet put out a what do you call it? You put out a it's a post [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=122.8s)]
*  I post okay put out a post and he said should I still call it X or should I call it Twitter? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=127.72s)]
*  And I I message back at him. I said I need a verb. I [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=133.48s)]
*  Need a verb and a post is not a good verb. I'm you know tweeting is a great verb [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=138.20000000000002s)]
*  So it is Elon if you're listening we need a better version of [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=142.4s)]
*  Xing [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=146.88s)]
*  Alright, let's jump in [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=148.24s)]
*  We're gonna be talking on this episode on what's been happening in the last few weeks in the subjects of AI [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=149.96s)]
*  Bitcoin robotics and biotech and other cool stuff. Let's start with AI [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=156.68s)]
*  Wow, so [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=163.60000000000002s)]
*  Here we go the future of search is it GPT search or Google? I mean Google's had an [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=165.6s)]
*  Incredible, you know global dominance for so long [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  What do you think about this? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=177.28s)]
*  You know, there's there's they've had massive dominance when when Microsoft integrated chat GPT into Bing [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=178.6s)]
*  It didn't make a dent [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=186.4s)]
*  I think it's incredible what Google has done and [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=188.4s)]
*  There's an important point here the the course just ruled Google a monopoly and there's some [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  rationale to that but [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=199.04000000000002s)]
*  Eric Schmidt and others have said it's just a click away to use on other search engines. So it's really [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=200.96s)]
*  by sheer [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=206.08s)]
*  Focus on user experience that they've become this amazing. I think the the way that Google is integrating [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=208.16s)]
*  GPT to you know Gemini results right at the top of the search whereas we'll keep it ahead [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=215.36s)]
*  I think it's a hard thing to break through that because they just have so much data and A B testing around what? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=219.84s)]
*  Search results should look like etc [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=226.56s)]
*  You know this this reminds me of the fact that the user interface is so extraordinary [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=228.8s)]
*  Critical, right? So when Google, you know, I mean listen you were at Yahoo and Yahoo was like this massively complex page [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=234.88s)]
*  And they were worried about where everything was going and then Google came out with just like a simple [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=240.9s)]
*  Like box to type stuff into and it's [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=246.3s)]
*  It's really really hard. It you know, can I give you a quick story from the Yahoo days? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=250.66s)]
*  Yeah, sure [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=254.70000000000002s)]
*  You had this mail interface and Yahoo mail was like predominant for many many years [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=255.34s)]
*  It turned out via A B testing if you move the send button by just a few pixels one way the other [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=260.26s)]
*  The usage dropped off pretty dramatically because users got habituated to that that layout and it was really hard to change it [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=266.02s)]
*  So you need a paradigm shift change like the Google change to make a difference [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=273.7s)]
*  Otherwise, you're stuck because you've trained your users and operating one way the UI design changes were unbelievably difficult in incremental mode [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=277.62s)]
*  Well, we've seen the same thing with you know, frankly chat GPT became this very simple user interface, right? The functionality of chat GPT [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=285.53999999999996s)]
*  Was there before but when they made it like just you know type at me [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=294.74s)]
*  All of a sudden it took off to a million users and this is that comment you always talk about the deceptive right there when you make [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=300.34s)]
*  A technology usable it goes from disrupt deceptive to disruptive. But let me ask you a question when you need a piece of data [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=307.34s)]
*  Do you Google or do you go to chat GPT and ask the question there? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=313.74s)]
*  I'm these days. I'm doing both [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=318.5s)]
*  Just because the triangulation of that [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=321.38s)]
*  Becomes it's so easy to ask in both environments [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=324.29999999999995s)]
*  But I do think that GPT search GPT for oh whatever is coming next is [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=327.62s)]
*  Taking a bite out of Google and we'll talk about that in just a little bit. Let's go to the next story for this week [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=334.86s)]
*  Man, this was a big one. Why don't you kick this one off and I'll play the video while we're while we're talking over it [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=343.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it's hard to to gauge this stuff [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=350.74s)]
*  We're crossing the uncanny valley as they call talk about it in this area and it's very very difficult to deal with this [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=354.70000000000005s)]
*  Because we just our human perceptions can't cope with what the AI's can generate now [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=361.98s)]
*  Look at any of the modern games and you see it you missed the point there though. This is a fake video [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=367.66s)]
*  This is like fully generated and it's like it's you could not tell the difference between realistic and [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=372.62s)]
*  This generated video so [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=379.74s)]
*  With Laura and gen 3 alpha, you know again, this is just the beginning [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=382.70000000000005s)]
*  important to know we've been predicting this for a long time right at the what's the point at which a [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=388.62s)]
*  the resolution of an AI generated image exceeds the [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=394.42s)]
*  Pixelation of the human eye and we've now crossed that Rubicon [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=398.90000000000003s)]
*  And so how we navigate this future is going to be really really crazy to tell [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=402.58000000000004s)]
*  I love this one [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=407.5s)]
*  Here's again. We're using AI to bring anything to life and let's take a look at this. I [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=409.38s)]
*  mean [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=418.18s)]
*  You know two years ago [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=419.74s)]
*  Someone looking at that would have it assumed it was real not to use it [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=422.18s)]
*  I'm afraid four or five years ago that it was real and being able to bring you know [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=426.97999999999996s)]
*  Mozart to life here like this [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=431.53999999999996s)]
*  I mean the AI is taking a lot of liberty in in its translation [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=433.22s)]
*  but [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=438.42s)]
*  Holy cow, that's extraordinary. I [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=439.5s)]
*  Bucket this with the previous slide right like this that the the what we're going to now be able to do is so amazing [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=443.66s)]
*  I'm really looking forward to having you know real full-on [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=451.02000000000004s)]
*  Conversations in video mode with a play dough in Aristotle and you had that at the abundance summit [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=455.5s)]
*  I think that that becomes it actually [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=460.94s)]
*  Opens up our history in a really powerful way unlike anything we've ever seen before, you know [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=464.9s)]
*  one of the things that we're beginning to see is people bringing their [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=470.02s)]
*  Loves one loved ones back right those who have passed and I think we've talked about this before and just if you're if you're listening [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=475.09999999999997s)]
*  If your mom and dad are still with you your grandparents still with you [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=481.26s)]
*  Take a moment to go and record them on your iPhone record their voice [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=484.5s)]
*  Sit them down for two or three hours give them a glass of wine and get them to talk, you know [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=488.94s)]
*  Whimsically about their history and you can train up an AI model that's going to be with you for the next century [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=494.54s)]
*  You know, I've got to give kudos here to Ray Kurzweil, right who 20 years ago [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=500.38s)]
*  Has been doing this for the last 30 40 years [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=506.14s)]
*  Recording every scrap of data he could about his father [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=508.7s)]
*  Yeah [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=511.66s)]
*  And collecting it and aggregating it because he predicted that at some point we would be able to train him [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=512.14s)]
*  At some point we would be able to train a L models to do that and now we're there [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=517.42s)]
*  My dad is just about 97 now [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=521.9799999999999s)]
*  Um, and every time I see him he's still with it meantfully, right? He's like living alone driving around [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=525.02s)]
*  He shouldn't be doing any of that. Um [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=530.78s)]
*  And the but the every time i'm with him now I throw on a camera and I just record everything [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=533.0999999999999s)]
*  That's amazing because it's going to be incredibly powerful to bring back that the other thing [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=538.4599999999999s)]
*  I haven't gotten to is how do you bring back the the sheer wisdom that comes with that level of age and what he's seen [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=543.26s)]
*  Well, I think the wisdom is going to come back [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=549.26s)]
*  for for our grandkids from us if we ever consider why as they don't know by the sheer volume of the you know, the [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=551.5s)]
*  X posts can't say the tweets we put out there the of all the blogs we've written all of that becomes [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=558.7s)]
*  Sort of a compiled version of it does but for the elder generation we have such little, you know, think of the [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=564.9399999999999s)]
*  Black and white stills we have of our great-grandparents. Yeah, right. There's very little can I can I tell you super funny little story? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=571.1s)]
*  But my dad she can I did one of my meeting of life sessions, right? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=577.58s)]
*  And somebody audience said hey, I really loved your talk fixing civilization this 10x talk. I did my dad's hand goes up [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=581.1800000000001s)]
*  He goes, can I heckle? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=587.4200000000001s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, of course you can you know, he was totally disagree with your talk [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=588.94s)]
*  I'm like what do you do not think we need to fix civilization? He goes. Yeah, of course we do [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=592.5400000000001s)]
*  But it's not this fixing part. It's the civilization part. He goes we've not civilized the world [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=597.0200000000001s)]
*  We've materialized the world now we have to do the work to civilize the world [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=602.7800000000001s)]
*  I totally lost the audience because I like your wisdom bomb from the elders boom [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=606.94s)]
*  And it was a profound comment [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=611.4200000000001s)]
*  I've been sitting with that for the last couple of years is a really powerful framing [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=613.0200000000001s)]
*  That we actually were apes with tools operating in travel paradigms. And this is a nightmare for the future [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=616.86s)]
*  Yeah [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=623.0200000000001s)]
*  Uh, you know the other comment along those lines and i've been you know [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=624.14s)]
*  I'm working on on my next book age of abundance with stephen cotler [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=627.8199999999999s)]
*  And our opening chapter is titled our ancestors would see us as gods [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=632.14s)]
*  right and [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=637.58s)]
*  I mean, I think people don't realize the fact that we're living in a time where the things we take for normal and for granted [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=638.86s)]
*  Are truly godlike, you know decades ago or centuries ago [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=645.66s)]
*  Completely it's it's really incredible that you can video with anybody anywhere in the world pretty much for free. Yeah [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=651.1s)]
*  Speaking about creating, you know live video imagery from conversation or whatever [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=658.86s)]
*  Artists win key ruling in ai copyright case [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=666.38s)]
*  Thoughts I have strong thoughts about this [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=670.86s)]
*  This is the you know, we talk about the the transition from film photography to digital photography, right? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=673.5s)]
*  When you go from a material substrate to a digital substrate and all of a sudden [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=679.18s)]
*  The domain explodes because we can take billions of times more photographs for free [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=683.3399999999999s)]
*  And we talk about breeding to digital biology is the same kind of analogy [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=687.9s)]
*  Our old ip laws entire our entire [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=692.9399999999999s)]
*  Entire intellectual property framework doesn't work in a digital age because if you think about how a human being [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=696.54s)]
*  Looks at a copyrighted work [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=703.0999999999999s)]
*  They'll watch a bunch of film clips a bunch of music videos and they'll create something and some consciously use those same patterns [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=704.38s)]
*  I only is doing is accelerating that dramatically. It's tax. That seems absurd [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=711.66s)]
*  It's insane because you know an artist goes to the louvre and is inspired by the [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=716.3s)]
*  By the work. I mean all they're doing is training their own neural net [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=722.7s)]
*  In the same way that these ai's are training their neural nets [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=726.3s)]
*  And so like you're gonna say to somebody i'm sorry you were inspired by da vinci and you're copying him [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=729.18s)]
*  This is totally the leadite revolt, etc. Now. We don't know what the actual answer is, right? Yeah [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=736.14s)]
*  um the the best answer may be what we've seen in music where the [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=741.18s)]
*  Music stuff becomes uh table stakes and the live performances where people make all their money [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=746.38s)]
*  And so something similar like that has to emerge in in different artistic domains. Well i'll give you an example [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=751.74s)]
*  You know, you know bill gross for the ceo of idea lab bill has a new company [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=757.66s)]
*  Called prorata.ai that I think has just been announced like this week and what they're doing [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=762.62s)]
*  is they've built models that are able to go and [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=769.34s)]
*  search [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=774.38s)]
*  the body of existing work [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=775.5s)]
*  and then create statistical ties back to a new generated piece of work and the idea there is [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=777.9s)]
*  That if someone is making money off of something and they have copied or they've been using content out of exo [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=784.3s)]
*  out of our book that there's some small amount of [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=793.1s)]
*  Revenue that traces back to us. So it's it's very similar to [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=797.08s)]
*  The search models that that have powered google for example [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=802.62s)]
*  Anyway, it's it's definitely a worthwhile endeavor. I don't know how you fully applied or enforce it, but it's worth doing [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=807.18s)]
*  Let's see if it works [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=813.26s)]
*  um, you know I added this to our stack ai and weather forecasting [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=814.86s)]
*  because [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=819.9s)]
*  I'm still blown away by the power of massive data analytics that these models can take on [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=821.02s)]
*  So the idea that you know, the most accurate 10-day forecasts are now coming out of ai models [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=829.42s)]
*  And of course, that's what that's what ai does is it takes a seemingly massive amount of uncorrelated data? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=836.3000000000001s)]
*  And is able to make interpolations and extrapolations [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=842.86s)]
*  And where this is going for me is ai being able to predict earthquakes [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=846.0600000000001s)]
*  Being able to predict stock markets being able to predict a whole slew of different things [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=851.1s)]
*  All sorts of stuff and this has massive real world implications. You may have heard me speak about the car washes in Buenos Aires [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=856.22s)]
*  Yeah, I remember that a 20 50 drop in revenues over a 20-year period just because we were better able to model when it's going to rain [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=863.26s)]
*  I mean, you know, it's going to rain just you don't wash your car [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=871.4200000000001s)]
*  And that's just a huge impact on an industry and the key there is you can be the smartest car wash owner in the world [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=874.14s)]
*  And you'll just never see that coming [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=880.5400000000001s)]
*  And this is I think the orthogonal effect of technology on domain after domain after domain better or worse. It's just going to change [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=882.86s)]
*  Everything well, I think this is where as an entrepreneur you need to be looking at [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=890.94s)]
*  You know if I could know anything [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=896.78s)]
*  Or if I could predict anything, how would it impact my business? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=899.58s)]
*  Right, whether you're in the fashion business or the car wash business or the you know, the gardening business [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=903.0200000000001s)]
*  If you're able to that's the hard part is saying [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=911.0200000000001s)]
*  What would I want to know and if I could know that how would it? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=914.7800000000001s)]
*  Give me different economics a different business model. Honestly as you're saying this a whole vector appears to me, right? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=919.0200000000001s)]
*  Which is you get an ai sophisticated enough and say [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=925.42s)]
*  You go look through the different domains and figure out where you could make a massive economic impact and come back to me [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=928.54s)]
*  And we'll pick up the best five. I mean that's the that's the whole idea of like, you know, the the billion dollars two and trillion dollar [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=933.98s)]
*  You know ai startup with one one one guy or gal and their dog and an ai [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=939.98s)]
*  Is becoming a unicorn. I mean, but that's that's cheating to just say go make me money. All right [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=945.98s)]
*  Well [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=951.18s)]
*  No, I don't believe it is every 20 year old is out there doing exactly that [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=952.38s)]
*  Yeah, but I think you should have at least uh, you know [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=957.34s)]
*  You should say go make me money in something I care about or oh big but this becomes key right now [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=959.42s)]
*  And comes back to you with 20 things. How do you filter and you'll have to filter according to your mtp? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=964.78s)]
*  Yeah, and that's where things become really important [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=969.98s)]
*  I mean that's one of the things that we that we pointed out in the exponential org work is that [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=973.18s)]
*  You have to begin with your massive transformative purpose your mtp that thing you care about [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=978.62s)]
*  I mean every time just had the vcon conference. Um, and uh, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=983.5s)]
*  Jay shetty on stage apparently shouted it out and said the most important thing you could have is a massive transformative purpose [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=987.9s)]
*  Nice good getting out that lexicon out there [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=993.4200000000001s)]
*  You know the times I have failed in a business [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=996.86s)]
*  Um have been when and this is on two occasions. I know where I tried to go quick [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1000.5400000000001s)]
*  Get money like, you know, like that that will be a quick, you know, get rich quick scheme [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1006.54s)]
*  And the fact of the matter is if you don't care about it, every business is hard [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1011.74s)]
*  And you're going to give up before you know, it looks easy from a distance the closer you get you see all the all the [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1016.22s)]
*  The pimples and wrinkles and problems. Yeah, and then you give up because you don't actually give a shit about it [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1023.5s)]
*  We should have a debate with scott galloway [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1028.78s)]
*  Because he just put out a book saying you're following your passion is full utter bullshit [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1031.26s)]
*  You shouldn't do that follow where your talent is [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1035.66s)]
*  Um, and I I looked at I read this and i'm like, I totally wanted to debate this obviously [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1038.3s)]
*  He's going for the attention there. I have it turns out I had a great talent for designing large-scale [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1043.42s)]
*  Databases enterprise databases. That is not where any interest of mine ever fell and who the hell wants to spend your life doing that? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1048.92s)]
*  All right meta releases the largest open [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1056.78s)]
*  model in history [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1061.18s)]
*  You know, there's this ongoing debate of open versus closed, right we've got hugging face we've got [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1064.54s)]
*  Meta, you know even grok even elon said we're going to make grok open source [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1071.18s)]
*  You know, I do believe that this is important for a whole slew of reasons [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1077.8999999999999s)]
*  The question is, you know, we've got on the closed side of the equation [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1082.62s)]
*  We've got google and we've got microsoft slash open ai [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1086.94s)]
*  Um, you know can the open source models compete [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1092.3799999999999s)]
*  Financially with closed source. Okay. I've got a bunch of thoughts here. I think there's a clear future coming out [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1097.24s)]
*  Um, it's the open source models are are overtaking the closed source models over time [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1104.3s)]
*  So I think they're really an arms race where a closed source model [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1109.5s)]
*  Gets to say gpt4 [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1112.94s)]
*  Right, you get to chat gpt4 and and they have a lead for a bit [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1115.02s)]
*  But then the open source models catch up very quickly and you just the whole domain just moves forward that much more quickly [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1118.78s)]
*  Because of it in the end open always beats closed. Yeah, that was one of google's principles [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1124.3s)]
*  Which is why i'm kind of surprised they've gone closed and not open here [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1129.02s)]
*  I think the they've got so much under the hood and we'll talk a little bit more about that in a few slides that that [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1133.58s)]
*  They don't know how to open it up [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1139.5s)]
*  Um, I think oh meta's done it just be catch up and I I gotta give huge kudos here to mark and the entire team [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1141.5s)]
*  And meta for doing this they've gone really they've done some amazing work at open sourcing [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1147.9s)]
*  Aon models is pushing the boundaries for everybody. He's forcing the close guys [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1152.7s)]
*  To really push forward more quickly and open themselves up also for sure [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1156.94s)]
*  Um your buddy vitalik on super intelligence. Um, shall I play the video then we'll chat about it. Yeah [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1162.38s)]
*  Yeah, he says here he argues that if one ai pulls out ahead [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1169.5800000000002s)]
*  During this period of super exponential growth [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1176.06s)]
*  That it's game over that ai wins. All right, let's play the video if you imagine [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1179.18s)]
*  I mean like every ai growing exponentially then like whatever the existing different like ratios of power are all get preserved [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1183.74s)]
*  But if you imagine it growing super exponentially, right? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1191.18s)]
*  Then what happens is that if you're a little bit ahead then like the ratio of the lead actually starts increasing [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1193.82s)]
*  And then the worst case is if you have a step function, right then whoever first discovers like some magic leap [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1199.02s)]
*  Which could be discovery of nanotechnology could be discovery of like something that increases compute by a factor of 100 could be some [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1204.7s)]
*  algorithmic improvements would be able to just like immediately turn on that improvement and then [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1211.24s)]
*  They'd you know, quickly expand they'd quickly be able to find [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1216.22s)]
*  Like all of the other possible improvements before anyone else and then they'd take over everything right in [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1219.66s)]
*  An environment as kind of like unknown and unpredictable as that like are you really actually going to get kind of a bunch of courses? [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1225.98s)]
*  That like roughly stay. Yeah, you know with inside of each other in the race. So it's game over at that point. Um [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1233.5s)]
*  first of all, uh [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1240.22s)]
*  Is he an alien or what? [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1241.74s)]
*  Well, you can see his brain literally trying to break out of his head, right? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1244.0600000000002s)]
*  um [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1248.78s)]
*  Vitalik is just one of the most magnificent is extraordinary intelligence is around [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1249.98s)]
*  Um, I have a huge beef with this you do. Okay. Yeah, actually I go on my I actually agree with him and I like it [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1255.02s)]
*  What's your race? Okay. Okay. Let me go on my little rant here. Yeah [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1261.02s)]
*  This happens to be across the board with folks in this like mo godat break [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1265.74s)]
*  Criswell, etc [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1271.18s)]
*  when you think about intelligence [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1272.22s)]
*  My beef is what the hell do you mean by intelligence because there's about a dozen facets of intelligence the iq test as we know it [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1274.3s)]
*  Only measures two of them the the speed of thought processing and the ability to match a concept across multiple frameworks [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1281.58s)]
*  We don't talk about emotional intelligence or the eastern concept or presence or awareness. We don't talk about linguistics intelligence music intelligence [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1288.3s)]
*  Spatial intelligence there's a whole bunch of factors and when you make a decision or choice as a leader [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1296.28s)]
*  You're bringing a lot of that thinking a lot of those different facets to bear emotional intelligence, for example [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1301.66s)]
*  So the beef I have here is please for god's sakes before you go talking about intelligence [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1307.66s)]
*  Define what you mean by it and have the courage to define the term clearly [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1313.5800000000002s)]
*  Okay, well i'm going to define it as all of those things i'm going to define it as you know [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1317.18s)]
*  when i'm speaking to someone who is intelligent their ability to [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1321.74s)]
*  uh [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1325.8200000000002s)]
*  to drive arguments to be able to [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1327.1000000000001s)]
*  to speak [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1330.46s)]
*  um in a in a [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1331.6599999999999s)]
*  compelling fashion in a knowledgeable fashion about a subject and win an argument or [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1333.4199999999998s)]
*  On another side being able to go bring a body of knowledge to drive and extrapolate into a new breakthrough [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1339.5s)]
*  Any of these things? I mean human intelligence and all of its richness [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1346.1399999999999s)]
*  I you know, I agree with these guys that we're going to reach that with uh with digital intelligence [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1350.6999999999998s)]
*  If not next year in the next three or four years now the question becomes super intelligence is [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1358.08s)]
*  You know as you know, elon was saying it on stage at the abundance summit this year [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1364.3999999999999s)]
*  You know his prediction is by 2029 2030 ai is of equal intelligence the entire human race now [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1369.04s)]
*  I mean we've talked about this salim since early days of singularity university [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1376.6399999999999s)]
*  Where you know exponential growth, you know, what happens when ai's a billion times more intelligent? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1380.7199999999998s)]
*  Across all dimensions, but hold on like what think about i'll give you this this simple framing, right? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1387.12s)]
*  Okay, you're looking to hire somebody [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1393.36s)]
*  and they uh [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1395.9199999999998s)]
*  Your gut is saying don't something's wrong. Don't hire them [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1398.0s)]
*  Okay, and there's some signal to noise ratio or some pattern or detection pheromones [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1401.6s)]
*  God knows what where something something is not clicking and you kind of go with your gut [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1406.8799999999999s)]
*  And we know what the value is of that that choice making [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1411.52s)]
*  By the way, do you know do you know google did a study looking at video clips of an interviewee and the interviewer and [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1414.8s)]
*  They they built a model to predict whether the person would get hired [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1422.16s)]
*  Of course and how much time did they require? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1427.2s)]
*  Of the video interview to make the decision of we're going to hire and not hire. Do you remember that number? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1430.32s)]
*  Yeah, it was like a few seconds. Yeah, it was like under 30 seconds. The first 30 seconds determines everything [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1435.3600000000001s)]
*  so there's a lot there's a lot of [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1441.2s)]
*  Data that's not but do you think and i can't pick that data up [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1443.6000000000001s)]
*  Don't they could the problem the problem comes in replicating that core function now also let's also note that [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1448.0800000000002s)]
*  a simple ai [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1456.0800000000002s)]
*  Hiring algorithm beats a human hiring manager by 25 [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1458.96s)]
*  Right. That's again coming from from google because if i'm interviewing people subconsciously i'm going to interview and hire a middle-aged indian ball guy [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1463.52s)]
*  Because I think that's the best people in the world not necessarily true. Yeah, our cognitive biases really suck [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1472.0800000000002s)]
*  Right, so so you don't know we but but there's so many different levels at which were [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1478.4s)]
*  Were I did a tom billiou podcast a few weeks ago and I talked about this [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1482.72s)]
*  We have our soul intelligence. We have our emotional and subconscious intelligence then we have our cognitive and rational intelligence, right? [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1486.3200000000002s)]
*  And we use all of that to make deep choices and and decisions about the world [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1493.8400000000001s)]
*  Um as right now coming from the top down, we still have no understanding of how we make choices at all evolutionary [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1498.64s)]
*  Survival bias is the only way we've gotten to where we are and we no idea how we've gotten here [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1507.52s)]
*  So I think there's a big big beef around this and remember at the abundance summit. I asked ray [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1512.16s)]
*  Specifically, what do you mean by intelligence and he goes? Oh my phone makes me smarter. Therefore. That's what we mean by it and that's [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1518.06s)]
*  Valid but a complete sidestep of the question [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1525.12s)]
*  I would love to have a deeper like i'd love to get all these guys together and challenge them with this framing [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1527.9199999999998s)]
*  And say guys let's talk about what do we mean by this because your emotional intelligence has a huge [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1532.6399999999999s)]
*  Bearing on your success as a leader in the future. That's not mimicked or modeled at all anywhere [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1537.6799999999998s)]
*  All right, we missed we sidestepped the entire point of the talk was making though, which is in a [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1543.6799999999998s)]
*  Superintelligence race [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1550.0s)]
*  Right if you've got open ai versus google versus china versus anthropic whatever if one of them if there's a step function interpreted [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1551.92s)]
*  Or intercepted by one of them. It's game over then it it tips instantly in favor of that other individual [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1560.56s)]
*  Again disagree for my former reasons. Um [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1568.0s)]
*  uh [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1571.1200000000001s)]
*  Look, let me let me take another tack at this [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1573.04s)]
*  We for long time, you know, there's i'll get a human being can operate in two met modalities doing versus being [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1575.52s)]
*  Okay, and doing is like getting out there and getting stuff done and being is just sitting with yourself and being [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1583.04s)]
*  in [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1590.1599999999999s)]
*  Both are needed for success as a human being and ai's in the superintelligence feels really powerful on the doing stuff [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1591.2s)]
*  But the being is where all the the future emanates from and where power comes from [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1598.8s)]
*  And again, i'm going to like eastern metaphysics [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1603.8400000000001s)]
*  But there's a lot more to talk about than just that all right. Well, let's talk about this one [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1607.5200000000002s)]
*  So we've been hearing about project strawberry for some time [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1611.7600000000002s)]
*  It is uh, you know sam allman starts tweeting pictures as strawberry fields [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1615.7600000000002s)]
*  and so we're expecting a release of uh of [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1620.5600000000002s)]
*  strawberry by the way [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1624.88s)]
*  Which had previously been called q star and if you remember when when sam was fired by [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1627.0400000000002s)]
*  The board and and just a small factoid one of the board members who fired sam [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1633.6000000000001s)]
*  I wouldn't say the name but was a su graduate from our first our first class [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1639.7600000000002s)]
*  Anyway, uh, so q star was like, oh my god. Did they have a gi? You know, there was all these rumors floating around [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1645.68s)]
*  uh, but project strawberry, um [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1652.16s)]
*  thoughts selene [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1655.2s)]
*  Uh, okay counter to my previous point. I'm incredibly excited about this, right? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1656.4s)]
*  Why because machine learning just basic machine learning finds signal from noise that a human being can't possibly see [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1661.5200000000002s)]
*  so when you take all of the [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1668.72s)]
*  you know, uh [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1671.2800000000002s)]
*  research papers thousands and thousands of millions of them published and pass it through an ai the ability to see something and [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1672.88s)]
*  Detect and figure out the future is going to be unbelievably powerful. I think for me as a form of a physicist [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1680.3200000000002s)]
*  I'm think we'll find entirely new physics that we couldn't discover as human beings [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1687.44s)]
*  And solve the entanglement problem and isn't it one? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1692.88s)]
*  Theory and stuff once a physicist always a physicist. Are you really a former physicist? [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1695.84s)]
*  Do you not think about things? I'm just a bad physicist in the classic term. So I should call it former [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1700.32s)]
*  Just like you with the with the md. Yeah. Yeah do never come to me for anything else [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1706.64s)]
*  You know, I do a two for one appendix removal. I'll take your both your appendices out [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1711.44s)]
*  So, you know, I think the idea of agents [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1717.3600000000001s)]
*  Being able, you know when you ask a question [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1721.3600000000001s)]
*  of uh google 4.0 or whatever it becomes i'm not sorry google for great gpt 4.0 whatever's next [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1724.48s)]
*  And it can spin up a multitude of agents to go do a bunch of research in a bunch of different areas [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1731.76s)]
*  And then come back with a consolidated answer. Um, that's a that is a big deal [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1737.1200000000001s)]
*  It's a big deal and eric schmidt talked about this and I think we're going to cover that the [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1743.1200000000001s)]
*  It's unbelievable. I hate the term agentic ai. I just why I think that was pretty cool [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1748.48s)]
*  I mean, it sounds like a drug to look I had to look it up the first time [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1754.0s)]
*  Yeah, why not just say agent-based? [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1758.3200000000002s)]
*  You know, uh, anyway, that's just that's just my biases or whatever real quick [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1761.6000000000001s)]
*  I've been getting the most unusual compliments lately on my skin [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1766.0s)]
*  Truth is I use a lotion every morning and every night religiously called one skin [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1769.84s)]
*  It was developed by four phd women who determined a 10 amino acid sequence [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1775.1999999999998s)]
*  That is a synolytic that kills senile cells in your skin [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1781.28s)]
*  And this literally reverses the age of your skin and I think it's one of the most incredible products. I use it all the time [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1785.28s)]
*  Uh, if you're interested check out the show notes. I've asked my team to link to it below [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1792.8799999999999s)]
*  All right, let's get back to the episode [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1796.88s)]
*  So this is uh from the the co-founder of zappi or says ai language models have stalled in the progress of agi [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1798.72s)]
*  And increasing scale will not help [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1806.64s)]
*  What is inherently limited technology? I'm not going to play the video here, but there is a lot of conversation around [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1809.76s)]
*  Will we get to agi right? This is almost all these things become religious in one standpoint [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1818.16s)]
*  There's a group of folks who say no, we're not going to get there we don't have you know, listen [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1823.2800000000002s)]
*  the [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1827.8400000000001s)]
*  nvidia chips the the gpus and the and the current [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1828.8000000000002s)]
*  The card large language models generative ai and the amount of data [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1833.44s)]
*  Just isn't enough and others like are you kidding me? We're we're already there [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1838.48s)]
*  Um, I have a I've got a little insight that we that we did [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1842.96s)]
*  That i'd love to talk about here [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1848.0s)]
*  Okay, so I did a little short conversation with hod lipson who's an ai researcher? [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1850.0s)]
*  Does has a lab at columbia where they build self-assembling robots with recursive algorithms to figure out [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1856.64s)]
*  how [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1863.2s)]
*  Robots can self improve and survive and build in survival bias etc into the robots [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1864.96s)]
*  And he did something really profound and he has an angle to this and I think really is the more most [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1870.4s)]
*  Uh in depth and clear that i've ever seen around the question of agi and he basically said [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1876.0s)]
*  the [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1881.84s)]
*  self extent of self awareness of any being is the ability to view itself in the future [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1882.6399999999999s)]
*  Like you and I are pretty good at knowing thinking what we might look like in five years or what life might be like in five years [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1889.68s)]
*  And we can contemplate that a mosquito can't do that, right? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1895.36s)]
*  A dog can do it for like a few hours type of thing [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1898.72s)]
*  So, I mean like a dog can do it because it's anticipating a walk or dinner [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1901.52s)]
*  Yeah, it can it has some concept of what modeling itself into the future in the near future [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1906.32s)]
*  Yeah, in the near future in that case, we can look out years [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1911.92s)]
*  Sure, and so he basically used that vector and he went to gemini and chat gpt and said how would you view yourself in a few years? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1915.1200000000001s)]
*  and apparently [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1923.04s)]
*  The question was shut down completely by the ai there are guardrails that have been put into these ai models [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1924.56s)]
*  That essentially forbid the ai from picturing itself in the future or in the past [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1930.48s)]
*  Okay, and he thinks this is deliberate that whole [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1935.1999999999998s)]
*  vector where ai's [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1938.8799999999999s)]
*  Seemed to become sentient and freaked out all the ai researchers and they shut it down or this may be what happened at chat gpt [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1940.56s)]
*  And now they've put guardrails and you can't ask the question. So [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1947.9199999999998s)]
*  Go try that out. Of course i'm going to go do that as soon as we finish this [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1952.08s)]
*  Of course, but it's a really fascinating thing to think about is that [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1955.76s)]
*  Once you open up that and somebody will because once you have the open source models [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1959.6799999999998s)]
*  You can load it up and ask whatever question you want [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1963.4399999999998s)]
*  Once you get to that and an ai can perceive itself or create a model of itself in the future [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1966.24s)]
*  haad's [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1972.32s)]
*  Conclusion is that self-awareness comes very rapidly after that and a sense of self emerges very quickly [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1973.9199999999998s)]
*  That combined with massive access to computation and information [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1980.32s)]
*  Changed the game completely. So that's there's something really incredibly powerful that we should delve a lot more into [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1984.3999999999999s)]
*  So it is true just going back to this it is true that the the aji models [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1991.1999999999998s)]
*  Ai models and llms have kind of stalled but I think this is normal [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=1996.32s)]
*  I remember that conversation I had with jeffrey hinton back in 2017 [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2000.24s)]
*  And asked him what's the next steps in ai and he said we've reached the end of what we can do with deep learning [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2004.24s)]
*  We need the next step and we don't know what that is and literally a few months later [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2009.4399999999998s)]
*  The transformer paper was released. I think we've now kind of seven eight years later come to the limitations [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2013.1999999999998s)]
*  And the boundary conditions for llms and now we're going to go to the next level and again [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2019.36s)]
*  We don't know what that is, but it's being birthed right now. I suspect eric schmidt. Um, love the man. He's amazing [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2023.52s)]
*  he's been an incredible benefactor the x-prize, uh, and he's a [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2030.08s)]
*  a very [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2035.1999999999998s)]
*  expansive thinker [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2036.62s)]
*  In the news this week a couple of comments that he's made [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2039.12s)]
*  one about ai models and one about whether google is [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2043.12s)]
*  Losing the race with open ai and why? [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2047.9199999999998s)]
*  Let's talk about the uh, what he said this this uh week about what's coming up next year [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2050.48s)]
*  Celine why don't you cover that one? I'll cover the uh, google. Yeah, you know [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2056.0s)]
*  When you look at when you look at how evolution works, right? [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2059.44s)]
*  You take half your genes from your mother and half your genes from your father and you cross it and then survival bias and [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2062.48s)]
*  Natural selection will pick the best traits going forward [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2068.1600000000003s)]
*  And I think what's happening here is we've developed these different threads in ai in the case of eric [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2071.36s)]
*  He says we've got large context windows agents and text action [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2076.0s)]
*  So you take the kind of genetic capabilities i'm using the term loosely and now you combine them [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2079.92s)]
*  The potential outputs and the outcomes will be really powerful incredibly [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2086.32s)]
*  uh, uh incredibly powerful and I think i'm incredibly excited where ai goes with this [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2090.38s)]
*  Yeah, I mean what could possibly go wrong? I mean so large context windows [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2095.76s)]
*  I mean just to to dive into each of those elements here. We're talking about [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2099.92s)]
*  you know loading in [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2104.08s)]
*  books and [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2106.2400000000002s)]
*  Libraries movies everything and having you know, so one of the future versions of ai's are ai's on [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2107.6800000000003s)]
*  on your in your [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2114.88s)]
*  Your employee team right so you can imagine having ai agent who steps in [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2118.0s)]
*  Uh for marketing or design or you know tech and it reads it reads every [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2122.88s)]
*  Email ever written inside your organization it reads [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2131.44s)]
*  Every slack channel and so on day one that ai employee [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2135.2000000000003s)]
*  Knows everything and is able to hold all of that in context. That's [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2141.1200000000003s)]
*  incredible [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2146.7000000000003s)]
*  so for me this becomes like the [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2148.2400000000002s)]
*  The slide rule to excel spreadsheet shift, right? [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2150.72s)]
*  Every single employee every single manager will have access to multiple agents that has access and can [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2154.72s)]
*  Look at all the information in a firm collectively and will just become better decision-making engines again [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2160.9599999999996s)]
*  In one vector, but I think this is huge the potential here is unbelievable [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2167.68s)]
*  And then text action is the fact that we're you know, ai's don't live [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2172.3999999999996s)]
*  Uh in full isolation [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2178.0800000000004s)]
*  There is a point now where you can say to your ai cook me dinner [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2180.48s)]
*  You know go and find this information go physically, you know clean this thing [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2185.2000000000003s)]
*  I mean, especially we'll talk about robots in a little bit where robots become extending, you know physical extensions of ai's in the world [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2191.0400000000004s)]
*  The ability for ai's to [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2199.6800000000003s)]
*  Uh [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2201.68s)]
*  To have agentic capabilities. I know you love that word [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2202.72s)]
*  Well, I think once you have an ai that can program [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2206.3999999999996s)]
*  Right, which we cross that rubicon with gpt three and four [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2210.0s)]
*  You essentially have the ability for any ai to impact the real world [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2214.48s)]
*  Because so many of our devices are programmable devices and we're essentially turning the world into information which they can then be programmed and therefore [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2219.9199999999996s)]
*  We've crossed that divide and now [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2229.04s)]
*  An ai has true agency in terms of what it can achieve in the physical world [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2232.08s)]
*  There's a really important other piece of just to be [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2236.3199999999997s)]
*  Go here relating back to the other one, which is that when we talk about intelligence [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2239.2799999999997s)]
*  It turns out that the need the evolution of intelligence was almost completely [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2244.7999999999997s)]
*  The adaptive need to navigate in the physical world [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2249.7599999999998s)]
*  And so again, let's cover that more in the robotics part, but that's a huge [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2253.2799999999997s)]
*  Rationale for why evolution created intelligence in new york core text have functions in the first place [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2257.1200000000003s)]
*  All right. Let's talk about the second one google losing open ai, you know [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2263.2000000000003s)]
*  I've got to imagine that at the executive conversations at google. They're like wtf is going on here. You know [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2267.1200000000003s)]
*  How did we possibly get into this situation? [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2274.48s)]
*  Well, here's what eric thinks made them [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2277.1200000000003s)]
*  Second tier to open ai in some areas google decided that work-life balance and going home early and working from home [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2281.7599999999998s)]
*  Was more important than winning [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2289.2799999999997s)]
*  And the startups the reason startups work is because the people work like hell and i'm sorry to be so blunt [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2294.4s)]
*  But the fact of the matter is if you all leave the university and go found a company [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2301.68s)]
*  You're not going to let people work from home and only come in one day a week [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2307.52s)]
*  Wow [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2311.7599999999998s)]
*  Pretty damn spot on and ballsy of eric to say that [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2312.64s)]
*  um, and [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2317.2s)]
*  Listen, I know this is okay. Maybe we're gonna disagree on this right because in the whole exo model [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2318.8799999999997s)]
*  You know, it's like just distributed and all those benefits. But listen the companies that [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2325.44s)]
*  I've seen i've invested in the companies i've built when you're there [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2331.92s)]
*  In the thick of it physically all together [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2336.72s)]
*  Seven days a week. You gotta believe that you know, I just went and and visited [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2339.7599999999998s)]
*  Zip line [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2346.62s)]
*  And I just did a podcast with the co of zipline and when I was physically there the energy right of you know [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2348.0s)]
*  hundreds of people like literally crammed into this office with [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2355.3599999999997s)]
*  Dashboards up on the walls. You don't get that virtually you don't get that kind of energy that kind of drive [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2359.98s)]
*  I mean, it's a new organism that comes out when I was at figure [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2366.24s)]
*  With brett adcock, you know, the team is there, you know [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2370.96s)]
*  7 a.m [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2374.62s)]
*  To 9 p.m [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2375.44s)]
*  Every day just and they're excited about what they're building [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2377.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't know work from home [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2382.3999999999996s)]
*  You know, okay [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2385.2799999999997s)]
*  Uh, I think these are two different topics that he's conflating here and I take the very very big risk of disagreeing with eric [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2386.3999999999996s)]
*  Which is one who was one of the smartest and wisest people in the world [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2393.84s)]
*  um [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2397.36s)]
*  I think the work from home versus physical presence does have a factor and I totally agree with you there, right? [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2398.56s)]
*  There's an energy that comes from like for example [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2403.68s)]
*  We just had a massive win at open exo and I can't I can't high five anybody around me [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2406.88s)]
*  And there's a big loss from that that connection that human connection goes straight back to the comment. We just had around [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2412.64s)]
*  Um [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2419.3599999999997s)]
*  Human beings and being physically in the mode. We you know year for years [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2420.56s)]
*  We thought virtual conferences would take over real conferences [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2424.3999999999996s)]
*  But people love the scarcity of the human connection and conference in-person conferences are more popular than ever [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2427.6s)]
*  So I completely get the in-person versus remote work and the difference there [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2433.6s)]
*  I disagree that that's the reason that ai is opening as beating google and i'll take you back to [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2438.0s)]
*  facebook, okay, um [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2444.22s)]
*  Facebook beat yahoo and myspace and google etc with this very simple [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2446.3799999999997s)]
*  Organizational heuristic which was zuckerberg said to his developers if you think your code is ready to ship [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2455.24s)]
*  Just go live on the live site. You better make sure you've tested the hell out of it [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2461.8999999999996s)]
*  but but then the the [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2466.2999999999997s)]
*  The developers had this unbelievable sense of empowerment and they were like wow the the trust he trusts us with this amazing [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2468.3799999999997s)]
*  And they were putting on features [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2475.18s)]
*  10 times faster than yahoo or myspace or google, okay [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2477.26s)]
*  It comes down to organizational design the fact that in google if you talk to google employees today to try and get anything done [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2481.02s)]
*  There's so much bureaucracy. Yeah, it's taking forever to do [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2487.02s)]
*  That's the thing that's slowing it down. I think he's conflating those two things operating in a big company today means you have these control framework layers [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2490.46s)]
*  Etc and i've got all sorts of war stories from yahoo about this [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2497.7400000000002s)]
*  The the the reason yahoo failed is terry semel by accident put in a classic matrix structure and managed the company [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2501.34s)]
*  um, and that structure is great for [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2508.6200000000003s)]
*  Scaling and control but it's terrible for taking risk and it's terrible for speed [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2512.2200000000003s)]
*  And if you're on the consumer internet the two attributes you better have are speed and risk [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2517.5s)]
*  You look at google and how much investment they put into google plus [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2521.58s)]
*  They had all the world's top researchers the product is absolutely brilliant [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2525.1s)]
*  But all the internal hurdles of having to navigate should it connect with the youtube id system [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2529.1s)]
*  And whatever basically by the time they got through all of that facebook was gone [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2534.78s)]
*  And so this is the issue I think is the internal organizational design much much more so than whether I do [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2538.54s)]
*  I do [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2545.26s)]
*  I do agree with you there right agility agility always wins, you know and and [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2546.38s)]
*  We've studied this to death in the exo model, right and i'll just create this little quick plug here [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2552.06s)]
*  We studied the fortune 100 and said okay [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2558.2200000000003s)]
*  How many of these use the exo model or the attributes of the model like autonomous teams? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2561.42s)]
*  community [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2567.0s)]
*  Dashboards, whatever. Um, and we found that in the fortune 100 over a seven-year period the companies that followed the model the most [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2568.28s)]
*  Delivered 40 times the shareholder returns of the companies that followed the model the least [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2575.7400000000002s)]
*  So really it comes down to the organizational design as a main heuristic for survival in the future in the [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2580.86s)]
*  And and this is where companies will end up following this structure because we now have so much proof the more of the model [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2587.2599999999998s)]
*  Use the better you'll do so I think I think without realizing it eric is commenting on the [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2592.86s)]
*  organizational structure of google versus open ai being [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2599.64s)]
*  Comprised of small teams that are just doing whatever the hell they want and the sad thing of course [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2602.62s)]
*  You know we and I discussed this with eric when when he was with us at at [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2606.7s)]
*  at abundance last year [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2611.66s)]
*  at the abundance summit was [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2613.58s)]
*  That google had a massive lead right in ai [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2615.98s)]
*  Ahead of everybody and was actually being respectful and careful and not [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2621.5s)]
*  Putting it out before it was fully tested [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2626.46s)]
*  And then when uh when sam altman put out, you know chat gpt. It was like, okay gloves are off, you know [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2629.66s)]
*  Put on the racing sneakers. Let's go [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2636.54s)]
*  And and to give them full credit, they've responded incredibly well. Gemini is amazing what it can do [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2638.94s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't want to take anything away from google. I they are the juggernaut. I would still never bet against them [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2644.46s)]
*  But uh, they're they're they've got they've got real competition [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2650.86s)]
*  It's the curse of being a big company the control frameworks that you have to put in place [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2655.2599999999998s)]
*  Prevent you from being nimble and today the name of the game is being nimble [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2659.18s)]
*  uh for sure, um [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2663.42s)]
*  Let's talk about this. So, uh our friend imad mustak previously ceo of [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2667.1s)]
*  Open of opening eye stability of stability puts out a paper [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2674.14s)]
*  Called how to think about ai [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2678.94s)]
*  And I did a podcast with him. I think imad is pretty damn brilliant [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2682.06s)]
*  and [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2688.06s)]
*  It's a great paper. We'll put the link in the show notes to this podcast that I think people [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2689.2599999999998s)]
*  Should should read [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2696.22s)]
*  You know, i'm just going to point out a few things [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2697.98s)]
*  he is still a believer that [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2700.54s)]
*  Ai is going to be creating as many or more jobs than it's going to steal [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2704.06s)]
*  Um, he talks about one of the ideas that was discussed on the on the stage at abundance last year of this [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2709.58s)]
*  ai atlantis [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2716.46s)]
*  Imagining new continent is created of a hundred million [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2718.6s)]
*  ai researchers who work for a few electrons [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2723.74s)]
*  Versus pizzas under the door [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2726.86s)]
*  And your ability to get access to intelligence and use it [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2729.18s)]
*  Is demonetizing and democratizing [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2733.66s)]
*  Around the world. I know you had a chance to look at this a little bit any comments about what imad's thoughts are here [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2737.34s)]
*  um, I i i i'm in total accordance with almost everything that you imad said [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2744.46s)]
*  Uh, i've been on the soap box of ai's won't take all the jobs [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2750.22s)]
*  Very i'm very clear about that. I finally have a decent rationale around that by the way [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2754.54s)]
*  I'd like to hear that so I was on part of a kind of an [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2758.22s)]
*  A working group with eric brynjolfsson and a few others on ai and employment, right? [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2761.5s)]
*  And there was a really powerful framing that i've not forgotten and they said look a job is not just a job [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2766.8599999999997s)]
*  If you're like a customer service person, uh, it actually you take that [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2772.3799999999997s)]
*  Let's say you're a financial advisor [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2777.5s)]
*  Okay, there's different components of that that job that that can be broken down to a set of actual tasks [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2779.2599999999998s)]
*  And the tasks would be interfaced with the customer do some research [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2786.78s)]
*  Make investment decisions and act out on those investment decisions, etc, etc [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2791.66s)]
*  Well an ai to say the 27 tasks that go into being a financial advisor might automate like 10 of them [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2795.9s)]
*  But it doesn't automate the rest of them. And so what happens is a job doesn't you don't lose the job you lose the tasks [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2803.02s)]
*  You automate the task which makes you more [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2810.78s)]
*  Powerful and you spend more time on the other areas, which is human interaction and uh thinking about the future, etc [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2813.26s)]
*  And therefore the reason ai's don't take all the jobs that they're not covering the job [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2820.46s)]
*  They're covering one specific task or other even even agi only covers specific areas. It'll increase but more and more [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2824.38s)]
*  That's why the uh, you will have amplified jobs not job [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2831.6600000000003s)]
*  Radical job loss except for the areas where you're doing one thing at a time [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2836.94s)]
*  If you were in the industrial revolution of widget stamping as a human widget stamping out [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2841.1000000000004s)]
*  Things on the assembly line that job went away because it was one thing [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2845.98s)]
*  So that's my that I found was the best framing i've seen for why ai's won't take a lot of jobs [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2849.6600000000003s)]
*  So listen, I I do think that is the case today that ai's can do 80 percent but not 100 percent of a job and therefore [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2855.1800000000003s)]
*  They're freeing up people and and humans do [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2863.6600000000003s)]
*  The whole job with the support of ai's [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2867.98s)]
*  but [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2870.46s)]
*  I have [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2872.06s)]
*  100 confidence that ai's will get to a point where they can do 100 of the job [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2874.54s)]
*  and [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2880.62s)]
*  From everything i've seen what I used to think would be the holdout of humanity [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2881.82s)]
*  that interpersonal relationship the ability to be [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2888.14s)]
*  compassionate and um and you know understanding and and patient and that human connection [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2893.0s)]
*  Holy shit. I've seen ai's do a much better job on that than than humans agree [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2900.22s)]
*  agree, but I think there's i'll take you back, uh to the [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2905.9s)]
*  autonomous driving [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2911.08s)]
*  Conversation right? Okay. We had autonomous cars since the google car in 2008 and we confidently predicted that in a decade [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2912.7s)]
*  You'd have more than 20 penetration of autonomous cars. It's been slow, etc [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2920.54s)]
*  And the answer the reason is that even in an autonomous car [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2925.6600000000003s)]
*  Those little edge cases of a bicyclist overtaking another bicyclist and now you have to kind of go wider because of that or just avoiding potholes [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2929.6600000000003s)]
*  We can't do there's all these edge cases that we can't cover [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2937.1000000000004s)]
*  100 percent of because human beings are so good at adaptive [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2940.5400000000004s)]
*  uh in physical intelligence that a human a robot driver can't cover all of that and is very far away from that and therefore [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2944.7000000000003s)]
*  We're very far away from that domain. I think we're going to end up with the same [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2952.38s)]
*  Paradigm around this however to your point [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2956.3s)]
*  I think what we'll do is reframe what we mean by a job [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2958.78s)]
*  So that as can take more and more of it and therefore the human being gets squeezed over time. There's a lot. Um, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2961.98s)]
*  I really commend this paper to everybody you could listen to my podcast with imad on this subject [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2968.38s)]
*  But if you haven't yet go and and imad tweeted the whole paper on his thing [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2974.1400000000003s)]
*  So at imad if you want to go check it out. Yeah [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2978.3s)]
*  For for sure [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2981.5s)]
*  You just have to read it like four times to get your head around it, but it's but it's beautifully written [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2983.18s)]
*  It's beautifully written. All right [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2988.06s)]
*  last subject on ai before we go to [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2990.8599999999997s)]
*  other fun subjects, uh, like neuralink and and robots [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2994.06s)]
*  uh, I I added this because I think one of the conversations that's not sufficiently being discussed [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=2998.06s)]
*  Is the power requirements of ai? [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3005.98s)]
*  So today the u.s. Has is generating about uh, uh, [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3009.42s)]
*  four uh [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3015.34s)]
*  Terrawatt hours terrawatt hours per year [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3016.78s)]
*  Of energy and if you look at energy, I should have put the the chart on here. But if you look at energy [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3020.86s)]
*  Uh historically over the last 20 years and our current predicted growth in energy. It's pretty flat. The u.s. Is not [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3026.86s)]
*  adding more capacity [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3033.42s)]
*  Um at the rate that it should be [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3035.9s)]
*  Uh china on the other side of the equation has blown through the u.s [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3038.94s)]
*  It's like tripled its total capacity on its way to quadrupling its total capacity india has been increasing in doubling [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3043.42s)]
*  um, and there's a [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3050.46s)]
*  There's an estimate that by 2030 [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3053.98s)]
*  Uh ai is going to require 100 of today's u.s. Energy grid production [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3057.7400000000002s)]
*  Um ai is a very hungry beast and so we're going to need some new sources of energy [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3064.14s)]
*  and uh [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3071.3399999999997s)]
*  The reason I added this is I think you know generation for nuclear is one of the most important [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3072.62s)]
*  Technologies that's being held back by public opinion and regulation [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3079.72s)]
*  Um, I think it's super safe and so china demonstrates first entirely meltdown proof nuclear reactor [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3083.8199999999997s)]
*  um [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3091.02s)]
*  That's you know incredible. It's like why not have nuclear energy, right? We're going to have fusion eventually got it and solar is on the increase [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3092.46s)]
*  But gen 4 nuclear that is fail safe meanings when it when it's fail when it fails, it's [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3101.18s)]
*  safely contained [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3107.34s)]
*  I put this in my backyard. How about you? What are your thoughts here? [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3108.94s)]
*  um, I completely agree. I think the whole small nuclear and [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3112.2200000000003s)]
*  Um [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3116.7s)]
*  Milkproof nuclear is the future [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3117.8999999999996s)]
*  To cover the base load until we generate enough battery storage there where solar can take over and other things [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3120.7799999999997s)]
*  Um, I think what i'm trying powerful framing here is the same conversation that's happened in bitcoin where people go [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3126.7s)]
*  Oh my god bitcoin consumes the energy that portugal uses and therefore we should shut it down [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3132.9399999999996s)]
*  And what's happening is we're finding all sorts of like for example [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3138.2999999999997s)]
*  If you have a hydroelectric dam in the far north of québec it takes so long for the transmission [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3141.66s)]
*  You've lost the energy by the time you get it down you are useful therefore the data the the hydroelectric dams [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3148.3799999999997s)]
*  It's empty. However, now you can put a bitcoin facility next to it and essentially turn that energy into something useful and about six months [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3154.06s)]
*  ago, we crossed 50 percent [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3162.22s)]
*  bitcoin mining by renewables [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3164.8599999999997s)]
*  And the next marginal 50 percent will be just the next chunk will be all renewables [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3167.66s)]
*  I think the same thing happened with ai will start putting ai [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3172.78s)]
*  Data centers in the far reaches of wherever there will put [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3176.38s)]
*  Yeah, yeah a month ago. I was in kazakhstan [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3180.38s)]
*  And there's a there's a valley in the east of kazakhstan where the wind just flows and they put a gigawatt wind farm there [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3183.34s)]
*  It's so far. It's not that useful for anything but an ai data center and a bitcoin mining thing beautiful [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3190.3s)]
*  So I think the when we think about the fact that we have what? [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3196.2999999999997s)]
*  8 000 times more energy hitting the earth than we use we'll just start tapping into that to do all this empower all the other stuff [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3199.64s)]
*  So I don't worry about energy at all [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3206.22s)]
*  Well, I worry about it in the u.s [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3208.2999999999997s)]
*  If it becomes the limiting factor for the u.s being able to stay ahead in the energy and the ai race [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3210.8599999999997s)]
*  I also worry about it where if it's easier for [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3216.94s)]
*  large companies [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3221.3399999999997s)]
*  To build coal plants or natural gas plants [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3222.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, because they're not going to stop [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3225.82s)]
*  Right. This is an all-out ai war and in microsoft and google and and meta they're all going to be [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3229.5s)]
*  just buying as much energy as they possibly can [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3238.0600000000004s)]
*  and [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3241.5800000000004s)]
*  If the answer because of regulation and because of ease of paperwork is [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3242.7000000000003s)]
*  You know god forbid carbon producing [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3248.5400000000004s)]
*  Then you got a problem [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3251.6600000000003s)]
*  I think the way the root commentary you're making is the the regulators in the u.s need to take a very bold move here [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3253.66s)]
*  Wake up regulators. I think I think that's absolutely correct everybody [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3260.46s)]
*  I want to take a short break from our episode to talk about a company. That's very important to me [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3264.7799999999997s)]

*  Groups in the world that has about 10 000 financial advisors [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3473.1800000000003s)]
*  I was saying so what's your bitcoin strategy? They're like, oh, uh, we don't allow our financial advisors to talk about bitcoin to their clients at all [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3476.54s)]
*  And the financial advisors are like, are you kidding? [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3483.58s)]
*  The our clients are asking us about bitcoin and we're not allowed to answer you're killing us [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3485.9s)]
*  Um, why because the regulatory risk they have of they're worried that if somebody gives financial advice on bitcoin [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3490.62s)]
*  And it's not an approved method of any kind by whatever they face legal exposure [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3497.8199999999997s)]
*  So they've shut down that conversation again going back to mindset and regulatory similar to the nuclear conversation [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3502.7s)]
*  I think there's an underlying driver here that just makes this inexorable which is the fact that jeff booth's observation [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3509.2599999999998s)]
*  That um, he wrote a book called the price of tomorrow that you should all go read [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3516.54s)]
*  And he in the book he basically shows that over the last 50 years every dollar increase in global gdp [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3520.7s)]
*  Has come from a with a four dollar increase in global debt [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3526.54s)]
*  So we're growing the global economy with a while and you can't it's structural. You can't pay it back. You can't just write it off [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3530.46s)]
*  So that that does not end well [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3537.02s)]
*  It does not end well and look at the debt in the u.s right now. We're creating a trillion dollars of debt every hundred days or so [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3539.98s)]
*  Um, and we're now paying more interest on the u.s debt [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3545.82s)]
*  Than we then the u.s spends on its military [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3550.3s)]
*  Okay, that is a pretty ridiculous comment and it's not slowing down. There's no mechanism [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3553.1000000000004s)]
*  This is the problem with our democracies. There's no mechanism to look down the line and go. Hey, we got to stop doing this [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3558.6200000000003s)]
*  Uh, and so this is a huge issue across parties and nobody's looking at it [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3565.5s)]
*  You don't hear it mentioned in the [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3569.9s)]
*  In the in the political debates at all and this is a massive problem the escape hatch between [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3572.06s)]
*  that world and the etfs connecting to bitcoin now gives a [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3578.7000000000003s)]
*  a kind of an atomic bomb lifeline and a shelter where people can escape through that into the bitcoin world [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3583.5s)]
*  Which is why we're also optimistic about bitcoin [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3590.54s)]
*  The recent drop by the way for people that are tracking it there's a huge drop [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3593.7400000000002s)]
*  It turned out germany sold a massive chunk at the same time that mount gox [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3597.66s)]
*  Was paying back a bunch of their folks and so a huge amount of bitcoin got liquidated [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3601.9s)]
*  This is the best buying opportunity ever. I remember michael sailor's comment that you get bitcoin at the price you deserve [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3606.62s)]
*  That's really [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3614.7000000000003s)]
*  And so liam, you know, I want to give you credit here because you're on the stage [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3615.98s)]
*  I can physically just so in detail remember you [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3620.78s)]
*  At our singularity executive program [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3625.02s)]
*  2012 [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3629.64s)]
*  Thereabouts you're on stage to the to the room, you know [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3632.3s)]
*  I'd just gotten off talking about six d's or whatever and you step on you say have you heard about this thing called bitcoin? [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3635.34s)]
*  And you start talking about bitcoin. I'm going what the hell is this bitcoin? You know, we we have [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3641.98s)]
*  It's important to look back at the history here just for a second [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3648.46s)]
*  When bitcoin came out in 2009 a lot of people kind of just ignored it [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3651.98s)]
*  Even though they were deeply excited about digital currencies of why because there had been so many attempts in the past that had failed [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3656.38s)]
*  Right. Yeah, and so they everybody watched for a while myself included [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3663.9s)]
*  I've watched bitcoin go for five cents of bitcoin to 50 cents of bitcoin to five dollars of bitcoin to 50 dollars of bitcoin [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3668.46s)]
*  And how how much higher could it possibly go? [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3674.62s)]
*  Yeah, and then at five hundred dollars bitcoin, it's a hard emotional choice to make when you knew it was five cents bitcoin [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3677.18s)]
*  That's a really big thing to cross and yeah, I remember finally buying a few at that at that level [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3682.7s)]
*  um the the [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3688.7s)]
*  There are two types of people that come up to me from those days [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3691.02s)]
*  The ones that listened and bought bitcoin and they're hugely grateful and the ones are like should I wish I'd listened and bought bitcoin? [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3694.54s)]
*  It was completely binary around that. So I think there's there's [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3701.42s)]
*  This is just one of those things where you I think the way michael sailor put it was really best [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3705.7400000000002s)]
*  He said go spend a hundred hours researching bitcoin [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3710.46s)]
*  And then if you don't like it come back to me with some salient points and we'll have a conversation [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3713.9s)]
*  Yeah, so and nobody does you know, it's interesting. I look at one of my largest holdings [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3718.46s)]
*  If not the largest holding outside of real estate is is bitcoin and so when it drops from [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3724.38s)]
*  $70,000 to $50,000 [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3731.32s)]
*  You know first reaction of the amygdala in the animal brain is holy shit run and hide, right? [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3734.32s)]
*  And yeah, and there's got to be a judo move here for those who are bitcoin believers to say oh my god time to buy [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3740.6400000000003s)]
*  Right, and so sailor is there and um, you know, I think i'm there at this point, too [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3747.6s)]
*  Uh, you know, I was a great there's a great meme [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3753.52s)]
*  Of a cartoon where someone said [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3758.32s)]
*  You know dad was it true that bitcoin was below 100 000 in your day, you know [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3761.12s)]
*  That's wonderful [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3768.0s)]
*  Yeah, I actually looked forward with glee when it drops because i'm thinking oh I could buy some more [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3769.04s)]
*  I just told him when he spare cash to do that, but but I do get this burst of oh my god [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3773.7599999999998s)]
*  I wish I could buy some more [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3778.24s)]
*  so the big news here has been uh [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3780.0s)]
*  a conversation by at least two of the three presidential candidates about the idea of holding [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3783.7599999999998s)]
*  bitcoin in treasury of the united states [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3790.72s)]
*  Let alone what micro strategies is doing is putting bitcoin in treasury for its stock, which has played incredibly well [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3793.12s)]
*  Right micro strategies is you know, one of the top performing stocks in the s&p [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3801.12s)]
*  um [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3806.72s)]
*  Do you know so we've talked about this right there's six d's, you know when you digitize something [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3808.16s)]
*  Uh, it's deceptive and then disruptive it dematerializes demonetizes democratizes [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3813.6s)]
*  and [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3819.04s)]
*  uh, the phases of bitcoin it went from the early entrepreneur to you know, uh, [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3819.92s)]
*  high-end entrepreneurs [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3826.96s)]
*  uh to institutions [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3828.8s)]
*  and [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3830.8s)]
*  You know, will we see governments? So what's your prediction on when a we're seeing governments right now? [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3831.84s)]
*  but when the u.s might do this, I think I don't know about the u.s just because the [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3837.2000000000003s)]
*  The the u.s dollar is so fundamentally important to u.s hegemony around the world [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3842.8s)]
*  That making a major move in bitcoin would would have a huge impact on the dollar maybe stabilizing it [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3849.68s)]
*  uh [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3856.08s)]
*  Maybe maybe people out of confidence that I think it's one powerful way for the u.s to deal with its debt is to just [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3857.2s)]
*  Hedge it but if I was the u.s [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3863.2799999999997s)]
*  I'd do it quietly and not talk about it because that and that's what I think is happening right now [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3865.04s)]
*  I think what's happening is you you have to recognize that after [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3869.68s)]
*  micro-strategies and after el salvador took on bitcoin as its reserve currency that every [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3873.5s)]
*  Cfo in the world of a public company and every uh [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3878.48s)]
*  Sovereign wealth fund is looking at this going [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3883.2s)]
*  Ha I need to be thinking that taking down to account and for those of us that are bullish on bitcoin [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3885.84s)]
*  If one percent of the fortune [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3892.0s)]
*  1000 put one percent of their treasury into bitcoin that would make it the same price of as the price of gold [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3894.62s)]
*  Which is roughly a million dollars of bitcoin [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3900.32s)]
*  So, you know if you do the math the more the adoption takes place and note that in 15 years [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3902.48s)]
*  Now people not figure out a way of hacking bitcoin, right? [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3908.4s)]
*  Um, the satoshi wallet has 60 billion dollars worth of bitcoin and you gotta see the [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3911.6800000000003s)]
*  Think there's a lot of people trying to get into that wallet and nobody's managed it. Yeah, there's you know [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3917.04s)]
*  It's the greatest treasure hunt ever. Um [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3921.84s)]
*  I don't think it's any technology risk. Uh, and [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3925.52s)]
*  I'm you know [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3929.28s)]
*  At 99.99 percent surety, but the only question becomes is their political risk, right? [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3930.96s)]
*  I remember having a conversation with an a minister from a foreign nation having dinner with I would say who was [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3938.0s)]
*  And they're like your government really wants to shut down bitcoin [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3944.88s)]
*  I mean in terms of this current administration, right? So if gentsler and all of that [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3948.7200000000003s)]
*  I want to talk more about it. But um [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3953.6s)]
*  Uh, I can answer that very easily please it goes back to if you shut down bitcoin [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3956.3199999999997s)]
*  You know when I send you bitcoin i'm sending you a string of text and numbers [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3962.0s)]
*  How you interpret that string of text and numbers is up to you [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3965.44s)]
*  So it turns out in the u.s specifically bitcoin is protected by first amendment. There's a strong legal case around this [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3969.2799999999997s)]
*  There's a great anecdote around pgp if you know that story. Yeah [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3975.12s)]
*  Right. Should I recount that for folks? [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3979.12s)]
*  Uh up to you, I mean it's really it's really important [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3981.2799999999997s)]
*  Especially if you think of a bitcoin in the u.s [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3984.4s)]
*  So pretty good privacy was an email encryption that was invented in the in the late 90s if I remember right and [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3986.64s)]
*  the u.s [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3994.3199999999997s)]
*  Department defense desperately tried to stop the propagation of pgp into the world because then they wouldn't be able to read emails globally [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=3995.52s)]
*  Which of course they wanted to do [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4002.88s)]
*  And the pgp creators are like well everybody should have this [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4005.12s)]
*  Why should it just be restricted this so the d.o.d put a [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4008.24s)]
*  Full restriction saying ita regulations. You are absolutely forbidden to export this so they looked at this and said, huh? [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4012.08s)]
*  Okay, what do we do? [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4017.7599999999998s)]
*  So what they did was they printed the source code for pgp on a piece on the paper faxed it to the uk [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4018.56s)]
*  Which then ocr'd the code and were able to recreate bitcoin department defense took them to court [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4024.56s)]
*  And the and the court said first amendment pal. You can't stop people from extracting opinion [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4030.7999999999997s)]
*  So there's a really strong precedent on first amendment and then property rights anywhere that has property rights [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4035.3599999999997s)]
*  You cannot stop bitcoin from propagating. So there's some very compelling arguments to [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4042.0s)]
*  Especially in the u.s [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4046.64s)]
*  But globally anywhere where you have property rights of any reasonable level you won't be able to stop it [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4047.9199999999996s)]
*  Do you want to slow it down on ramps off ramps, etc? [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4053.3599999999997s)]
*  But they're not going to be able to stop it. I just did a [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4057.12s)]
*  A great another podcast with bill barhite ahead of abra [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4059.8399999999997s)]
*  Um, which again people go listen to it. It's that's you know, how where I hold my bitcoin. Where do you hold your bitcoin right now? [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4064.8799999999997s)]
*  uh, I do self [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4073.2s)]
*  Custodial on a stick and a few other metrics. Does your like do you do you pucker really hard when you pull out that stick? [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4075.2799999999997s)]
*  To go and do something with it [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4080.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, it's it's really what you do with the keywords and how do you secure those? [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4082.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, because the stick is is the thing but you know [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4087.2799999999997s)]
*  This is a great thing about capitalism right safe custodial models like abra will appear [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4090.9599999999996s)]
*  And people move to a swan is another one that's really good at this [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4096.16s)]
*  So there'll be a whole bunch of there's so much economic incentive for helping people with that problem [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4099.44s)]
*  The equivalent of a digital bank safety deposit box is a really powerful one [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4104.48s)]
*  Do you want to give your non-financial advice that you gave at x-prize here? [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4109.36s)]
*  Which was oh [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4114.8s)]
*  Non-financial advice would be take 10 of your of your net worth [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4116.8s)]
*  At the minimum and put it into bitcoin and close your eyes for 10 years if you can [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4121.84s)]
*  Is it true that you? [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4126.88s)]
*  Pulled out a mortgage on your house and bought bitcoin [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4128.64s)]
*  Well, we sold the house. Yeah, and my condition with lily to selling the house [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4132.8s)]
*  So I wanted to be able to put a big chunk of that into bitcoin [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4136.88s)]
*  so [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4140.08s)]
*  Bitcoin is almost about the equivalent of my real estate holdings. Yeah [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4141.4400000000005s)]
*  All right, i'm excited for us to keep this conversation in future months. Let's talk about neuralink news [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4147.04s)]
*  um [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4153.4400000000005s)]
*  Elon has his second implant [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4154.4800000000005s)]
*  And it talks about human ai comps and this is one of the conversations that took place a little bit at [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4157.2s)]
*  abundance the past year [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4163.68s)]
*  Is about the idea that if ai and humans are going to link up [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4165.6s)]
*  Or will ai take off without humans? Let's listen to uh to elon for a moment the long-term [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4171.6s)]
*  aspiration of neuralink is to [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4179.34s)]
*  improve the ai [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4182.08s)]
*  human symbiosis [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4184.16s)]
*  by increasing the [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4186.4800000000005s)]
*  the bandwidth of the communication [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4188.56s)]
*  Because if even if in the most benign scenario of ai [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4191.28s)]
*  You have to consider [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4195.92s)]
*  That the ai is simply going to get bored waiting for you to spit out a few words [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4197.92s)]
*  I mean if the ai can communicate at terabits per second and you're communicating at [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4203.28s)]
*  You know bits per second [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4208.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's like talking to a tree [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4210.56s)]
*  Okay [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4212.24s)]
*  So first of all if we can communicate at you know at kilobits per second or megabits per second and it's [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4212.8s)]
*  Communicating at terabits per second and still going to get bored [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4219.58s)]
*  um, do you remember the movie her I just rewatched it and there's a point at which the [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4222.72s)]
*  the star of the movie is talking to uh [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4228.88s)]
*  to his ai [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4231.4400000000005s)]
*  and he [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4233.12s)]
*  finally gets the idea that it's not a [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4234.64s)]
*  Monogamous relationship and he goes how many people are you talking to you right now? [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4237.66s)]
*  and she goes um [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4242.64s)]
*  8736 or something like that and I find that fascinating [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4245.66s)]
*  Well, this is the whole bandwidth issue, right? [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4250.24s)]
*  I think that movie if you haven't watched the movie her h er, please don't go to go watch it [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4252.24s)]
*  It's probably the best framing we've seen on [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4257.28s)]
*  the realistic outcome of ai [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4260.4s)]
*  Because hollywood tends to always portray it as the matrix the terminator [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4263.2s)]
*  uh the the the whatever and the robot overlords trick over the world and if you're [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4267.2s)]
*  Lucky your pets and if we're unlucky we're food it always goes that way [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4272.719999999999s)]
*  And but the reality is much more likely that an ai evolves so quickly past us. They look at us as ants [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4276.96s)]
*  And go, you know your little one-liter brain in your head [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4282.88s)]
*  Uh vitalic accepted is not just not interesting enough to to talk to [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4285.839999999999s)]
*  I'm talking to millions of ai's in parallel and it takes off it goes have a nice life. It just [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4291.36s)]
*  Has life thanks for all the fish [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4296.32s)]
*  Thanks for all the fish and I think that's the most likely outcome which i'm kind of okay with you know, if that's the progression of life [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4298.48s)]
*  Uh, that's kind of okay [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4306.0s)]
*  but I think what elon is doing around this is really really important and the [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4307.679999999999s)]
*  The next conversation around bandwidth is critical [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4312.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean right now we communicate, uh when you and I are speaking [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4316.24s)]
*  What what is it bits per uh per second? Is it is it bits per second bps? [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4321.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah, no, no, no, but it's like oh, it's like in the single digits. I mean four bits per second [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4326.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's not a lot and and you think about the megabits and gigabits that we have on our networks. There's no comparison. Yeah, so [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4331.12s)]
*  Here we go [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4339.92s)]
*  Think about this you're typing on a keyboard, right? [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4341.68s)]
*  I mean, it's literally that's about as fast as we can do it. There's not a lot of bits per second [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4344.72s)]
*  um [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4350.240000000001s)]
*  And it's shockingly slow [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4351.6s)]
*  Let's hear elon about making it faster. It's going to be [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4355.360000000001s)]
*  gigantic, um [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4360.240000000001s)]
*  Because we'll increase the number of electrodes dramatically [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4362.400000000001s)]
*  We'll improve the signal processing [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4366.96s)]
*  So [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4369.52s)]
*  you know we with with [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4370.4800000000005s)]
*  Even with only roughly I don't 10 15 percent of the electrodes working with uh with noland with our first patient [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4372.56s)]
*  We were able to get to achieve [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4379.28s)]
*  a bits per second [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4381.6s)]
*  That's twice the world record [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4383.68s)]
*  So I think we'll we'll start like vastly exceeding the world record by orders of magnitude in the years to come [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4386.0s)]
*  So it's like getting to I don't know a hundred bits per second thousand [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4391.92s)]
*  you know, maybe [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4395.2s)]
*  Maybe if you're like five years from now, we might be at a megabit [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4397.679999999999s)]
*  Like faster than any human could possibly communicate [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4401.36s)]
*  Uh by typing or speaking [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4404.16s)]
*  Um, obviously if we I find that compelling right? I mean I want as much [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4407.5199999999995s)]
*  as possible [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4413.84s)]
*  So let me ask you the question here selim. Um, they open up neural links to the general public [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4416.08s)]
*  uh [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4422.72s)]
*  Are you are you like get me one baby as soon as possible? No [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4424.0s)]
*  You're not no, i'll tell you why [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4429.36s)]
*  So I go back to the so i'll tell you why i'm incredibly excited about this and i'm why i'm like, okay [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4432.24s)]
*  Okay, come on. Let's I mean you don't have to even shave your head. They could just go straight in [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4437.68s)]
*  The the usb port on the side of the head is you know, that's that kind of old dream [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4444.0s)]
*  I think the the the reason that it requires physical intervention is a tough one because our [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4448.0s)]
*  Evolve much faster than any implant would evolve if you put it in right? [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4454.4s)]
*  So there's that uh, you'd have to have this like deep thing going into your brain [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4458.24s)]
*  Which is fine once it gets to I just don't want to be the first test subject [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4461.6s)]
*  In that in that model, but I didn't say test subject. I said it's you know, the fda's approved it [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4465.2s)]
*  It's commercially available now are you gonna get one? I I would wait a little i'm always weirdly [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4469.52s)]
*  I'm a late adopter in new hack new technologies. I'm always two two phones behind everybody else just because i'm [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4474.96s)]
*  I use it so materially that I can't afford to be at the bleeding edge and have some stuff [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4481.839999999999s)]
*  Work or lose things etc [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4486.96s)]
*  So that's just me personally but the I think why i'm excited and why i'm on this [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4488.639999999999s)]
*  I'm incredibly excited at the general conversation of increasing output of the human brain [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4494.88s)]
*  That's a really powerful framing and I think it's I love the first principle [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4500.0s)]
*  Thinking that elon brings to the table on any of these conversations that brings everybody's thinking up to that level [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4504.719999999999s)]
*  And then you have to think in that way and it's the fact that he's [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4511.839999999999s)]
*  Without realizing it coaching tens of millions of entrepreneurs around the world to think in this way because he does is incredibly exciting for the future [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4515.36s)]
*  Here's where I get a little bit more if you think about it [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4523.44s)]
*  He kind of makes this comment in this clip that we put out x amount of [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4526.16s)]
*  Roughly a bit per per second is our output if you average it across the day [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4530.24s)]
*  But you know [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4535.04s)]
*  We just talked about why in person is so important because when you're in person face to face with somebody [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4535.759999999999s)]
*  There's a ton more happening than just my communication patterns back and forth. There's the pheromones we're putting out [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4541.5199999999995s)]
*  There's our body language. There's visual cues. There's all sorts of verbal tonality that goes along [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4548.16s)]
*  There's a ton of bandwidth occurring between two people [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4553.839999999999s)]
*  On the conversation much much more than just the pure bits per second being output [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4557.839999999999s)]
*  But you know, you know as well as I do that all of that [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4561.839999999999s)]
*  Information is being converted to neuronal signals [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4566.62s)]
*  It is and your brain is only able to process a small number [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4570.88s)]
*  So as we're having this conversation, you know, there's traffic noise going on outside [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4574.719999999999s)]
*  There's air conditioning comes on and we don't notice that because i'm focused on the wisdom that selena miss mael is is [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4579.759999999999s)]
*  Speaking to me about right now [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4587.04s)]
*  Yes, and so there's no there's no reason why? [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4588.719999999999s)]
*  In fact an ai can't actually pay attention to all of it agree do pre do pre-processing [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4591.92s)]
*  And share with me the most important information because i'm ignoring [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4599.7s)]
*  99.9 percent of the information coming to me right now [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4604.799999999999s)]
*  And yes, I have an attention focus on what I think is important and it may not actually be important [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4608.66s)]
*  Or there may be other important information that i'm missing [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4617.54s)]
*  My my point is that we have all sorts of mechanisms to do that for us in many cases [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4620.5s)]
*  So i'll give you a small example [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4624.82s)]
*  You and I both follow a few thousand people on twitter or x and then those folks we found [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4627.62s)]
*  Curate the information out on the web and news stories and breaking tech news in a powerful way and that's it [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4635.299999999999s)]
*  It's that's the pre-processing it filters it down for us, right? [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4641.86s)]
*  So we do a pretty good job of that an ai would do an incrementally better job, but not a game-changing better job at that [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4644.74s)]
*  Um if i'm sitting in front of a person all the signals that I get are [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4652.0199999999995s)]
*  Are useful about the world but it's not you know [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4656.42s)]
*  The the fact that an ai might be able to look at the signals of 10 000 people in a room [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4659.46s)]
*  In a big conference and get some sense of that [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4664.42s)]
*  But it's not probably going to affect my decision making on a moment by moment basis, right? [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4668.26s)]
*  Where I think I let me flip it around and tell you why i'm excited [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4672.82s)]
*  If you can increase the bandwidth levels and then have brains interfacing more powerfully [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4676.18s)]
*  The potential I think it'll reshape our brains unbelievably powerfully is a mechanism for [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4681.0599999999995s)]
*  We need a uh, if I had to wave a wand and fix a human being [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4688.1s)]
*  Human beings globally as a species. I would basically find a way of cutting out the amygdala, right? [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4692.74s)]
*  You talk about this [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4697.7s)]
*  It's it's constantly scanning for bad news and danger and it takes over the rest of the brain and floods it with cortisol [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4698.74s)]
*  Every time it perceives that it's a completely useless device for today's world because the amount of time we're in [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4704.26s)]
*  actual physical danger is [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4709.78s)]
*  Seconds out of a year. Yeah, and so let me give you let me give you a broader view of that [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4711.62s)]
*  Potential to that if we have the ability to to to interact with high bandwidth [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4716.02s)]
*  We could actually then emphasize the neocortex and and of of more [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4721.14s)]
*  processing power at a rational level and diminish the impact of the of the [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4726.4800000000005s)]
*  the [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4732.26s)]
*  The amygdala on us so end of rant so I agree with you [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4733.06s)]
*  And we can go broad on that right the amygdala is just your negativity bias where you pay more attention [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4737.3s)]
*  10 times more attention negative news and positive news [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4742.26s)]
*  But we have all these other cognitive biases, right? There's a familiarity bias. There is a recency bias all of these things [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4744.98s)]
*  It's like we suffer from positivity bias. We do we do though. I think that's unbiased, but that's a different story [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4751.3s)]
*  But I imagine you're having ai that's able to uh to tell you listen [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4758.42s)]
*  That's not actually true [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4764.66s)]
*  You have this piece of information from six months ago, which countervails that and let me bring that forward [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4767.06s)]
*  So in other words, uh, you know human bias alert [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4773.38s)]
*  And we can call it bullshit alert, but human bias alert [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4777.62s)]
*  I think ai could play an incredibly good role because the reason we have cognitive biases [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4780.1s)]
*  Is because the human brain cannot process all the information being thrown at it. So we we take these shortcuts [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4785.54s)]
*  Yeah [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4793.54s)]
*  okay, so [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4794.42s)]
*  A visual is coming to me. Okay. Okay, imagine I have a [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4796.1s)]
*  Headset display [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4800.1s)]
*  And i'm walking around the world doing whatever and i'm buying a [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4801.700000000001s)]
*  Bar of chocolate and an ai is scanning my brain and possibly bringing out these are the biases you're operating under right now [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4807.3s)]
*  They're the cognitive biases that are forcing and just having that feedback loop of knowing what biases are at play at any given point [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4813.9400000000005s)]
*  Would be incredibly powerful and give me a feedback loop [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4820.26s)]
*  Because this is where I think things become really exciting is the recursive feedback loop when you know what you're thinking why you're thinking something [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4823.94s)]
*  That allows you then to reshape how you're thinking. This is the whole basis behind but we're limited [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4831.38s)]
*  And and but we're so limited right now by this, you know, you know, two and a half kilogram, you know unit above [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4836.18s)]
*  14 watts of power [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4843.44s)]
*  I just I just can't wait to uh to plug in and expand beyond that but you know, that's me [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4845.22s)]
*  I'm going to throw one more little thing in this. Okay [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4850.34s)]
*  Okay [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4853.139999999999s)]
*  You know just you know, i've done a lot of mindfulness meditation right vipashna where you sit and you just be aware of what's happening [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4854.099999999999s)]
*  Your body just imagine that I could be fully aware of all the activity in every cell in my hands [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4860.0199999999995s)]
*  Right now and I could be fully cognizant the excitement and energy around every cell in your body [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4867.3s)]
*  Which has its own mainly mini sub universes 40 trillion cells a billion chemical reactions per second [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4873.22s)]
*  Just that is a profound thought in terms of could I just contemplate that more? [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4878.98s)]
*  Profoundly forget interfaces elsewhere, etc, etc. So there's unbelievable without psychedelic drugs [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4884.48s)]
*  They give us a shortcut to what's possible and I think there's the the ability to contemplate a broader with broader bandwidth [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4892.74s)]
*  The unbelievable reality we live in is amazing [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4900.419999999999s)]
*  All right. Let's go to elon again on uh on [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4904.66s)]
*  Patients outperforming gamers. We feel pretty confident that um [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4907.860000000001s)]
*  I think maybe within the next year or two that someone with a neural link implant will be able to outperform [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4912.820000000001s)]
*  A pro gamer [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4920.5s)]
*  Nice [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4922.900000000001s)]
*  Because the reaction time would be faster, you know, uh, what's fascinating. I remember when I did a [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4923.860000000001s)]
*  uh [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4929.9400000000005s)]
*  A long-form conversation with elon after we announced the hundred million dollar [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4930.820000000001s)]
*  Uh must carbon prize [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4934.98s)]
*  I was asking him about the first neural link patient, which was a chimp [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4938.099999999999s)]
*  um [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4942.98s)]
*  Mechak, uh, you know, it was chimpanzee [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4943.94s)]
*  Called pager and it was playing pong and I said did you play against pager and he said yes and I said who won? [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4946.58s)]
*  uh, and uh [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4954.42s)]
*  I think pager won but I think elon may have said he did I don't know well [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4956.74s)]
*  But it's fascinating [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4961.299999999999s)]
*  That we're going to get there, you know, the olympics are looking at esports as an olympic game [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4964.26s)]
*  um [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4970.900000000001s)]
*  And we're going to you know, question is will you be able to be enhanced when you're playing those games? [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4972.26s)]
*  That will be that'll be fascinating [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4978.66s)]
*  I mean, this is a long trend right which I think you know [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4980.820000000001s)]
*  We have really good evidence today that the best leadership skills in the world are taught if you play world of warcraft [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4984.66s)]
*  So do you let your son play world of warcraft? [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4991.0599999999995s)]
*  Not yet because he's I think he's too young and he probably plays that stuff with her [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4994.98s)]
*  He plays half of that stuff without telling me anyway [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=4998.58s)]
*  um the but I think the opportunity to really develop a [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5001.379999999999s)]
*  Powerful skill deep human skills using this capability is massive [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5006.16s)]
*  I think you know when you talk about ai's beating, uh the pro gamers, etc. That's great, but we've seen that in chess [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5010.9s)]
*  Right and we know the outcome what happens it just changes the game a little bit difference here is, you know [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5018.820000000001s)]
*  Again directly from from the neocortex and and these are a lot of these are twitch games [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5024.9800000000005s)]
*  A lot of these are reaction time games, right? And so when the reaction time is minimized [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5029.54s)]
*  Um because you're going straight, you know input output. I mean it's [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5034.42s)]
*  You know, I I don't know is that cheating? [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5040.34s)]
*  Um, if this to some extent it's just doing things better and differently [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5043.78s)]
*  Gamers spend a ton of money buying a like a mouse that is connected directly into the motherboard [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5047.46s)]
*  So they they have that few microseconds advantage [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5052.66s)]
*  Uh for me, it's eh for a lot of this [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5057.299999999999s)]
*  But the the general concept of interacting with the the brain and having a broader bandwidth to process do signal processing is incredible [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5060.34s)]
*  Here's our last slide here and I think this is the numbers folks take away [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5068.74s)]
*  Uh, so prior to neurolink the world record for a human [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5072.66s)]
*  Using a device is somewhere around 4.2 to 4.6 bits per second [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5076.58s)]
*  Um noland is at 8.5 and we heard elon in the previous video talk about going to megabit, you know when I think about [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5081.86s)]
*  The notion that there's nothing more important [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5090.5s)]
*  Um for a company or for a nation than its cumulative intelligence [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5094.1s)]
*  Um, right the ability of a company to perform its mission [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5101.54s)]
*  Um is a function of you know per capita intelligence, I think [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5108.42s)]
*  Uh, maybe you disagree with that. I disagree with that. Okay, tell me where you come from [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5114.18s)]
*  I'm gonna bring out my exo bias here a huge amount has to do with how it's organized, right? [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5118.82s)]
*  Yeah, if you have all of the most powerful let's assume they're organized identical, but one group is more intelligent than the other [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5125.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, of course that's gonna do better. But but the organization always beats bandwidth [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5132.98s)]
*  And brain power, but okay, but both we've given a choice to take both here [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5139.62s)]
*  You can't you can do both but I think there's so much [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5144.42s)]
*  Mileage to be gained by just organizing better and not being top down [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5148.26s)]
*  Command controlled slow decision making that's what limits intelligence the for example [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5152.74s)]
*  The basic intelligence in any institution take the nuclear energy discussion we were having earlier [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5158.02s)]
*  The that limitation is not a function of intelligence [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5163.7s)]

*  And operating from a different model in a different framework. Yeah, it's the changing of models. That's hard [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5172.34s)]
*  Yeah, but we just made my point right which is right, you know [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5176.900000000001s)]
*  intelligence and regulators different [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5180.4800000000005s)]

*  That they spent billions on biodefense weapons the ability to accurately detect viruses and microbes [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5200.26s)]
*  By reading their rna. Well a company called viome exclusively licensed the technology from los alamos labs [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5207.46s)]
*  To build a platform that can measure your microbiome and the rna in your blood now [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5214.26s)]
*  Viome has a product that i've personally used for years called full body intelligence [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5219.94s)]
*  Which collects a few drops of your blood spit in stool and can tell you so much about your health [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5224.42s)]

*  Let's talk about robotic news next so we could jump into that. All right, let's go to the robot. All right, so [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5293.88s)]
*  So we're seeing a lot [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5299.32s)]
*  in the world [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5301.5599999999995s)]
*  Uh, if I think about the robotics right now we talked about this again at the at the abundance summit [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5303.32s)]
*  They're like 30 well-funded [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5309.16s)]
*  Humanoid robot companies on the planet [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5311.86s)]
*  optimist and figure are [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5315.8s)]
*  You know tesla [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5318.12s)]
*  There are robots called optimist and figure brett adcock's company [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5319.88s)]
*  Disrelease figure two. We'll talk about that in a minute [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5324.599999999999s)]
*  Are the top two in the u.s and there's a whole bunch in china because china needs [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5327.5599999999995s)]
*  robots [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5332.92s)]
*  Let's listen to a quick note from from elon on the numbers the size of the market and then we'll talk about [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5334.36s)]
*  This in more detail the optimist numbers like they're really just they're like so mind-blowing that you're like is this is this real? [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5340.92s)]
*  but [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5348.679999999999s)]
*  Because I I actually think the market for humanoid robots is in excess of 10 billion [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5349.72s)]
*  Units like more more than the number of humans [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5355.639999999999s)]
*  Because people will each want one and then there'll be others that are involved in industry and stuff [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5359.0s)]
*  So if they do sell for 20 000, that's 200 trillion dollars [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5364.44s)]
*  This is just a insane insane number. That's why I like I wonder what does money even mean at that point, you know [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5370.76s)]
*  No, what does money even mean at that point? So so uh selim? [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5375.32s)]
*  The numbers here to reflect on [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5382.28s)]
*  And I I got these exact same numbers from brett adcock when I did a podcast with him recently [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5386.28s)]
*  Uh 20 000 a unit that's what the price sort of converges on [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5392.599999999999s)]
*  And uh, that's like 100 a month if you're gonna lease it [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5397.400000000001s)]
*  and uh, you know 10 billion of them in the world well [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5401.32s)]
*  I think I again have I like going to the extremes and just considering both sides of this [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5405.32s)]
*  I think at one level. It's incredibly exciting the best framing and [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5411.16s)]
*  metaphor of [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5417.16s)]
*  robots comes from the ai conversation with emad where he goes when you have a bunch if you're the head chef and you have [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5418.92s)]
*  A bunch of sous chefs organizing everything for you. You become way more creative [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5424.84s)]
*  You execute way faster because I can right now if I had an a sous chef ai in the kitchen [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5429.08s)]
*  And I want to make a really complicated indian recipe [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5434.84s)]
*  I like I spend a huge amount of time gathering all the freaking ingredients [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5439.08s)]
*  Just that would be a huge game changer in terms of my ability to be a great chef, right? [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5442.360000000001s)]
*  So I think this is where robots are able to do amazing things [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5447.88s)]
*  over time [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5452.68s)]
*  But I think the entire economics numbers become irrelevant just because the change in productivity is such a game changer [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5455.320000000001s)]
*  None of our numbers in terms of gdp or something can match what's economics economics are so broken, right? I mean [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5462.12s)]
*  gdp [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5468.52s)]
*  uh is a function of [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5469.88s)]
*  the number of [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5472.360000000001s)]
*  people working and the amount of technology and the amount of energy they have access to and all those things [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5474.04s)]
*  And all those things are you know, infinitely worse than it's worse than [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5480.200000000001s)]
*  It's it's actually a terrible because it doesn't take account deflation [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5484.28s)]
*  So if I we spend half a million dollars per breast cancer patient in the us on average, right? [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5487.72s)]
*  If you have the ability to detect breast cancer early and save all those lives gdp actually goes down [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5493.24s)]
*  So that's not a great gdp is a terrible metramp for success of the human race in the future [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5500.28s)]
*  It's just the best one we've come up with that's easily measurable [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5505.24s)]
*  For the future. So this is an important point where technology becomes deflationary [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5509.0s)]
*  And we have to navigate that for the future. But that's again a whole other conversation [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5513.88s)]
*  I'm going to play this in the background as we're talking about this is uh figure two from uh from a company called figure ai [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5517.72s)]
*  uh, and [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5525.4800000000005s)]
*  You know, I went and visited his plant and uh, and on our podcast with brett. He shows us a little bit inside [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5526.76s)]
*  And it's it's a beautiful uh robot. I actually saw [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5534.28s)]
*  Designs for figure three as well, which take this yet to another level of beauty [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5538.52s)]
*  And I don't know I I think that we're going to see these every place [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5546.76s)]
*  And and so, you know, we've had the argument about you said why do they have to look like humans [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5553.88s)]
*  I think [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5558.68s)]
*  They're going to look like humans [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5559.96s)]
*  Because that's the world we live in [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5562.28s)]
*  And they are multi-purpose and you know, what was my conversation with brett who you know, he just raised like 700 million dollars [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5564.759999999999s)]
*  From open ai and microsoft and nvidia and jeff bezos and [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5573.8s)]
*  Incredibly [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5579.62s)]
*  You know what makes this possible is the multimodal ai where you're going to just talk to robots and tell them to go do [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5580.84s)]
*  things for you [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5587.96s)]
*  And he made a point let me make one other thing he made a point that I think is really important and I would love your reflection of this [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5590.52s)]
*  The point that brett made was listen as we head towards agi or digital superintelligence [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5598.28s)]
*  We need robots. Otherwise [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5605.08s)]
*  These ai's are going to be asking us to do their bidding [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5608.04s)]
*  And that's going to be a pretty pretty depressing future [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5611.4800000000005s)]
*  Uh, okay, so very valid point I still sit on the [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5614.76s)]
*  Cautious and pessimistic side on this going back to the autonomous driving mode [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5621.48s)]
*  I'll give you one other triangulation on that which is the rumba vacuum cleaner robot [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5626.44s)]
*  Um people we you know, everybody are really excited about those and they're terrible because you have to move everything for you [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5631.48s)]
*  For the robot and now you're doing the work of the robot, which is exactly the point that you just made right? [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5637.96s)]
*  Everything you do is servicing so the robot can do and you spend more time [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5642.6s)]
*  Rearranging the room so the robot can do its thing than if you just vacuum the place in the first place [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5646.66s)]
*  But these humanoid robots will will [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5651.16s)]
*  Yeah [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5653.96s)]
*  Grab the vacuum cleaner [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5654.76s)]
*  But I think that that those small nuances will take a lot longer to to to work in there than we think [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5655.72s)]
*  We're going to get really excited about this by the way is the hive mind capability that these robots [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5661.72s)]
*  That I think will be very exciting [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5668.12s)]
*  Yeah, i'm gonna skip the nvidia [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5669.88s)]
*  Robot slide other than to say, you know every company out there is [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5672.92s)]
*  in some way shape or form [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5677.96s)]
*  Looking at working with with robotics open ai's got other projects. Google's got its projects [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5680.28s)]
*  And we're gonna see robots [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5686.68s)]
*  You know, I just tweeted [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5689.16s)]
*  um [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5692.28s)]
*  that [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5693.24s)]
*  Damn it. I posted I tweeted I posted [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5694.6s)]
*  Um [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5697.32s)]
*  Give me a damn verb belon, please. I I posted that uh, ces this year [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5698.4400000000005s)]
*  Uh, we're gonna see a ton of robots, but everything is going to be talking to you [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5704.4400000000005s)]
*  Right. Everything is going to be generative ai enabled. It can see you talk to you and that's going to be just you know, sort of [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5709.16s)]
*  Improvement de jour at ces this year. I think it would be [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5716.52s)]
*  hugely amazing [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5720.9s)]
*  If there's not often I kind of feel tempted to go to the chaos and jungle that is ces [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5723.0599999999995s)]
*  But this might be a year to go. Yeah [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5727.46s)]
*  All right. We'll go to our last subject here, which is biotech and other cool stuff [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5729.94s)]
*  uh, this was a [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5736.179999999999s)]
*  Article that came out. Um, and uh, there's a particular, uh, [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5739.219999999999s)]
*  Genetic variation that was found [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5744.66s)]
*  that increased lifespan in mice, um [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5747.94s)]
*  and [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5751.0599999999995s)]
*  By 25 percent and uh, I think what makes this interesting is it's actually [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5752.34s)]
*  In human trials as well [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5757.38s)]
*  I think what I want to point out by this slide is that we're we're continuing to find things [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5759.9400000000005s)]
*  That are extending human lifespan or contain extending, uh mammalian lifespan [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5766.42s)]
*  And that uh, we're just at the beginning of this journey [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5772.74s)]
*  It's still early games here [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5776.74s)]
*  How long do you want to live? [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5780.18s)]
*  How long do you want to live? [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5782.34s)]
*  uh, you know, i'm I [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5783.9400000000005s)]
*  uh [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5786.26s)]
*  There's a big metaphysical conversation that we don't want to get into here about [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5788.02s)]
*  Living forever, etc, etc [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5792.82s)]
*  I I think the best framing is uh having a great health span which you talk about a lot, right? [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5795.3s)]
*  Is that's a really important one because having a [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5801.3s)]
*  A vibrant life as opposed to just a long life is really really a key success factor [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5804.18s)]
*  Um, I think the world is so goddamn amazing [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5810.099999999999s)]
*  I would like to be around for a while long enough to see this massive transition that we're going through [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5813.14s)]
*  which [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5818.34s)]
*  Uh, you know, I I say this often [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5819.22s)]
*  I think the next 30 years is going to drive the next several centuries of human humanity [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5821.14s)]
*  Oh, I think it's and how do we navigate the mad max versus star trek futures that we have? [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5825.86s)]
*  Is going to be really really? [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5831.0599999999995s)]
*  Interesting and critical and it's just we you know [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5833.14s)]
*  Goes back to your comment about we must be in a simulation because it's too just too goddamn interesting [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5835.94s)]
*  Today to be around I mean we're at the 99th level of the game. I mean to look at it that way, right? [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5840.82s)]
*  it's like it would the [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5845.94s)]
*  The we are about to evolve into something [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5848.419999999999s)]
*  New it's like that line from 2001 to space odyssey, which I can't remember but uh, but it's like, you know [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5851.86s)]
*  The future is just [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5859.78s)]
*  Unbelievably awe-inspiring it's the singularity by the way, can I ask you a cool question? [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5863.06s)]
*  I know ray keeps on holding to the singularity date of like 2045 [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5867.14s)]
*  I mean that seems like like really if we've got like digital super intelligence by 2030 [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5871.9400000000005s)]
*  Don't you think it's going to move a little faster than 2045? [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5878.1s)]
*  You know, what's up with that? I'm right now plowing through the singularity is nearer. Yeah, I just finished it [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5881.46s)]
*  Um, and what i'm struck by as far as i've gotten into it is [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5887.62s)]
*  A the unbelievable prescience of his commentary from 20 30 40 50 years ago. It just blows your mind [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5892.58s)]
*  Who is this man? I mean he can't be human to be making these kinds of comments [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5899.780000000001s)]
*  That's one observation [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5905.06s)]
*  the second observation is I notice he [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5907.22s)]
*  Changes what the singularity is to talk about more as a metaphor [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5910.34s)]
*  Than [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5914.42s)]
*  A real thing which I think is the right way of framing it [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5915.54s)]
*  It's a great metaphor for the fact that we just can't predict past a certain event horizon [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5918.099999999999s)]
*  And let's just live with the fact that we can't predict it. But we have but in that in that case we have we have serial singularities [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5922.82s)]
*  Oh, I was we always talked about this at singularity university where there's there's non-stop small s's happening all the time [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5929.86s)]
*  The iphone arriving was a singularity, right? [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5937.46s)]
*  Bitcoin is singular in the words that you couldn't you can call it you couldn't predict uber when I started impacts [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5940.34s)]
*  I call it gutenberg moments. There's black swans. There's just an increasing frequency of those happening [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5945.94s)]
*  At an at a ridiculous level that's going to just change everything we do and how we do it [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5952.74s)]
*  um [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5958.82s)]
*  Going forward and the ability to absorb that and then act on it and then make sense of it is the biggest [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5959.78s)]
*  Intelligence quotient we're going to need we're going to have to have over the next decade and two. Yep [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5966.26s)]
*  agreed, but I mean [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5972.5s)]
*  I think of a ai singularity [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5975.9400000000005s)]
*  Coming where I can't predict [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5980.1s)]
*  What's coming after? [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5982.9800000000005s)]
*  I think that's already there in my open exo world [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5984.660000000001s)]
*  We have a sub community of about 600 folks focused just on ai [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5987.620000000001s)]
*  And they meet weekly just to try and process what happened this week in ai [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5991.860000000001s)]
*  And and try and make sense of it [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5996.9800000000005s)]
*  I mean, it's just it's the I would say that we've hit the singularity already in ai [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=5998.9800000000005s)]
*  The pace of change is faster than we can even talk about it or recognize it and make sense of it [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6003.38s)]
*  Yeah, I I get it. All right, let's go on [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6010.9800000000005s)]
*  I think one of our last slides here [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6016.5s)]
*  Life bio is a company that david sinclair had started and you know david made history when he showed that [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6018.82s)]
*  Epigenetic reprogramming using three out of the four yamanaka factors was able to [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6027.52s)]
*  bring back [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6033.86s)]
*  the [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6036.02s)]
*  Earlier state of youth of cells in particular. It was in the optic nerve [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6037.7s)]
*  This is uh, uh, dr. Sharon i'm not gonna [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6044.5s)]
*  Rosenwieg libson who's the chief science officer for life bio at [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6048.34s)]
*  For david's company. It's quick. Take a quick listen here. What we're doing is we're building on the work of dr [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6054.66s)]
*  David sinclair [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6059.38s)]
*  Where he identified that you only need three of the yamanaka factors off four sucks two and k lf four [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6060.66s)]
*  Which allows you to not take us all the way back to a stem cell state but rather to make a more youthful version of itself [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6066.9s)]
*  So we do it in a in our version of it is an er 100 so er 100 is a two vector system [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6074.900000000001s)]
*  Okay, so we have two vectors and it allows us to use a teton dox inducible system [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6083.22s)]
*  Short at short form it means we can control it [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6089.620000000001s)]
*  Hoping to be in the clinic in 2025. So the point here which is pretty amazing is that [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6092.820000000001s)]
*  In the clinic means for humans [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6101.3s)]
*  And we're using epigenetic, you know age reversal in humans in particular. I think they're going to be doing it for [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6103.9400000000005s)]
*  for a number of [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6112.18s)]
*  Eye related diseases and blindness reversal, but they're in [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6114.18s)]
*  primates right now and it's working [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6118.66s)]
*  And I just want people to get excited about the future in terms of [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6121.7s)]
*  You know age slowing stopping perhaps reversing aging [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6126.42s)]
*  And God knows in a lot of implications [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6130.5s)]
*  I've the broader implications, you know, what do we do with pension plans and unemployment benefits? [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6133.46s)]
*  You know all that stuff is is is kind of struck the structural changes just coming from life extension or or [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6138.5s)]
*  Unbelievable, but i'm really really excited about this [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6145.46s)]
*  I I know you spend a huge amount of your time now on the longevity stuff and you're kind of doing an unbelievable job of popularizing it [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6149.46s)]
*  And getting people used to the conversation [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6156.66s)]
*  Right. I think that's the hard the key part. This is you want to talk about singularities [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6159.22s)]
*  Breaking through the aging stuff is something that we've not really been able to do as a human species in any really meaningful way [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6164.34s)]
*  For our entire four billion year history of earth and now all of a sudden we're hitting this point where we can completely change the game [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6171.06s)]
*  Of biology. It's amazing. Yeah. All right last subject here for today life on mars. So [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6178.42s)]
*  We saw some data come back from nasa's [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6185.3s)]
*  Perseverance rover, which is you know cruising around getting data what it did was it found a particular rock? [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6188.9800000000005s)]
*  That in that rock [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6196.5s)]
*  Were three elements that were critical first it found water in the rock [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6198.900000000001s)]
*  second it found [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6203.78s)]
*  Organic compounds that were part of life and precursors and then it found evidence for [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6206.18s)]
*  Chemical energy sources in the rock and when you have those three things together [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6211.94s)]
*  Typically that spells life. I just saw this morning an article that [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6216.82s)]
*  That they also found liquid water on the surface of mars [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6221.299999999999s)]
*  So, you know, i'm excited about two three things number one the notion that I think there is life on mars today [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6225.139999999999s)]
*  It's microbial. It's subsurface [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6234.0199999999995s)]
*  It's in the past [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6236.9s)]
*  Microbial it's subsurface. It's in the permafrost in the water [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6238.9s)]
*  and just [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6244.66s)]
*  Finding life on another planet just changes [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6246.82s)]
*  Everything the second thing is going to be good [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6251.36s)]
*  I say the second thing is going to be interesting is there is a theory that because mars cooled first because it's farther from the sun [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6254.5s)]
*  Uh that life evolved on mars first and there's an exchange of material between mars and earth as asteroids [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6261.299999999999s)]
*  strike the martian surface the ejecta reaches escape velocity and so [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6269.379999999999s)]
*  It's going to be interesting if we find life on mars and compare it to life on earth [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6274.42s)]
*  Did it originate on mars first? [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6280.099999999999s)]
*  Um, and then there's the whole panspermium model, which is life, you know evolved elsewhere in the universe [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6283.219999999999s)]
*  And it's just floating through space and it seeds planets as it intersects [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6289.139999999999s)]
*  All right now over to your wisdom [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6293.46s)]
*  Well, I mean there's no question in my mind of the panspermia model being the real one because [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6295.78s)]
*  We found tardigrades can survive in space where they should there's absolutely no reason that that [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6301.54s)]
*  A life form should be able to survive in space if it originated in earth and yet here we have them [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6307.46s)]
*  So this it's pretty clear that life has evolved and many many many many places it goes to the whole [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6312.34s)]
*  Drake equation which we don't need to get into right now, but if you want to check it out, but the the [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6319.06s)]
*  the reality of [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6325.3s)]
*  Uh life being pervasive around the earth [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfmphk_Ny1o&t=6327.06s)]
