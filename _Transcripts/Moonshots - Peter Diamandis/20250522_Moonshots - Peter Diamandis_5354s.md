# The AI Reset Is Here: Search, Jobs, and Everything Else w/ Anish Acharya, Dave Blundin, Salim Ismail
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [May 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA)
*  This was a big week in AI. I think we've had sort of convergent AI announcements [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=0.0s)]
*  happening. Every day is a miracle and that's not overstating the case. Google [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=7.38s)]
*  has spent 20 years making commitments to an ads ecosystem. Very difficult for [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=12.84s)]
*  them to break those commitments and I think it's a real threat to their search [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=17.04s)]
*  monopoly. The cooler this is and the more search moves over to it, the more it [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=19.68s)]
*  cannibalizes the core. Already my kids are telling me, dad everybody knows that [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=25.36s)]
*  chat GBT is better than Google. 2029 to 2031, the end of white-collar work. That's [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=29.18s)]
*  only a couple years for people to remap their entire career path. We're going [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=35.18s)]
*  from a world where our brains were wired for fear and scarcity to a world that's [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=39.34s)]
*  very different. Technology is a substrate to make us more abundant and [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=45.54s)]
*  happier across every aspect of our lives. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=50.739999999999995s)]
*  Everybody welcome to Moonshots and our weekly episode of WTF Just Happened in [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=59.88s)]
*  Tech. I'm here with my Moonshot mates Dave Blunden and Salim Ismail. Salim by [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=65.06s)]
*  the way, happy birthday this past Saturday. Happy birthday Salim. I sat in the garden [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=72.44s)]
*  with a bottle of wine and a glazed look in my eyes. That's lovely day. And we have a [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=78.36s)]
*  special guest today, Anish Acharya from Andreessen Horowitz. Anish, good to have [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=84.38s)]
*  you joining us. Thank you. Peter Salim Dave says like to be here. Yeah so Anish, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=90.06s)]
*  for those who don't know, heads the consumer investment portfolio at [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=95.25999999999999s)]
*  Andreessen Horowitz, one of the most extraordinary VC funds on the planet. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=101.28s)]
*  He's a general partner there and what I love about Anish's portfolio and his [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=106.06s)]
*  vision is you're running sort of the abundance, the abundance meme, the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=110.66s)]
*  abundance if you would, thematic throughout A16Z which is one of course I love. Yeah. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=117.02s)]
*  Yes we are. Yeah you can't talk about consumer tech these days without talking [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=124.58s)]
*  about abundance and I was telling Peter prior to the show that you know we may [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=128.57999999999998s)]
*  or may not have been inspired by his thoughts on abundance but either way [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=131.85999999999999s)]
*  abundance of abundance right? Exactly right. Now so let's dive in. This has [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=135.86s)]
*  been an incredible week for AI but before we get there Anish I want to talk [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=142.22000000000003s)]
*  about sort of how you and your leadership, your partners at Andreessen [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=147.66000000000003s)]
*  think about abundance because it is a real thing. My next book coming out is [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=153.58s)]
*  called Age of Abundance, How to Survive and Thrive in the Decades Ahead and we're [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=159.10000000000002s)]
*  going from a world where our brains were wired for fear and scarcity to a [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=164.58s)]
*  world that's very different. So here's a slide from your deck from some materials [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=170.54000000000002s)]
*  we stole from your website. So would you mind just giving us a little bit of an [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=178.82000000000002s)]
*  insight on how you think about the abundance agenda? Yeah Peter so maybe to [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=182.42000000000002s)]
*  zoom all the way out and I'm gonna touch on topics I know you've touched on as [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=188.5s)]
*  well so the audience will be familiar but in our belief the two greatest [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=192.14s)]
*  catalysts for human flourishing are market economies and technology right? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=196.22s)]
*  Over and over again through the arc of human history we've seen these two [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=200.66s)]
*  things deliver extraordinary results for human flourishing and the story of the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=204.1s)]
*  last hundred years the sort of industrial age and everything that is [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=208.26s)]
*  coming after the technology age has really been a story of technology and [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=211.01999999999998s)]
*  innovation. So our belief is the more significant the technology and the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=215.06s)]
*  technology change the more significant the sort of results will be for [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=218.98s)]
*  consumers in terms of flourishing and of course abundance. We think about [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=221.98s)]
*  abundance in a lot of ways I love the definition that you used Peter which is [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=225.85999999999999s)]
*  it's not about luxuries it's about possibilities. Yes. That's exactly the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=229.29999999999998s)]
*  sort of thrust with which we've been exploring it. There's a couple of areas [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=233.42s)]
*  in which the technology and the concept of abundance applies but I guess the one [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=238.01999999999998s)]
*  thing I'd sort of give the group for framing is that I think of this as the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=242.14s)]
*  most human technology we've ever built. If you look at technology for the last [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=245.94s)]
*  40 years it's really extended our intellects right and Steve Jobs famously [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=249.98s)]
*  said it's a bicycle for the mind but when he said a bicycle for the mind he [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=254.9s)]
*  really meant a bicycle for the intellect and that's what a spreadsheet is I think [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=257.86s)]
*  it's for me a spreadsheet is it's so like symbolic of all the technology we [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=261.78s)]
*  built for the last 40 years that allows us to do this extraordinary math and [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=266.22s)]
*  computation that we simply couldn't do before and of course it has a ton of [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=269.46s)]
*  implications on human society you know the Fed of course and in all of these [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=273.46s)]
*  other systems that we built rely on all these technologies however we haven't [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=277.46s)]
*  done that much for our sort of souls or for our emotions or for our mindset and [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=281.97999999999996s)]
*  with AI we're able to explore the side of humanity that is sort of defined by [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=285.65999999999997s)]
*  the the sort of subjective emotional experience we've just never had a [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=291.02s)]
*  technology that could be brought to bear so as we talk through all this I would [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=294.02s)]
*  love for folks to keep in mind that you know we're really doing that the sort of [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=297.9s)]
*  left brain right brain pairing that was missing from technology for the last four [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=301.7s)]
*  years that makes sense yeah I had I had an incredible experience actually [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=305.42s)]
*  driving from Vermont back to Boston with my mom who's in her mid 80s and I [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=309.54s)]
*  asked her you know have you ever talked to AI before and she said I don't even [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=314.48s)]
*  know what you're talking about so I put on a chat GPT voice mode put it on the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=318.34000000000003s)]
*  car stereo and she and it's you know beautiful sweet voice comes on crystal [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=322.14s)]
*  clear understands every word that she says and she starts asking about her [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=327.62s)]
*  hometown where she grew up in Ohio and you know whatever happened to the [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=332.02000000000004s)]
*  cheese factory that her father owned and she's like who am I talking to we're [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=335.34s)]
*  talking you're talking to AI but she's like well it must be somebody's [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=340.21999999999997s)]
*  recorded voice I'm like no no it's completely synthetic she was like I [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=342.85999999999996s)]
*  that can't be but you know in this abundance slide you know abundance has [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=346.14s)]
*  always meant include everybody and the internet and its capabilities have [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=350.34s)]
*  largely bypassed you know people that are over a certain age but also the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=354.9s)]
*  vast majority of the really engaging use dominated by young boys playing video [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=359.21999999999997s)]
*  games and that that demographic shift I know and you should know all about this [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=364.8s)]
*  but I'd love to get your thoughts on how this opens up just so many new [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=369.16s)]
*  capabilities across you know users that were not previously users yeah I love [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=372.66s)]
*  that point and you know David it's actually so interesting because what [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=377.08000000000004s)]
*  happens is typically when a new technology is introduced it's sort of it [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=380.58000000000004s)]
*  becomes very hard to grok for the generation that didn't grow up with it [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=384.12s)]
*  and they sort of fumble around and they never get the full achieve the full [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=387.92s)]
*  potential of it but with a lot of AI I think seniors are gonna have the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=391.72s)]
*  experience that your mother had and they're gonna benefit from it [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=396.92s)]
*  disproportionately because they're able to interact with technology now in these [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=400.12s)]
*  unstructured ways a lot of it be a voice I'll give you a great example you know [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=404.04s)]
*  we've got a portfolio company that is an AI nurse now an AI nurse can't you know [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=408.36s)]
*  take your blood so there's only do a subset of nurse related tasks that the [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=413.68s)]
*  AI does but it's a voice nurse that will phone patients and like for a surgery [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=418.0s)]
*  and you know help them to prepare both mentally and also you know go through [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=421.6s)]
*  the checklist and it'll phone them after surgery make sure it's taking folks are [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=425.36s)]
*  taking their medicine and the sort of this impact to health from having that [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=428.72s)]
*  AI nurse take all those actions is dramatic and because it's over the phone [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=435.18s)]
*  and it's be a voice a lot of senior citizens you know they're not intimidated [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=439.32s)]
*  by it so they really stand to disproportionately benefit when we talk [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=442.68s)]
*  about companionship and loneliness I mean this is also an area that's very [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=446.2s)]
*  exciting I think if you look at the last 20 years of technology has applied to [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=450.0s)]
*  relationships it's been social media and we can have a really sort of rigorous [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=453.52s)]
*  conversation about social media but when you look at AI and what the impact is to [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=457.8s)]
*  human relationships it feels like it gives people an opportunity to explore [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=463.32s)]
*  aspects of human relationships in a depth that may not be available to them [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=467.6s)]
*  in their real world you know friendships and sort of family relationships so [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=472.2s)]
*  there's something there that's that's opening Pandora's box here I know because [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=476.44s)]
*  Peter in his latest book and all of his recent research so much of human health [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=480.64s)]
*  and happiness is these little things that you eat or that you do and he's [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=485.32s)]
*  documenting it all now but you're like oh my god like the amount of benefit [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=489.96s)]
*  from just basic behavior change well there's another part which is some of [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=494.2s)]
*  the human happiness is setting a goal and a challenge and overcoming it and [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=498.88s)]
*  the question becomes when these abundance technologies are overcoming [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=504.08s)]
*  the challenges for you right I had an interesting experience today I was in a [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=508.23999999999995s)]
*  escape room with a group of friends and it was Pharaoh's tomb and and we're [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=514.26s)]
*  sitting there having to solve these literally these math equations are on [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=520.12s)]
*  the wall with different symbols and such and I'm hampered by not having a piece [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=523.68s)]
*  of paper and a pen which was you know fundamental technology because you start [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=528.3199999999999s)]
*  to realize how few things you can actually hold in memory and during the [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=532.28s)]
*  course of that and I was so tempted to just pull out my phone and take images [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=537.56s)]
*  and ask chat GPT for the answer and it started to realize that there is a [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=543.0799999999999s)]
*  slippery slope in which we become so dependent on AI that it takes away the [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=548.36s)]
*  challenge is from us unless we hold that you know part of human spirit in place [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=554.4s)]
*  it is a double-edged sword in that way do you think about that Anish? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=561.24s)]
*  Oh good good well I think we've been doing that forever right we move from [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=564.68s)]
*  the slide wheel to the calculator and people said that's a terrible idea and [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=569.88s)]
*  then we move from the calculator to the spreadsheet and people said that's a [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=573.24s)]
*  terrible idea and we keep kind of moving the goal posts on this if you're a [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=576.6s)]
*  software developer used to program and assembly and then we moved to three GLs [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=580.36s)]
*  like Pascal and see and people said well you're losing the benefit of knowing [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=584.5600000000001s)]
*  what's happening and I think we just keep moving the challenge along we don't [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=588.48s)]
*  I think we just shift the goalposts and we change the dynamic of what's going on [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=592.36s)]
*  but it's adding much more capability if I think about what it takes for somebody [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=596.0s)]
*  to compose complex music today it's a thousand times easier than 20 years ago [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=600.28s)]
*  and you just get that much more music I think that's what feeds into the [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=604.8s)]
*  abundance thing we just can create so much more. But is it so much more crap or [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=608.68s)]
*  is it so much more what's the filtering system? Crap for one is gold for the other [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=612.88s)]
*  maybe. And funny enough I remember growing up as an engineer coming up [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=617.84s)]
*  hearing hey if engineers don't know how to do memory management then they're [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=622.96s)]
*  not real engineers so this is the you're right this has happened over and over [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=626.36s)]
*  again look with that said I agree with you Peter that I think there's there's a [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=629.12s)]
*  level of agreeableness that is too much and I think we need these models and [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=632.6s)]
*  these AI technologies to also explore that the short uncomfortable aspects of [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=637.32s)]
*  the human experience you know which is disagreement persuasion sexuality and you [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=641.52s)]
*  know I don't want to jump ahead but this is one of the reasons I think the [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=647.04s)]
*  incumbents have struggled so much with it because there's a thousand committees [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=649.36s)]
*  working at Apple and Google that are explicitly designed to take the [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=653.16s)]
*  humanity out of their products and these are fundamentally human technologies so [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=656.66s)]
*  but look I also agree with your underlying point which is every person [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=660.68s)]
*  needs to feel like they have meaningful purpose even if it's created for them if [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=664.28s)]
*  it's a little bit synthetic and without that the flourishing point starts to get [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=668.8s)]

*  There is another quick point I want to hit both you and Anish and Saleem which is [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=732.64s)]
*  at the end point of continued increasing abundance comes a post-capitalist society [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=738.8s)]
*  where money has little to no meaning and I'm not sure how a venture capital firm [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=745.92s)]
*  thinks and deals with that. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=752.64s)]
*  A I think we're far enough away that we don't have to worry about that right away but I think one thing [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=754.48s)]
*  that I'm encouraged by with all of this is that we may break through the whole Douglas Adams framing. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=760.24s)]
*  When he wrote Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy he said anything that's invented when you're born [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=767.0400000000001s)]
*  or that's in the world when you're born we call that normal anything that's invented when you're [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=772.32s)]
*  young that's called a career and anything invented after you're 35 years old is just bad for the world. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=776.48s)]
*  Talk to any banker about bitcoin and they freak out and whatever. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=782.5600000000001s)]
*  I think that these technologies as we humanize them make it easy for 80 year olds to interact [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=785.52s)]
*  decently with technology in a very humane way and I think that opens up again abundance, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=791.44s)]
*  new dimensions open up. I think it's powerful as hell. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=796.16s)]
*  We always say internally that human relationships are fundamental to the experience of flourishing. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=799.28s)]
*  Maybe the human part is overstated. Maybe it's just relationships and as long as we feel the [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=805.28s)]
*  feelings that result from the conversations who cares who's on the other side. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=810.08s)]
*  You know one of the questions I have and I just put forward the second slide here which is market [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=813.36s)]
*  opportunities is as we get to let's forget about AGI let's skip ahead to you know ASI, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=818.48s)]
*  artificial super intelligence. The question as you know Dave and I are and yourself and Nisha we're [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=826.72s)]
*  all VCs we're finding incubating supporting incredible entrepreneurs and startup companies [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=833.6s)]
*  but the big question is what moats are going to continue as we go forward? How do you differentiate [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=842.24s)]
*  yourself and prevent yourself from being disintermediated by the next entrepreneur [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=849.28s)]
*  with a with a faster set of you know age enabled systems? Do you think about that? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=854.72s)]
*  All the time yeah there's two answers to it. Let me give you a maybe a cute answer and then I'll [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=862.1600000000001s)]
*  give you a specific answer. So my cute answer is that abundance means abundance of categories as [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=866.48s)]
*  well and there'll be many new categories areas for consumer spend and business spend and what [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=871.2800000000001s)]
*  happens when new technologies are introduced is the incumbents often get better at what they do [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=876.08s)]
*  today. So I think Microsoft will make a better word processor and Google might make a better [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=880.64s)]
*  search engine but search engines and word processor will be less relevant and there'll be new [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=884.96s)]
*  categories that pop up where the sort of new entrants dominate. On your specific question you [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=889.68s)]
*  know you guys understand the technology at a fine level so you understand that these systems are [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=894.4799999999999s)]
*  very good at predicting static systems. They're very good at sort of averaging the training data [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=899.3599999999999s)]
*  and telling you you know what the training data implies. They're not very good at predicting [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=904.56s)]
*  adaptive systems like the stock market or even culture and music. So as a thought experiment if [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=908.8s)]
*  you trained an AI model with all the music you know right up to hip-hop but not including hip-hop [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=914.16s)]
*  would it you know infer what it imply hip-hop? I don't think so because culture and music is [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=919.76s)]
*  this sort of adaptive system that works together. So I really do think that there's a you know [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=925.1999999999999s)]
*  motes that are based on adaptive systems and network is a great example are actually as good [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=930.8s)]
*  as gold and they always have been. Motes that are based on sort of static systems like integration [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=936.16s)]
*  modes systems of record I think are really at risk. Interesting. Do you want to walk us through [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=942.72s)]
*  this next slide here on market opportunity? Yeah I mean consumer investing is very interesting [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=947.52s)]
*  because it's hypercyclic. So when consumer works you get the biggest companies in the world as you [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=952.24s)]
*  can see from the slide here and when consumer is not working it's really not working. We're now in [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=957.0400000000001s)]
*  a product cycle that's as important as the internet. I think it's probably more significant than mobile [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=962.0s)]
*  and the biggest winners I believe are going to be consumer winners and every consumer [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=968.1600000000001s)]
*  behavior including some ones that don't exist today are up for grabs. So all of which is to say [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=972.32s)]
*  it's a great time to be a builder or be around builders as all of us are. Dave what do you think [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=977.12s)]
*  about that? Well I totally agree. I think a lot about the fact that you know some of the mid-journey [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=982.1600000000001s)]
*  actually I think is an A16Z darling where the you know cash flow gets into hundreds of millions of [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=987.2800000000001s)]
*  dollars of very high margin revenue and the cost of the build you know because coding is getting so [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=993.7600000000001s)]
*  cheap and so automated the cost of a build of something like that is lower than ever. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=999.52s)]
*  So you've got very rapid growth of the revenue, very low capital costs, nothing to lose by jumping [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1003.68s)]
*  in there. Now you know the question always comes up what's your mode you know is it going to be [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1010.88s)]
*  defensible over the long term but you're so profitable so quickly while you explore that [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1014.72s)]
*  that there's no downside and we know now that you know the management teams have to pivot over time [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1019.4399999999999s)]
*  that's just the nature of tech going forward. It always will be. Continuously right? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1024.72s)]
*  Continuously so they have to learn that skill anyway why not learn it while growing like crazy [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1028.72s)]
*  and being profitable. So I like the idea of not being worried about it but it is still I think [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1034.32s)]
*  worth exploring a couple of fundamental questions while we have a niche which is you know if you if [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1038.56s)]
*  you look at consumer as a whole a lot of the frameworks are defined by the big guys so the [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1043.52s)]
*  app store is really not it's not you know a fact of nature it's defined by what Apple and Google [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1048.56s)]
*  decide here's a framework that you can operate in and you know if you go way back in time you [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1054.24s)]
*  know the early days of Apple and Microsoft the ISV market independent software vendors they were [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1059.04s)]
*  also defined and then Microsoft changed its mind one day and said you know what spreadsheets and [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1063.84s)]
*  word processors those are ours now and sorry you set up your camp there Lotus but we're going to [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1067.68s)]
*  just take that back. So you do have to be conscious of the fact that if you're on top of a big LLM [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1073.84s)]
*  you're top of a heavily funded company you know you have to predict what they will and won't do [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1079.84s)]
*  inside their core $200 or $240 a month service offering and be outside of that but not too far [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1084.3999999999999s)]
*  outside so I don't know how you think about that. It's a great point and actually I worried a lot [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1091.12s)]
*  about that when we were in the early days post-December 2022 and it felt like OpenAI [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1094.6399999999999s)]
*  was the only foundation model game in town because in that world OpenAI you know they just raise [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1099.36s)]
*  prices and take 100% of the economics that are downstream from them because now we look we've [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1104.32s)]
*  got a bunch of foundation model companies that have great models we have got a bunch of open [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1109.28s)]
*  source models that are super competitive because of that you see OpenAI and other companies trying [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1114.96s)]
*  to move up the stack they bought Windsurf which is really interesting and as an application [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1119.76s)]
*  developer you're not dependent on any single platform I mean if you're an iOS app developer [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1124.8799999999999s)]
*  there's only one game in town that's the Apple App Store the web is not that way and the AI game [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1129.12s)]
*  is not that way either because of the presence of multiple foundation models. You know on your point [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1134.96s)]
*  Dave actually if I may on Mid Journey as well I think there's an interesting note there you talk [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1141.2s)]
*  about defensibility but what's happened in that market is it's fragmented and now you see Mid [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1144.64s)]
*  Journey is a really interesting player that points in a specific aesthetic direction its image [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1149.76s)]
*  generation and it creates these beautiful hyper realistic images but they have a very specific [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1154.4s)]
*  aesthetic if you're a designer that's looking for a different aesthetic or more controllability [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1159.52s)]
*  you'll work with a company like a crea or an ideogram that has a whole different aesthetic [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1164.0s)]
*  and as a result you've got two companies that both to image generation that are pointed in [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1169.04s)]
*  different directions and there's a broader comment here I think which is when we have [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1173.92s)]
*  new technology these markets are expansive in the same way the universe is and [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1177.76s)]
*  companies tend to move away from each other over time not toward each other. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1181.84s)]
*  Yeah I really want to riff on that while we have you because it's really clear to me that the number [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1186.0s)]
*  of opportunities way outstrips the number of teams and yes a lot of people are intimidated [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1191.36s)]
*  and they're like oh isn't Mid Journey or isn't you know OpenAI going to do this this this and [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1198.32s)]
*  this but you're you're pointing out I think a really critical and inspiring point and just the [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1202.7199999999998s)]
*  aesthetic difference alone creates a new market but I think you were talking about digital makeup on [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1208.0s)]
*  one of your podcasts just as a category like oh there's something that's actually a that's a [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1213.12s)]
*  company that's a product that's actually defensible. It's amazing and I think the other [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1218.08s)]
*  amazing thing Dave is if you look at the price points that these products are commanding you [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1221.84s)]
*  know Spotify's most expensive plan I looked this up the other day the family plan with lossless [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1225.76s)]
*  audio is $20 a month that's their it doesn't get better than that for Spotify chat gbt it's 200 a [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1230.32s)]
*  month Google just announced a $250 a month plan that's consumer prosumer facing so in my view in [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1236.3999999999999s)]
*  the future consumers will have food rent and software as the three biggest destinations for [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1242.72s)]
*  their spend. Not bad with them. A lot of companies are overlooking the fact that you know when you [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1247.6s)]
*  go live with one of these directly consumer facing products and it hits it's global instantaneously [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1256.6399999999999s)]
*  and so if you think about a $10 $20 a month subscription but you get 30 40 50 million people [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1262.8s)]
*  that's a small fraction of 8 billion but that can happen very easily within a lot of different [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1267.9199999999998s)]
*  categories so it's just so many opportunities relative to the number of teams. Quav I need [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1273.12s)]
*  to just draw into something digital makeup? Yeah yeah well I mean look you know you mean the [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1277.44s)]
*  like on zoom or something where you can just have different I mean I you know you can be anyone you [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1286.48s)]
*  want to be in the AI world Salim so we should debrief later. Well I choose to be a bold [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1291.6000000000001s)]
*  gleamy head fellow. As do I. As do I. Wow. All right so here we are third slide before we jump [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1296.4s)]
*  into our AI universe you know that's been just exploding this week so AI yeah use cases please. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1305.12s)]
*  Great yeah so maybe like I'll touch on each of these in turn very quickly so creativity, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1312.08s)]
*  productivity, the thing about creativity that's so interesting is that we all grow up believing [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1316.1599999999999s)]
*  we're creative right we all drew pictures and colored pictures and we're three four five [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1321.04s)]
*  and then we get to a point in our lives where we start to self-select into being good at it or bad [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1325.28s)]
*  at it. We're talking about the technical skill when we say that not the inspiration behind it [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1329.6799999999998s)]
*  so with AI the technical skill of being creative gets separated from the inspiration behind being [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1334.48s)]
*  creative and if there's something that you can dream of making whether it's music or art or video [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1339.76s)]
*  you can make it now which I think is just incredibly abundant from a consumer impact perspective. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1344.72s)]
*  You know we talked about companionship, social, the experience that you had Dave in the car and [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1350.32s)]
*  in the car ride like this is bringing empathetic patient maybe disagreeable human relationships to [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1355.52s)]
*  everyone that wants one which has a normal enormous implications from a flourishing perspective and [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1362.64s)]
*  you know finally wellness and personal growth I think so much of this if you look at something [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1368.4s)]
*  like finance I worked in fintech and financial services and you know you quickly realize that [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1373.0400000000002s)]
*  fintech is not about helping people make rational choices it's about exploring the non-rational [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1378.16s)]
*  parts of our relationship with money and AI is uniquely suited to help us helping us get better [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1383.92s)]
*  around that so you know this technology is a substrate to make us more abundant and happier [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1389.84s)]
*  across every aspect of our lives. Love to get your thoughts on you know there's so much on this slide [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1396.24s)]
*  because there's so many different facets and you know historically when you looked at a founding [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1401.1999999999998s)]
*  team you're looking for your Steve Jobs visionary married to your Steve Wozniak engineering genius [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1406.1599999999999s)]
*  but now that engineering component is largely AI automatable and the vision of the perfect [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1410.56s)]
*  founding team you know looks different and being able to navigate through so many choices just on [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1417.2s)]
*  this slide alone and come up with the perfect strategy that's got to be the rare commodity I [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1423.3600000000001s)]
*  assume right? I actually I have to disagree you know we're seeing more technical founders be more [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1427.1200000000001s)]
*  successful over and over again yes AI extends their capabilities and makes them more productive [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1432.8s)]
*  but there's so much work at the edge that AI is not going to do so we're really seeing a sort of [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1438.0s)]
*  rise in the dominance of an engineering oriented founding team in the way that we haven't in you [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1443.28s)]
*  know 10 or 15 years in core tech. Well the Fred Wilson rule you know always said hey we're looking [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1448.0s)]
*  for three or more founders best friends who write the code themselves yeah is that when you say [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1453.12s)]
*  technical founders you're talking about former engineers wrote code at google I mean similar [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1457.84s)]
*  to yourself. I'll tell you one of our most fun investments is a company called CREA which is a [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1462.16s)]
*  really cutting edge sort of research and consumer technology company that brings together all of the [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1467.52s)]
*  creative tools in one product so image generation video generation image enhancement etc. These are [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1472.24s)]
*  two incredible AI researchers and sort of artists and enthusiasts they live in a house up in Pack [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1478.24s)]
*  Heights they live with all their engineers they work seven days a week you know I mean the first [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1484.08s)]
*  board meeting they sat me down and said Anish we've got a problem what is it well our house only has [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1490.0s)]
*  10 bedrooms what happens when we get our 11th employee? I said well you know maybe we shouldn't [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1494.64s)]
*  all be living together at scale but that's a sort of separate conversation so that's the intensity [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1499.36s)]
*  and how sort of technical they are in their leadership. Which is a beautiful thing I mean [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1504.08s)]
*  honestly the most the most success and the most fun I've ever had as an entrepreneur is when I'm [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1508.6399999999999s)]
*  living that monomaniacal singular focus effort in life. Yeah I gotta tell you we bought an apartment [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1516.1599999999999s)]
*  building right on the edge of MIT and Harvard's campus it's actually the closest building to MIT [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1523.84s)]
*  that wasn't already owned by MIT we bought it a couple weeks ago it has 24 beds and it six units [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1528.72s)]
*  for exactly this reason. Amazing amazing. So you were going to say? Yeah so if you if you're a [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1535.68s)]
*  product visionary that wants to use AI in a totally different domain then surely you can acquire the [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1542.16s)]
*  technology capability at low cost you don't have to be the technical founder in a sense in that [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1549.3600000000001s)]
*  sense. Is that not an option that you're seeing? I think it absolutely is it is a question of do [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1554.48s)]
*  you want to be sort of at the edge of technology and new models in which case you probably do need [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1560.32s)]
*  to be if there's a plenty of off-the-shelf tools and products like cursor make it a lot easier for [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1564.64s)]
*  somebody's even you know familiar in a cursory way no pun intended to bring products to market. So [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1569.84s)]
*  all the above absolutely yeah. I would say that when the companies that are thriving right now in [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1576.48s)]
*  your portfolio when they started their journey just a year or two ago sweetbench was maybe 10% [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1583.28s)]
*  and now it's suddenly 60% so if you look forward a year at the rate that that's changing you would [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1590.24s)]
*  have to assume that to some degree orchestrating the AI agents becomes the dominant because right [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1597.12s)]
*  now if you're if you're going to build something on top of h-gen or on something on prim you're [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1602.16s)]
*  going to be mostly coding it up with cursor so it helps you but you're still coding it up [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1607.68s)]
*  but there's some kind of a paradigm shift coming you know you could debate whether it's three months [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1612.8s)]
*  from now a year from now two years from now but it's coming. I agree I completely. Anish what [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1616.56s)]
*  percentage of your companies in the abundance portfolio are AI and how many would you put in [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1620.6399999999999s)]
*  the in the bucket of physical robotics or biotech or nanotech or 3d printing non-ai exponential tech? [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1627.76s)]
*  So I'm focused on consumer software I think if you look at that theme as a substrate across the [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1638.3999999999999s)]
*  firm many of our investments many of our American dynamism investments are also very much in that [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1643.9199999999998s)]
*  vein but you know in terms of software largely all of our investments there's one or two that [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1649.1999999999998s)]
*  aren't direct AI companies today but that's very much sort of a part of the strategy and on the come [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1655.6799999999998s)]
*  you know it just begs the question of if you're focused on delivering abundant outcomes [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1661.6s)]
*  and you're not thinking about AI like why how can you be? Everyone as you know earlier this year [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1666.0s)]
*  I was on stage at the Abundance Summit with some incredible individuals Kathy Wood, Mo Gadot, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1671.84s)]
*  Vinod Khosla, Brett Adcock and many other amazing tech CEOs. I'm always asked hey Peter where can I [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1676.8s)]
*  see the summit? Well I'm finally releasing all the talks you can access my conversation with Kathy [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1683.44s)]
*  Wood and Mo Gadot for free at diamandis.com slash summit that's the talk with Kathy Wood and Mo Gadot [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1689.44s)]
*  for free at diamandis.com slash summit. Enjoy I'll ask my team to put the links in the show notes below. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1696.96s)]
*  Moving on this was a big week in AI I think we've had sort of convergent AI announcements happening. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1704.88s)]
*  I am curious why everybody's announcing on top of each other but let's take a look so today May [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1713.04s)]
*  20th and tomorrow it's Google I.O. unveils Gemini updates and Android ecosystem bets. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1718.88s)]
*  On the 22nd Anthropic is debuting code with Claude 2025 its first dev conference and then also this [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1726.3200000000002s)]
*  week Microsoft Build 2025 focuses on copilot, scale out AI, infra and dev tooling and of course [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1733.5200000000002s)]
*  we've got Nvidia making announcements and we'll talk about Elon's Grok 2.5 announcements. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1741.0400000000002s)]
*  What's the I mean I'm in LA, Salim's in New York, Dave's in Boston, you're in the Bay Area. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1747.2s)]
*  What's the sort of what's the feeling like right now where you are? I mean the the every day is a [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1754.3999999999999s)]
*  miracle and that's not overstating the case every I mean just this on Friday opening I released Codex [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1760.72s)]
*  which is an autonomous software agent that simply writes pull requests which for you to review by [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1767.2s)]
*  the way on your phone if you'd like like every single day I mean any one of these things could [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1773.8400000000001s)]
*  be the basis of an entire ecosystem and you know you're showing three for this week. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1779.6000000000001s)]
*  It's crazy we talked about Codex last week. Here's a fun article. Dave well actually maybe I should [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1783.6000000000001s)]
*  say you're giving to our brethren from of Indian descent but Dave you want to set this one up. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1792.16s)]
*  India plans made in India chips by 2025 and its own GPUs in three to five years. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1797.84s)]
*  You picked this slide. Yeah this was really important to talk about coming on the heels [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1804.0s)]
*  of Saudi Arabia which we talked about a couple days ago. So every country that wants to be [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1808.3999999999999s)]
*  competitive in the future needs to have some kind of an AI strategy and then you know that [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1814.8799999999999s)]
*  boils down right now to having your own supply of chips because the chips are going to be [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1818.56s)]
*  unbelievably constrained for at least the next three or four years maybe maybe forever [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1822.1599999999999s)]
*  into the future. But some of these more consumer facing use cases that involve voices and now [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1826.4s)]
*  multimodal imagery you know they'll use up an entire GPU two GPUs four GPUs concurrently to [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1831.68s)]
*  get the best possible user experience and that's not super expensive. So it's easily worth it for [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1838.4s)]
*  the consumer but the chips don't exist they physically don't exist. We're going to make 20 [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1843.92s)]
*  million new GPUs this year. It's nowhere near enough to keep up with just basic call center [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1848.48s)]
*  use cases. So countries that have their act together are starting to think do we need our [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1854.32s)]
*  own fabs? Well India is saying well if we're going to compete we definitely need fabs [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1860.24s)]
*  starting with 14 nanometer but you got a long way to go from there. Okay great this is exactly [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1863.84s)]
*  the right thing to do but then in their own internal research document and plan it says [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1869.12s)]
*  we expect this to be underutilized and bureaucratic. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1874.1599999999999s)]
*  Like holy crap they're trying to get a sovereign strategy together so we'll have to keep a close [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1877.44s)]
*  eye on it but you know they're probably you know on the order of 50 maybe 100 other countries that [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1885.3600000000001s)]
*  need to immediately you know get on the tails of this same exact thing. William what are your [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1890.0s)]
*  thoughts here? We're advising one of the big southeast Asian countries on exactly this and [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1894.88s)]
*  we're basically saying you have to develop your own fabrication capabilities there's just no other [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1899.76s)]
*  way around it and the learning that will come from that will be very powerful one way or the other [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1904.16s)]
*  if only to select who the best supplier is going forward because there's going to be [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1910.0s)]
*  we're going to end up with an abundance and a different architecture is coming from different [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1914.5600000000002s)]
*  places that will all pull together. India specifically I mean the bureaucracy is insane [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1918.16s)]
*  there's so many overlapping federal at state level etc etc. It's you know I always talk to [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1924.4s)]
*  people and saying don't think of India as a country it's more like Europe with 20 different [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1931.76s)]
*  major languages and different tensions and cultures etc etc. You have to look at it from [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1935.44s)]
*  that perspective and then it makes a little bit more sense. You know one thing also you know [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1942.48s)]
*  Nvidia now today is worth as of right now over twice as much as Meta and almost twice as much [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1947.12s)]
*  as Google and like well how can that be and you know especially Google where you know the [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1953.68s)]
*  transformer was invented at Google you know Google Cloud GCP is huge they have their own [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1959.04s)]
*  TPU7s which are incredible like does this make any sense and that's you know that's debatable [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1965.68s)]
*  but the chip demand is such a dominant factor and then underneath that the fab shortage is such a [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1971.6000000000001s)]
*  dominant factor and it's not a secret you know it's amazing to me how many people don't know this but [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1979.6000000000001s)]
*  Elon Musk is video podcasting it out you know we absolutely need to accelerate our fab production [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1983.36s)]
*  and I was talking to Kaveh Kazirshahi over at Allen & Company and they're looking at these new [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1989.9199999999998s)]
*  four billion dollar fabs you know normally a fab is a 20 to 40 billion dollar investment [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1995.04s)]
*  but there's some new designs that are more around the four billion dollar mark that might actually [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=1999.76s)]
*  unclog the machinery and those are those are really interesting to study and track but you know [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2004.4799999999998s)]
*  for India the perfect scenario is hey let's get some some four billion dollar fabs up and running [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2009.2s)]
*  start on 14 nanometer but quickly work our way down to five nanometer [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2013.8400000000001s)]
*  so how quickly do these obsolete themselves and you know if you're pumping out 14 nanometer [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2017.6000000000001s)]
*  GPUs are you know are they going to be useful and compete with sort of the cutting edge at a TSMC? [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2023.76s)]
*  No no not at all they're not even vaguely competitive they'll all be fully sold out for a [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2031.6000000000001s)]
*  long time but the fabs themselves are actually very sustainable you know most of the machinery [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2036.08s)]
*  in there even when you upgrade most of the machinery you reuse so the EUV component is [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2041.76s)]
*  an exception to that but most of the rest of the of the pipeline you can you can reuse over and [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2046.96s)]
*  over again so the key is just you know get on the map get something up and running and then you can [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2051.36s)]
*  work it down you know as as you move forward you know just reduce the lithography as you go [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2055.52s)]
*  but you know I do think that the other thing that's really affecting this is if you have your fab act [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2060.7999999999997s)]
*  together AI is getting really good at chip design I was working on that a couple weekends ago [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2066.24s)]
*  and so your cycle time can come way down and so you know because there's going to be algorithmic [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2071.3599999999997s)]
*  breakthroughs all the time now and also that will affect the designs right away but you can automate [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2076.8799999999997s)]
*  that pipeline so that the new algorithm immediately gets a new chip design get that right into the queue [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2082.16s)]
*  almost in real time and then you have to wait a month or two for something to come out the other [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2087.2s)]
*  side but that machinery if you get that that fully integrated which no one's ever worked on before [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2090.7999999999997s)]
*  because you know a microprocessor design would last for a full year and so you never really thought [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2096.96s)]
*  about real-time design using AI automation so now it's a completely different world just how this [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2101.6s)]
*  pipeline should shake out. Manish any thoughts on this one? Yeah it's really interesting I mean [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2107.68s)]
*  yeah it's really interesting I mean presuming we do resolve the sort of shortage of chips which I [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2112.7999999999997s)]
*  believe that we will there's also I mean it's sustains a need for countries to build a sovereign [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2119.2s)]
*  AI because the AIs embed values within them which is why DeepSeq is such an interesting conversation [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2124.9599999999996s)]
*  because arguably DeepSeq is trained with a set of values that may be a mismatch with western values [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2130.64s)]
*  and every country needs to think about what are the values that they want to imbue into their AIs [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2136.7999999999997s)]
*  so there's a very something very interesting here which almost looks I'm not sure if you guys are [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2141.7599999999998s)]
*  familiar with the Jones Act for ships that operate in and around US ports they must be [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2145.2799999999997s)]
*  manufactured in the United States for national security purposes I believe we'll see a sort of [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2150.48s)]
*  Jones Act for AI where AI that operates you know in sort of sensitive contexts will have to have [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2154.48s)]
*  been trained nationally. That's a great insight I don't think anyone's ever drawn that analogy [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2160.56s)]
*  before but I love love that insight you know really it's really clear that if you if you don't [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2166.0s)]
*  have a national strategy for compute the you know during this era where the chips are constrained [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2172.72s)]
*  the highest value use cases are just going to buy out all the data centers and it would be very [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2180.64s)]
*  natural for one or two economies like US and China to have a higher standard of living and then say [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2185.12s)]
*  well because I can overbid the Indian or the Ethiopian they don't get access to any compute [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2191.12s)]
*  and that goes on for one year two years three years four years and that's the natural cycle [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2197.2s)]
*  if you don't have a national strategy to get compute for your citizens so once you start [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2202.32s)]
*  getting behind you're going to get way behind and then you're economically unable to get back on the [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2206.08s)]
*  map. All right our next story here we've been hearing about this forever and looks like we're [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2209.84s)]
*  on the verge of GPT-5 being released so here are some tweets that went out just got to try an early [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2216.72s)]
*  GPT-5 just wow it can do anything I can do at a computer but much quicker we actually made it [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2224.9599999999996s)]
*  and this is from at this is Chris at GPT-21 GPT-5 is in red teaming this is not a guess this has been [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2231.6s)]
*  confirmed so when I think about GPT-5 I think about self-recursive improving AI software you [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2241.04s)]
*  know recoding AI and leading to an intelligence explosion I think about PhD level capabilities or [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2249.36s)]
*  multi-phD level capabilities what do you think of when you when you hear GPT-5 Dave Anish what do [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2257.52s)]
*  you guys think about? Well actually before we jump into there's so much to talk about there but before [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2264.48s)]
*  we jump into it you notice how they always jump on each other so Google I.O. oh my gosh I gotta get [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2269.2s)]
*  something right on top of them this is not you pointed it out before Peter but this is not [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2275.2799999999997s)]
*  coincidence and and notice how Apple isn't even trying they're just completely invisible. Yeah [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2279.3599999999997s)]
*  we'll talk about that Apple is opted out. Yeah what do you think about GPT-5? Yeah I mean if we've seen [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2283.6s)]
*  so many exciting model releases since the GPT-5 conversation started and we've seen a new model [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2291.12s)]
*  architecture with their reasoning models so you know I feel like we're seeing all the steps that [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2296.16s)]
*  point in the direction of GPT-5 I don't know that there's a big unveil coming that will show us [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2301.2s)]
*  something that isn't implied by what we've seen so far and if you look at the reasoning models which [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2305.52s)]
*  actually are just as important of an innovation as the language models you know they are these [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2310.7999999999997s)]
*  models that are trained through reinforcement learning on specific domains which is why they [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2315.6s)]
*  work so well for coding but we still need to go collect the data sets and build the models for [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2320.16s)]
*  all of the domains that have a formal concept of correctness so before we have something that is [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2325.36s)]
*  as broad-based as you're describing Peter which I'm sure we will have someday there's just an [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2330.2400000000002s)]
*  enormous amount of model work to do between here and there so look my belief is we'll see something [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2334.56s)]
*  that looks more like 04 or 03 pro than a completely different animal. Yeah I'm still waiting for [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2338.6400000000003s)]
*  someday my cell phone to ring I pick it up and it goes hi Peter this is GPT-5 that's why I [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2345.92s)]
*  introduce myself I'm here if you need anything you know I'm just that will become a spooky future. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2351.36s)]
*  I want the model to your point Peter that that is Jarvis right it just goes okay what do you need [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2359.52s)]
*  right now and it can go and make suggestions and just get to that personal level that we're [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2365.04s)]
*  waiting for. I interviewed Sam Altman at the MIT Media Labs a year and a half ago now and I tried [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2370.56s)]
*  to get him to open up about parameter count where parameter count is going and he said look [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2378.0s)]
*  we need to stop masturbating over parameter count. The crowd loved it there's like a 1500 MIT [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2382.24s)]
*  students in the crowd they loved it but uh but then I now now I can't track just the raw parameter [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2388.32s)]
*  counts I'm hoping with GPT-5 we can still distinguish between okay here's the model producing [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2393.12s)]
*  in an answer which was should be mind-blowingly intelligent and then here's the chain of thought [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2399.28s)]
*  reasoning version because you know the chain of thought reasoning like you said Anish is adding [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2403.68s)]
*  immensely more uh you know feeling of intelligence than the core model is and I think you know open [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2408.64s)]
*  AI kind of wants to tie it all together and say look don't worry about it it's just one subscription [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2415.2s)]
*  here's all the brilliance we don't want to talk about what came from where but you know as an as [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2419.68s)]
*  an MIT oriented research I want to know actually what came from where yes which I can do with llama [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2424.3199999999997s)]
*  but it's becoming increasingly difficult with GPT-5 yes that that being said I think it's going [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2429.6s)]
*  to blow our minds and it they wouldn't be putting it out if it wasn't mind-blowing everything [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2435.2s)]
*  you know the prior step functions have all been mind-blowing so that's one let me let me ask you [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2440.08s)]
*  it as a question what's if you had a guess as to what capabilities are in GPT-5 versus GPT-4 what [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2444.08s)]
*  would be a standout feature right it's definitely you know everything's fully multimodal now and [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2450.16s)]
*  the the language and that has been phenomenal even in GPT-4 but once you start marrying it to [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2454.56s)]
*  images you know right now when you prompt it to create an image or a video for you or you show it [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2459.04s)]
*  an image it's good and it's mind-blowing but it's not it's not perfect I think you know if you take [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2463.44s)]
*  your digital nurse example that Anish was talking about hey let me show a rash on my foot it's going [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2469.2799999999997s)]
*  to diagnose it perfectly and you know you need a lot of long-tail images to do that kind of stuff [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2475.68s)]
*  so I expect there'll be a lot in that category since they've had more time to work on the [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2481.52s)]
*  multimodal that just didn't exist you know when they when they built GPT-4 and 4.5 you know I keep [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2485.6s)]
*  on thinking about uh situ you know leopold situ situational awareness paper that came out [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2490.96s)]
*  a couple years ago right showing basically on the heels of GPT-5 just an acceleration of AI [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2496.72s)]
*  right you know we've started to see this we've started to see the speed uh as you know if you [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2504.08s)]
*  want even human IQ points that these models are increasingly getting capabilities so you know do [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2509.2s)]
*  we get a unconstrained intelligence explosion on the on the back of this that's what for me is [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2516.48s)]
*  interesting um and you should do something I'm really expecting uh in consumer is you know how [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2523.12s)]
*  you know in a podcast like this if you don't like the way the audio recording comes out there there [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2530.64s)]
*  are always tools to clean up audio yes but now you have tools that will actually recreate it from [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2534.3199999999997s)]
*  scratch using your voice so you can create anything out of anything yes when you start [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2538.56s)]
*  talking about multimodal video yeah and you say here's a static image it should be able to [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2542.24s)]
*  instantly turn it into a 3d you know movable any angle you know scenario and I think it'll have [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2546.7999999999997s)]
*  that capability well we have I mean we I would argue guys we have a lot of these capabilities [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2552.72s)]
*  so CREA today can do what you're describing Dave and taking a static image and turning it into a [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2556.64s)]
*  sort of 3d splat um in terms of how good the multimodal models are like I can tell you when [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2561.68s)]
*  I'm barbecuing at the house I'll have gpt 4o looking at my hot peppers you know that are [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2566.88s)]
*  grilling and I'll be saying are they ready yet are they ready yet are they ready yet [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2572.96s)]
*  no no no no yes they're ready I mean that's what I did this weekend so that works and okay and each [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2576.7200000000003s)]
*  step away from the air I may have gone too deep guys I may not be able to find my way out and then [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2582.96s)]
*  look I actually think from if you want Jarvis Salim I think we have a Jarvis today in the form [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2590.1600000000003s)]
*  of operator you know operator to me is the most underappreciated new open AI launch and it's been [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2595.04s)]
*  around for a while and it allows anybody to use the web essentially every UI becomes an API [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2601.2s)]
*  and you can use the web as this sort of control surface to do anything like the implications of [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2608.24s)]
*  that are so significant just think of the mundane use cases as a consumer every day I wake up and [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2613.36s)]
*  it goes and checks for a lower you know auto insurance and a better personal loan rate for me [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2618.72s)]
*  and it spends the day scouring the web and it refinances all of my you know my credit lines and [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2624.48s)]
*  then I get a push notification at the end of the day saying hey Anisha cleaned all this stuff up [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2629.84s)]
*  for you you're gonna save 200 a month and please send my commission to this yeah that's right [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2633.76s)]
*  like that's all possible today I'd argue we have more you know just as you talked you said there's [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2642.8s)]
*  like more ideas than teams Dave like we have these magical miraculous new capabilities that [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2647.6s)]
*  are underexplored because there's so many of all right let's let's head to to muskville Elon musk [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2652.88s)]
*  unveils grok 3.5 ai that reasons from first principles let's hear it from Elon's voice [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2658.88s)]
*  directly so really the focus of grok 3.5 is sort of a fundamental to physics and applying physics [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2666.1600000000003s)]
*  tools across all lines of reasoning and to aspire to truth with minimal error like there's always [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2675.44s)]
*  going to be some mistakes that are made but aim to get to truth with acknowledged error but minimized [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2683.6s)]
*  at error over time and I think that's actually extremely important for ai safety my ultimate [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2692.56s)]
*  conclusion is the the old maxim that honesty is the best policy a quick aside you probably heard [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2700.0s)]
*  me speaking about fountain life before and you're probably wishing Peter would you please stop talking [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2705.76s)]
*  about fountain life and the answer is no I won't because genuinely we're living through a health [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2710.64s)]
*  care crisis you may not know this but 70 percent of heart attacks have no precedence no pain no [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2715.76s)]
*  shortness of breath and half of those people with a heart attack never wake up you don't feel cancer [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2720.56s)]
*  until stage three or stage four until it's too late but we have all the technology required to [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2725.84s)]
*  detect and prevent these diseases early at scale that's why a group of us including Tony Robbins [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2731.28s)]
*  Bill Kapp and Bob Haruri founded fountain life a one-stop center to help people understand what's [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2737.04s)]
*  going on inside their bodies before it's too late and to gain access to the therapeutics to give them [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2742.4s)]
*  decades of extra health span learn more about what's going on inside your body from fountain [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2748.08s)]
*  life go to fountainlife.com slash Peter and tell them Peter sent you okay back to the episode okay [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2752.32s)]
*  so how do you guys feel about the the basic concepts of grok of maximally truth-seeking [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2761.04s)]
*  ai and then what i do love is the idea of applied physics [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2769.36s)]
*  uh as part of in first principle thinking as part of its uh ed structure uh Anish what does that [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2773.7599999999998s)]
*  sound like to you does it sound real is inspiring no it's but it sounds consistent with what we're [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2782.24s)]
*  seeing from reasoning models so i think a reasoning model trained around physics would do what he's [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2787.04s)]
*  describing i do think honesty is the best policy and and you know i i think this is exactly the [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2790.7999999999997s)]
*  right step and you know i really salute Elon for having done sort of led the way in a bunch of [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2795.9199999999996s)]
*  areas including you know having the grok language models you know allow you to interact with them [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2802.8799999999997s)]
*  in some ways that the big companies never would so and you know those things we may consider sort [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2809.68s)]
*  of banal like the the uh the like adult sexy chat features of grok but he's he's been pushing the [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2815.12s)]
*  edges and i think he's going to do the same thing with reasoning models and this is an example of [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2821.7599999999998s)]
*  that. Dave, your thoughts? Well truth is definitely in the eye of the beholder and [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2825.92s)]
*  varies by country and we learned that in Saudi this week in a big way so [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2831.84s)]
*  the message is right on target but then the definition and the implementation just there's [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2836.56s)]
*  no single answer to it and like Anish said earlier in the podcast the the LLMs that we're using [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2840.56s)]
*  transformer based are very good at interpolation not quite as good at extrapolation so it's going [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2846.48s)]
*  to fill in the blind spots between the training data that you give it and don't give it [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2851.84s)]
*  i love the message of give it you know first principles physics but i think everyone's going [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2855.52s)]
*  to do that it's not controversial about physics it's when you start including some x data and [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2860.08s)]
*  not other x data or do you include all x data that's where the you know the devil's in the [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2866.08s)]
*  details i'd be very curious to know though you know is Elon going to roll out versions [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2871.04s)]
*  and or is there just one grok you know because then you then you're like okay grok has this [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2876.4s)]
*  opinion of the world gemini has this other opinion chat gbt has this other opinion or are there 20 [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2880.16s)]
*  grocs 20 gp and you tune them so you know tbd yeah so i mean the the biggest challenge we've [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2886.96s)]
*  had even in the social media space is echo chambers and so the question becomes are you [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2893.52s)]
*  able to take rock 3.5 and build your own echo chamber or will it say peter i'm sorry your point [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2899.2s)]
*  of view is absolutely wrong and here's the data about why it's wrong is it going to challenge us [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2906.08s)]
*  in that way i mean uh you know you elon is pushing boundaries all the time um and will [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2910.48s)]
*  will grok call him or president trump or biden or anybody else on things that they say which is uh [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2919.12s)]
*  which are uh not defendable by specific evidence well one thing i think about a lot and this is [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2925.68s)]
*  right in anish's wheelhouse is how much can the can the user control and especially when it comes [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2932.8s)]
*  to copyrighted material because a lot of the most interesting and fun things you can do as a user [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2938.7200000000003s)]
*  involve copyrighted material but the the foundation model companies are under a lot of scrutiny and [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2942.48s)]
*  they have to be very very very careful with copyright material but if you put it in the [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2947.2000000000003s)]
*  hands of the user to decide what they want to create what they want to do what voice they want [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2950.88s)]
*  on it then it's outside of the control of grok and and then you can start using copyrighted material [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2955.92s)]
*  it means easier for me to it's easier for me to steal it than for google or open ai to steal it [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2962.4s)]
*  yeah yeah okay yeah i mean i think we have to be careful not to have a zero-sum conversation about [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2969.12s)]
*  that though david actually if you look at for example sampling in hip-hop was very controversial [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2974.2400000000002s)]
*  the genre wouldn't exist without it you know i would argue that it sort of drove more royalties [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2979.28s)]
*  and traffic back to the tracks that were sampled than would have happened otherwise so i do wonder [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2983.76s)]
*  if there isn't a positive sum version of a lot of this and i would love to get you and bill [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2989.28s)]
*  gross at the same time talking about that because that's his whole focus at prorata ai you guys could [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2993.52s)]
*  go for probably an hour on that topic that would be really interesting love too so let's here's [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=2998.4s)]
*  our next article xai deploys 170 tesla megapacks for colossus 2 the power backbone and we can see [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3004.5600000000004s)]
*  in this image all those those power packs i mean what we're seeing is just an extraordinary building [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3012.4s)]
*  race faster than ever before and i was just reading some articles that you know regulation [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3018.4s)]
*  of gaining access to power or building permits had been the constraint but perhaps not now perhaps [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3025.04s)]
*  people taking the constraints off regulation building permits and so forth any comments on [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3032.32s)]
*  on colossus 2 i mean how how big do is it going to be do we know how many gpus will be [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3037.92s)]
*  yeah i think it was 200 000 in the next wave mostly h100 the b100s are not ready yet i thought [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3044.08s)]
*  i thought the first colossus was upgrading to 200 000 and maybe colossus 2 is going to be a million [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3050.56s)]
*  but you know what's the order of magnitude between friends [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3055.04s)]
*  yeah no i was talking about the prior iteration so this is what they're planning in the [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3059.4399999999996s)]
*  in the next iteration in the next iteration yeah well we'll see i don't know but i know the b100s [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3063.04s)]
*  are not in volume yet so you're still using the prior iteration what's amazing about this is [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3068.96s)]
*  you know eon is immensely practical and the reason the the tesla packs are so important is because [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3074.7200000000003s)]
*  when you when you use nvidia chips for these massive scale single training runs the power [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3082.2400000000002s)]
*  spikes like crazy because it it does these huge all collect all distribute operations that just [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3086.4s)]
*  you know are massively communications intensive and so then the gpu is kind of idle while they're [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3091.76s)]
*  waiting to transfer data and the power drops like crazy and it's fluctuating all over the place you [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3097.44s)]
*  can't you can't use lithium to store anywhere near enough energy to power these things but you can [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3102.88s)]
*  use it to smooth out the the power flow so that's that's a pretty big advantage for uh for elon i [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3108.48s)]
*  found this next article on nvidia's breakthroughs it's so let me read this out loud one spine of [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3115.04s)]
*  nvidia's nv link fusion can transfer more data than the internet holy shit that's incredible [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3122.4s)]
*  130 terabytes per second connects uh you know it was a gb200 chips the next generation ships [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3129.76s)]
*  across 5 000 coaxial cables connected to 72 gpus peak traffic of the entire internet internet was [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3137.92s)]
*  900 terabytes terabits per second so the spine transfers 16 more data than the entire internet [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3145.84s)]
*  let's take a listen to the jensen speak about this and so this is the nv link spine two miles [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3151.84s)]
*  of cables 5 000 cables structured all coaxed it and peens matched and it connects all 72 gpus to [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3160.08s)]
*  all of the other 72 gpus across this network called nv link switch 130 terabytes per second [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3173.44s)]
*  of bandwidth across the nv link spine so just put in perspective the peak traffic of the entire [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3182.0s)]
*  internet the peak traffic of the entire internet is 900 terabytes per second this [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3191.92s)]
*  moves more traffic than the entire internet wow um i just feel to you like we're building [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3204.88s)]
*  some version of skynet right now well when i call it star gated it's like you know all these things [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3213.1200000000003s)]
*  the terminology lines up i completely don't understand a single word of this [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3220.48s)]
*  oh wow like what is a spine of what so it's the interconnect it's so when one of the things that [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3225.36s)]
*  elon did when he built colossus the first version right was he was able to basically co-locate all [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3233.6s)]
*  the gpus and effectively for lack of a better term harmonize them to get them all talking to each [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3240.48s)]
*  other and this at least from my point of view is that the capability to do that within a full nvidia [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3246.72s)]
*  system anisha what do you think about this yeah i mean to me it actually illustrates something [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3256.8799999999997s)]
*  more mundane which is so much of the work that we need to do is actually engineering work [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3261.52s)]
*  you know it's of course there's work at the edge and research but there's just so much raw [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3266.3999999999996s)]
*  engineering work that needs to be done to make these systems operate at scale and a lot of [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3270.16s)]
*  the sort of constraints that we're going to see are going to be engineering related and also a [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3274.88s)]
*  lot of the upside if you look at deep seek the reason it was so cheap to train supposedly is a [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3278.6400000000003s)]
*  lot of it was just really clever engineering techniques so there's a lot of upside in in the [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3283.84s)]
*  day-to-day engineering work as well that's what i see yeah and all of this stuff is happening [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3287.44s)]
*  contemporarily which is what makes it so exciting to be here right now you know really uh well [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3292.2400000000002s)]
*  daniela roose and i were touring one of the biggest deployments actually it's the biggest [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3299.12s)]
*  b100 deployment uh so daniela runs c-sail at mit biggest ai lab in the world and we were touring [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3302.88s)]
*  it together and the the chips are all liquid cooled down which means those racks are dead silent and [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3308.96s)]
*  i was expecting this really eerie awesome silent experience but the interconnect spine is still air [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3313.44s)]
*  cooled and it sounds like a jet engine and so it's right next it takes all kind of the magic [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3319.04s)]
*  what really surprised me though is that the the gpus are all in a rack six million dollars a column [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3323.92s)]
*  and then the interconnect is physically a rack over i would have expected it to need to be much [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3330.64s)]
*  closer together to get optimal performance but it's actually you know physically separated into [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3336.48s)]
*  separate columns for some reason that really surprised me but it's an incredible tour to take [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3342.08s)]
*  you should definitely throw it on the to-do list use your your a16z all access card to anything [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3346.72s)]
*  that's right anish do you want to walk us through uh google i.o is happening right now [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3352.48s)]
*  um it's exciting yeah please yeah i oh please yeah take you know take take it away on this [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3358.8799999999997s)]
*  slide tell us about it no no i mean it's so interesting i've only had a chance to try a few [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3364.3199999999997s)]
*  of the products so far i tried the ai mode you know i was a little bit overwhelmed uh sorry [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3368.0s)]
*  underwhelmed um you know like what stands out to me and is notable number one i think vio their [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3373.52s)]
*  video models video generation models are incredible vio is probably the only video model that has been [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3380.3199999999997s)]
*  competitive with the chinese models which are less constrained on copyrighted training data let's [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3386.88s)]
*  say so i think google has actually shown real strength and in video generation so that's one [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3392.0s)]
*  thing that i'm interested in spending more time with the second is the price point that we discussed [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3397.6s)]
*  earlier 250 a month you know has google ever had a consumer product that's priced this way we've [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3401.44s)]
*  even seen many and it's extraordinary that they think that they can command these prices and i [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3406.88s)]
*  think they will i do think that their you know ai mode felt to me a bit like a watered down [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3411.2s)]
*  perplexity it's just not that good and and it really shows the power of counter positioning [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3416.3199999999997s)]
*  because google has spent 20 years making commitments to an ads ecosystem you know and all the blue links [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3421.6s)]
*  and everything else that now you know this sort of competitive setup is demanding that they break [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3427.2s)]
*  very difficult for them to break those commitments and i think it's a real threat to their search [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3433.2s)]
*  monopoly yeah i'd love to follow up on that you know i noticed the stock went down pretty [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3436.56s)]
*  significantly during this which is really unusual during this kind of a of an event but i think it's [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3441.6s)]
*  for exactly the reason you were saying the cooler this is and the more search moves over to it the [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3447.2s)]
*  more it cannibalizes the core correct that's exactly right it's it's such a challenging [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3453.52s)]
*  position for them to be in and look the front door of the internet they have been the front door of [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3457.84s)]
*  the internet for the last 20 years it's the most interesting place to be on the internet from an [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3461.84s)]
*  economic perspective the front door to the internet is up for grabs already my kids are telling me [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3466.48s)]
*  dad everybody knows that chat gbt is better than google so there's a near-term threat from products [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3471.2s)]
*  and then there's a sort of long-term threat from generational change in the products that they [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3476.4s)]
*  prefer to consume yeah and the fact of the matter is there will be something that will come along [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3479.92s)]
*  and bypass open ai and google and everything else and we haven't haven't met the founder yet haven't [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3486.88s)]
*  heard what it's called but that's just the reality it's i'll never forget when jeff bezos got at a [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3492.88s)]
*  at a it was an all-hands meeting and he said in 30 years amazon may not exist anymore [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3499.6s)]
*  which is pretty extraordinary so selim i think i think those are those wire those sirens happening [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3505.84s)]
*  in new jersey that they're here that's a niche i think in san francisco the mean streets of san [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3512.4s)]
*  francisco for me the one that the one that struck me for this was the 3d video communications google [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3518.56s)]
*  beam that's the one i'm really looking forward to i think it'll be really well we had that we had [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3524.24s)]
*  that at at at button 360 this year that's right and they're consumed i think that would be amazing [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3529.12s)]
*  yeah it really it really does make a huge difference in your experience you feel like [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3535.92s)]
*  you're sitting across from the person i remember when cisco had their giant version that cost like [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3540.0s)]
*  a couple hundred thousand dollars per set side of the setup and now google beam i didn't actually [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3546.56s)]
*  know they're going to call it beam that's great i mean it's me a consumer product and then project [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3552.96s)]
*  aura right there are smart glasses i think is going to be with full gemini integration [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3558.64s)]
*  is going to be great we're i think we'll probably start to see ar wearables on the street [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3565.84s)]
*  um remember the first time we started seeing people wearing uh air pods air pods yeah and [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3574.08s)]
*  people people on the street talking to themselves well we're going to start to see uh like these [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3581.28s)]
*  these uh smart glasses as well um can't wait i mean for me it's the it's the future of education [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3588.0s)]
*  as well uh let's move on here okay so here's what we said a little bit earlier uh it really [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3595.1200000000003s)]
*  drives me nuts that apple still cannot spell my wife's name or my name properly when i dictate it [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3602.64s)]
*  i mean it's it's embarrassing so why apple still hasn't cracked ai this is an article that came out [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3609.68s)]
*  let me just read this real quick siri overhaul delayed repeatedly new features failed internal [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3615.8399999999997s)]
*  tests and missed 24 and 2025 rollout goals apple spent billions on ai chips and startups but [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3621.12s)]
*  internal disagreements on budget allocations led to lack of gpu supplies seven years after hiring [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3628.3199999999997s)]
*  ex-google ai chief john gandre apple is still lagging in ai versus its competitors i mean this [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3634.24s)]
*  is so sad i mean this could be a wound that truly damages apple significantly if someone had a [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3643.12s)]
*  beautiful high-end phone with full ai integration this could be up for grabs and [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3652.0s)]
*  yeah um yeah so i'm fully impregnated high level theory on this but before [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3662.0s)]
*  anish do you see in the valley truly great people going to apple to work [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3667.44s)]
*  i mean apple it has a very sort of specific it's slightly insular culture so less people come [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3675.52s)]
*  in and out of apple in my experience and come in and out of places like google and meta um i look [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3681.84s)]
*  i read this article due to i think that they have a real challenge as a consumer using siri every [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3687.28s)]
*  day is like a stick in the eye i think they have a cultural problem because i really think that the [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3692.7200000000003s)]
*  you know ai has as we talked about earlier sort of disagreement sexuality you know persuasion all [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3698.56s)]
*  of these aspects of the human experience that apple has tries to sort of polish away and then [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3703.6800000000003s)]
*  finally i think they've not had a great track record of partnering they really do want to [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3709.12s)]
*  build everything and that's served them well but you know the models are moving too quickly and [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3714.08s)]
*  it's not a core capability of their technology team today so i think they're in a pretty tough [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3718.0s)]
*  position with that said fixing things like voice translation in siri like come on it's just a daily [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3722.4s)]
*  reminder that they can't do ai it's crazy so here's here's my high level observation i'd love to get [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3728.48s)]
*  your thoughts on it the visionary integrator model so eric schmidt good friend of of peter [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3736.0s)]
*  he talked when you guys were on stage um you know in the side-by-side chairs he talked for maybe 20 [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3741.84s)]
*  minutes on the visionary integrator model and eric called this story about he you know he was walking [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3746.96s)]
*  through the streets of silicon valley with serguei and larry and serguei said eric that building [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3751.76s)]
*  right there we need that building and eric said we don't we don't need that building serguei and [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3757.36s)]
*  and serguei said yes we do and he said okay well you're the visionary if you say we need that [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3763.7599999999998s)]
*  building then we'll make it work we need that building and he made it work and that that defined [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3767.52s)]
*  what is now the visionary integrator model that elon musk's perfected you know he's he's got so [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3772.48s)]
*  much vision but he needs a perfect can finish my sentences integrator for every business every [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3777.36s)]
*  operation so it's really obvious that that steve jobs was the visionary tim cook was the integrator [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3783.68s)]
*  for years but now if i go to google trends and i see how many searches are on steve jobs name [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3789.76s)]
*  versus tim cook's name versus elon musk's name it's 102 for steve jobs one for tim cook so here [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3795.44s)]
*  14 years after steve jobs has passed away still twice as many people are searching his name as [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3802.8s)]
*  tim cook's name meanwhile in saudi this week tim's not there all the visionaries are there [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3808.2400000000002s)]
*  so then you're like well who is the visionary who's the integrator in the company because [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3815.1200000000003s)]
*  the visionary needs to attract talent which means you need to be on this podcast or in saudi arabia [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3819.36s)]
*  or on all in or whatever it is that in that era gets people inspired to come and work for your [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3826.1600000000003s)]
*  company that's a huge part of the visionary job and i don't see that dynamic and you i'd love to [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3832.32s)]
*  get google throw google in that same bucket you know we're just talking about google's you know [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3838.4s)]
*  kind of a little underwhelming i.o. but if you can't name the visionary and the integrator then [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3843.52s)]
*  you're not following the known to work current model yeah and and having a company that is [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3849.2000000000003s)]
*  founder-led where the founder can basically say i don't care what the board says or what [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3855.6s)]
*  you know everybody else says this is where we have to go or it's an ai first founder-led company [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3862.8s)]
*  are going to eat the lunch of everybody else especially at scale you need the founder-led [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3869.68s)]
*  model just to cut through all the bureaucracy otherwise you end up in in terminal political [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3874.3999999999996s)]
*  fights and i think it's done which is what we're seeing and i've had a few friends who sold it in [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3878.7999999999997s)]
*  the apple list of choices but yeah i think that uh there's got to be a still a solution that creates [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3883.04s)]
*  a visionary role even though you can't obviously go back to the founder yeah and uh i've had friends [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3890.64s)]
*  of mine who had the chance to sell their company to google or apple and i'm like if you go to apple [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3896.48s)]
*  you'll be swallowed up into a giant nda not be able to talk to anybody not be able to go and speak [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3902.48s)]

*  to join you in the garden for that bottle of wine next time that is one closing thought i love having [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3931.7599999999998s)]
*  these conversations i do feel like this is the most human technology that we've ever invented [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3936.16s)]
*  and i do think as you as you talk peter about making the transition from a mindset of fear and [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3942.08s)]
*  scarcity to one of abundance this is exactly the technology that unlocks that in a very tangible [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3946.32s)]
*  way so you know i there i wouldn't trade being alive now for any other time in history it truly [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3950.8s)]
*  is the most extraordinary time ever to be alive i want to i just acknowledge something in each [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3957.2000000000003s)]
*  time insight you had at the beginning about the subjective technologies and how much of a [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3961.04s)]
*  difference i don't make that's the first time i've seen somebody clearly articulate the massive [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3965.1200000000003s)]
*  opportunity yet so much appreciated thank you the analogy to the jones act too is uh something i've [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3970.2400000000002s)]
*  never heard before so we're gonna borg like assimilate all of this please do dave if i [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3975.52s)]
*  look forward to hearing it just as i adopted abundance from peter you guys have got license [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3980.24s)]
*  to use those now nice to be with you thank you for having me guys a pleasure anish thank you [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3984.32s)]
*  bye bye cheers every day i get the strangest compliment someone will stop me and say peter [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3989.12s)]
*  you have such nice skin honestly i never thought i'd hear that from anyone and honestly i can't [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3994.16s)]
*  take the full credit all i do is use something called one skin os1 twice a day every day the [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=3999.76s)]
*  company is built by four brilliant phd women who identified a peptide that effectively reverses the [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4006.0800000000004s)]
*  age of your skin i love it and again i use this twice a day every day you can go to one skin [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4012.0800000000004s)]
*  dot co and write peter at checkout for a discount on the same product i use that's one skin dot co [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4018.4s)]
*  and use the code peter at checkout all right back to the episode all right who really enjoyed having [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4024.96s)]
*  an ishan i found this article somewhat interesting it's a speculative scenario a history of the [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4030.88s)]
*  future 2025 to 2040 but it brings up a lot of great plans i'd love to hear your guys [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4039.28s)]
*  thoughts on let's take it uh one at a time so 2025 to 2026 the year ahead it's the agentic ai boom [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4044.96s)]
*  so gpt05 is multimodal it's coming out quad 4 uh cogen floods uh apps uh so i think this is [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4054.0s)]
*  happening it's not really a prediction it's just uh reporting on what's going on it's going to 2027 [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4064.8s)]
*  to 2028 but for this one hold on one second i think the agentic is going to give way to vertical [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4070.16s)]
*  because there's so much opportunity in training vertical ai's on very specific use cases i think [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4076.08s)]
*  that's going to complement the agentic but but in general the paradigm is right yeah my prediction [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4082.16s)]
*  the the word agentic is going to get old very quickly it's just too vague and generic what was [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4087.8399999999997s)]
*  the word that got old very quickly like a couple of years ago there was something uh co-pilot as [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4093.44s)]
*  a term everybody started using co-pilot as a generic term yeah yeah and that got so annoying [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4098.72s)]
*  so fast yeah it did i think vibe coding is going to come and go real fast too uh not it's a great [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4104.88s)]
*  term actually i'll be sad to see it go but um what you saw with codecs you can launch you know [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4110.8s)]
*  20 concurrent processes and then stitch them back together again and that's that's very different [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4116.8s)]
*  from vibe coding no one's named that yet and greg brockman when he rolled it out said yeah i'm so [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4121.4400000000005s)]
*  bad at naming things we're just going to call this codecs like what i know i was like huh [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4126.400000000001s)]
*  didn't you just didn't you call it codecs already like years ago um so uh 2027 2028 uh we're going [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4132.080000000001s)]
*  to see breakthroughs uh i think one of the things that's interesting is it's predicted that in the [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4140.160000000001s)]
*  next couple years we're going to start to see physics breakthroughs and mathematical breakthroughs [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4147.120000000001s)]
*  and we're going to start to see fundamental uh technology moving forward and its ability to [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4151.68s)]
*  help us understand the universe even even deeper i find that that for me is the biggest and most [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4157.36s)]
*  exciting thing because i think there's so much research data that we have not seen the signal [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4163.679999999999s)]
*  from noise and i've not extracted key observations from i think ai let loose on that will absolutely [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4167.759999999999s)]
*  do magical things yeah 2029 to 2031 the end of white collar work uh i believe that you know and [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4173.5199999999995s)]
*  this is an argument i have with a lot of people uh what will it not be able to do uh i don't see [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4183.04s)]
*  any job that you know that at this point we're talking about advanced super intelligence [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4192.32s)]
*  do you do you think this is true that we're going to start to see the end of all white [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4201.36s)]
*  collar work by that point the thing that's driving me nuts about this is that that that's the end [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4204.88s)]
*  point you know figure 2030 is the end point but it's pretty much a straight line between here and [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4210.96s)]
*  there and so the amount of job dislocation you know in 2026 2027 is going to be like nothing we've [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4216.8s)]
*  ever seen and i keep telling all the ceos you're way under planning you need to look at every [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4224.4800000000005s)]
*  single person in your organization all the individual contributors doing white collar work [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4231.92s)]
*  and you need to get them to become ai users right now otherwise you're condemning them [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4236.56s)]
*  to being sitting ducks and you're like well it's two or three years in the future two or they've [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4243.76s)]
*  been working and doing their career planning for 20 years yeah they're stuck like yeah you've got to [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4248.8s)]
*  get them on the platform now and free up the time for them to learn and put you know formal education [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4253.92s)]
*  programs in front of them now because if you draw a straight line between now and 2030 which is [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4260.96s)]
*  probably more like 2029 2028 that's only a couple years for people to remap their entire career path [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4267.12s)]
*  this service by sticking your head in the sand and ignoring this there's another thing as well [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4274.24s)]
*  which is getting your employees and your kids and your friends to start thinking as entrepreneurs [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4279.2s)]
*  right because it would i was having a conversation with a friend of mine dan solomon and dan [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4286.96s)]
*  i was saying you know you know as this technology starts to truly become uh you know magical level [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4291.36s)]
*  and we can't even imagine right now um is it going to quench my sense of purpose is it going to [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4298.719999999999s)]
*  uh you know start solving things for me to the point where i'm not motivated and and dan said [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4307.12s)]
*  uh has there ever been a time where more powerful technology has made you less motivated [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4313.76s)]
*  and i said no and he says why do you think that is and i said because i'm an entrepreneur [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4318.88s)]
*  and i just dream bigger every time there's there's more capabilities handed to me [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4323.599999999999s)]
*  and i think that mindset of finding problems solving problems and letting everybody know [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4328.16s)]
*  they can become entrepreneurs they can start to create uh you know new capabilities new companies [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4335.36s)]
*  new nonprofits they can start to dream at a level like never before is is an unleashing of the human [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4342.56s)]
*  spirit that is so important and creativity to boot it will force it which i think is really amazing [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4348.080000000001s)]
*  well i was when i was lecturing at stanford two weeks ago um at the end of the lecture the ta came [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4354.88s)]
*  up to me and said man you really won the hearts and minds of all these students when you said [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4360.400000000001s)]
*  the administration is completely out of touch with you it's like really that's what got them [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4364.400000000001s)]
*  went over but it's that dynamic where you know your kids are going through my kids are going [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4368.96s)]
*  through where they're chomping at the bit to use ai because it's so empowering and because the [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4373.44s)]
*  administration hasn't figured anything out yet and they're woefully behind they're a barrier [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4379.28s)]
*  but the corporate version of that is well we can't do this because we're regulated [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4384.88s)]
*  or because of data leaks or because of hallucinations that's a bullshit excuse it means [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4390.24s)]
*  you haven't figured it out at the exec staff level and now you're condemning your people [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4396.48s)]
*  to being behind the curve and to great observation and yeah it's just so it's a leadership failure [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4401.2s)]
*  yep it's absolutely a leadership failure it's inexcusable the last quadrant in this slide here [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4407.44s)]
*  is 2036 to 2035 or 2035 2036 um and it's trillion robot economy i think it's supposed to be 2036 [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4412.5599999999995s)]
*  to 2045 i think it's just a trillion dollar yeah and so it's the notion that we're about to have [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4422.96s)]
*  a massive explosion a number of robots and it's not just humanoid robots it's robots of every shape [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4429.12s)]
*  and size at the same time that we have bio longevity cures we unleash human longevity you [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4435.12s)]
*  know love that stuff let's move on here along the lines of what we just saw here's an article i [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4444.08s)]
*  pulled in ai designs antibiotic uh synthesis that beats uh mercer in mice so this is multi [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4450.32s)]
*  antibiotic resistant strains of uh of of bacteria uh and so researchers built an ai tool that designs [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4458.5599999999995s)]
*  new antibiotic molecules faster than traditional methods and ai designed antibiotics effectively [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4466.48s)]
*  treating mercer infections that no longer respond to existing drugs ai can design affordable lab [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4472.719999999999s)]
*  ready antibiotics to fight the deadliest infections this is the stuff that turns me on this is the [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4478.4s)]
*  stuff that i'm just thrilled about our future well that and once you can personalize it to [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4483.5199999999995s)]
*  the individual which will be able to do as a very quick next step everything changes at that point [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4488.799999999999s)]
*  yeah for sure all right uh one of our last slides here is that gemini 2.5 benchmarks [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4494.799999999999s)]
*  outperform competitors yet again in mathematics and coding and multimodal we're seeing gemini 2.5 [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4502.56s)]
*  pro really beat out against uh open ai uh both 03 and 04 model and what it's not doing though [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4509.200000000001s)]
*  is it's not winning the revenue race you know open ai is just trouncing uh google in in revenues [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4517.360000000001s)]
*  and that's a dangerous place for it to be i don't know if we need to say anything else about this [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4524.88s)]
*  but it's google's got incredible engineering talent and you know a massive number of [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4529.36s)]
*  wet squishy brains working on this stuff all right let's go into uh beyond ai in the robotics world [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4538.32s)]
*  uh robotaxis and this comes from our from unusual whales so arc invest this is kathy wood projects [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4547.5199999999995s)]
*  of 34 trillion dollar enterprise value from robotaxis by 2030 so uh you know kathy has been [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4555.84s)]
*  long on tesla uh as i am here we see a few of the companies uh this is waymo and soon uh cyber cab [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4563.28s)]
*  that's massive i mean the idea that people are going to not take their cars anymore i think when [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4575.6s)]
*  this really works uh dave and salim is when my ai is automatically anticipating when i need a car [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4580.88s)]
*  and the car is showing up without me having to take it right it knows my calendar it sees me [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4589.28s)]
*  walking towards the front door and the car is just waiting for me it's magical well for god's sakes [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4595.84s)]
*  when can it drive our kids to practice you know that can't come soon enough uh well even within [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4601.28s)]
*  two three years so there you go you've been waiting a lifetime two or three years you're [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4609.12s)]
*  you'll be on i think we're supposed to have cyber to do the math for us thank god um it just it's [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4613.68s)]
*  easy to lose track of the fact that a huge fraction of humanity you know the number one [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4620.48s)]
*  uh job in the world is driver that's the number one title but you know then you look down the [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4626.08s)]
*  long tail of other things that people do and just a huge fraction of humanity is doing [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4631.12s)]
*  things as routine as driver or you know screw circuit board in or assemble laptop lid or [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4635.76s)]
*  it just goes on and on and on and so if you sample humanity we you lose track of that when [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4643.36s)]
*  you're in a high tech hub and everybody's working on next-gen stuff and spaceships and ai but just [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4647.68s)]
*  sample you know random person on the planet and what they do and that's in the scale of of it you [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4653.2s)]
*  know comes out to 33 trillion i guess uh she would do the math it is what it is well here's an example [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4658.48s)]
*  so we know outpaces lift in san francisco 300 waymo vehicles now uh now compete complete more [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4664.08s)]
*  rides than 45 000 lift drivers in san francisco and uh each waymo averages the workload of 150 [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4671.92s)]
*  human drivers operating 24 seven uh have you guys taken away my ride yet oh yeah yeah so anyone in [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4680.0s)]
*  phoenix it was pretty mind-boggling and that was like ages ago so it's gotten way way better since [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4687.04s)]
*  it has and you don't need to tip your driver you know you can have confidential conversations [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4692.8s)]
*  you know i'm always wondering if my driver is listening to my conversation as i'm just [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4698.88s)]
*  you know in the heat of discussion listening i mean you know i had a back-to-back where i did [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4702.56s)]
*  a waymo ride in san francisco the next day i was in new york and i was in a you know smelly yellow [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4707.92s)]
*  cab and it was like but the thing that jumped out of me about the waymo that i completely [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4711.68s)]
*  overlooked is you can control the lighting and the music and they'll keep adding things to it [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4716.8s)]
*  so it becomes like your your little you know travel cabana and you know we'll add flat screen [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4721.84s)]
*  tvs it'll sync to your phone and it's going to be just such a different experience it's not just [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4727.4400000000005s)]
*  about being driven it's it's about control of your environment so i hadn't anticipated that [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4732.24s)]
*  yeah i can't wait for the lie down beds so i can like you know get a nap on my way to work [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4738.24s)]
*  uh this was a fun article out of wall street journal apple does support brain implant control [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4744.08s)]
*  of its devices it's teaming up with synchron to bring brain computer interface to consume [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4749.5199999999995s)]
*  to consumer devices now albeit this is specifically for people who are impaired [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4756.96s)]
*  who have severe disabilities but uh you know this is the direction we're heading again [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4763.04s)]
*  we're heading again ray's predicted bci our ability to connect everything to the neocortex [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4768.72s)]
*  in the early 2030s i just love seeing these little hints towards that direction yeah these [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4775.84s)]
*  are the early signals around that but it'll become mainstream pretty quick after this [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4781.84s)]
*  well i'm very much a humanist i think it's kind of it gets really creepy to me when you start [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4786.64s)]
*  punching directly into your neurons but i'll put that aside for a second ray is going to emerge [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4791.12s)]
*  as one of the greatest prognosticators in the history of the world after going you know up [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4797.6s)]
*  and then way down and then 2029 artificial super intelligence predicted 30 years ago [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4804.160000000001s)]
*  it's going to land like on the exact moment it's super annoying because he's so outrageous but [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4810.240000000001s)]
*  always correct drives everybody crazy it's funny i don't know him you know you guys know him [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4818.080000000001s)]
*  personally very well i don't know him personally but the books were so inspiring to me i mean just [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4823.04s)]
*  reinforcing everything i was already thinking but then really quantifying it so i just i'm going to [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4828.08s)]
*  love that that when it lands right on them on the minute um yeah it'll be great for singularity as a [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4832.72s)]
*  brand too i think yeah all right let's close out our conversation today on uh on moonshots with a [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4839.12s)]
*  look at crypto once again here we go we're seeing us enacts stablecoin bill in 2025 so prediction [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4846.400000000001s)]
*  market polymarket shows a 95 probability the us will pass a stablecoin bill in 2025 up 35 [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4855.76s)]
*  from prior weeks any comments on this selim i think this is going to be huge they have to first pass [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4864.8s)]
*  a budget so let's give them some time to figure that out but when they figure out the stable coins [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4871.68s)]
*  this will completely unleash the crypto world and and and give it a bridge from the crypto economy [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4877.200000000001s)]
*  into the real world economy and i think all sorts of things become possible i think the opportunity [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4882.8s)]
*  for ai agents to do microtransactions using this is going to be amazing so huge options yeah i think [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4889.12s)]
*  that last point is by far the most important one that we should track closely week to week because [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4895.92s)]
*  the ability to move back and forth uh instantaneously digitally from a stablecoin [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4900.48s)]
*  back to bitcoin or whatever you want is intimately tied to the agent to agent [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4905.04s)]
*  microtransactions and you know that that's going to be i get kathy wood to do the math for us but [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4910.08s)]
*  that's going to be probably the biggest part of the economy by 2040 is those transactions oh yeah [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4916.32s)]
*  there will be there will be probably hundreds of billions of agents each doing microtransactions i [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4920.8s)]
*  mean this is this is the half of the internet you know the internet when it was built uh you [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4927.2s)]
*  allow us to share imagery and data and documents but not financial transactions this is the other [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4932.8s)]
*  half of the equation and it's coming fast we're playing with codecs you know pretty much all [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4940.72s)]
*  weekend um you can spawn agents to do all kinds of things for you and the interface they put on [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4946.0s)]
*  front of it you know each time you spawn an agent it creates a new row and there's a little [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4953.2s)]
*  bar turning you're like this interface like right out of the gate i want to do a thousand agents [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4958.32s)]
*  like and then it's going to be a million agents and and it's immediately obvious that we're all [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4963.04s)]
*  going to be fighting for inference time compute like you can think of things so fast and and [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4968.72s)]
*  deploy so many agents to do them for you so quickly you know like the the gating factor is well i can't [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4973.599999999999s)]
*  get the compute and this interface obviously is not going to support the scale that i need either [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4978.88s)]
*  well the thing that anish said as well is having his agent going out and shopping for lower cost [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4982.88s)]
*  insurance or mortgage rates and such so i love that idea you're going to be able to optimize [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4989.04s)]
*  everything you're going to have your agents constantly searching the web at minimal cost [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=4997.04s)]
*  and then i want an army of agents that are going out and making investment trades for me going out [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=5003.92s)]
*  there and just an army making money you know you know for me i've been waiting for my boys my two [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=5009.52s)]
*  boys to actually get excited about trading crypto but i think the agents will get there first [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=5014.88s)]
*  well you know another topic i wish we had more time with anish to talk about it because i know [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=5020.72s)]
*  he's big on disposable code and personalized code and like well what's an example of that well [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=5024.64s)]
*  the example anish usually gives is imagine you're using suino or udo to create a song but the song [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=5032.8s)]
*  is about this exact podcast and it has you know content in it that's related to our topics today [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=5037.76s)]
*  that's a great theme song to play as a pre-roll so it's the software created this this thing [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=5043.2s)]
*  specifically for the podcast it uses a fair amount of compute but still like 12 cents no big deal you [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=5047.360000000001s)]
*  create it then you throw it away well i can think of a lot of those things let me spawn all those [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=5053.04s)]
*  agents to create them and i'm going to throw them away when they're done that's a lot of compute [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=5058.08s)]
*  it's so worth it but where's all that compute going to come from well my last slide for today [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=5062.32s)]
*  still on the bitcoin role at this moment bitcoin is running at 106 000 roughly 500 [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=5069.360000000001s)]
*  dollars pretty good it's we're approaching near highs and this article came out bitcoin has [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=5075.360000000001s)]
*  become america's reserve asset more americans own bitcoin than gold that's pretty extraordinary [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=5082.88s)]
*  i think this is kind of predictable just because it's so much more democratized it's so much [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=5090.4s)]
*  a thousand times easier to own bitcoin than it is to own gold so i would have expected to see this [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=5094.96s)]
*  sooner the thing that i think will be coming really powerful is when we have people owning [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=5100.4s)]
*  a gross level more bitcoin than they do a gross level of gold i think that'll be amazing yeah [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=5105.36s)]
*  pleasure as always gentlemen onwards this was a big week in ai we have one last thing peter [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=5111.36s)]
*  what's that well the the there i think dave you have a slide or a photograph right do you [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=5118.0s)]
*  want to just show that i'll stop sharing can the team pull it up for me yeah or i can i can show [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=5124.64s)]
*  something if you have it then i'm given that it's your birthday peter we found an m.i.t. photograph [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=5132.88s)]
*  of you from from a ways back we thought this was absolutely worth showing so talk talk about [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=5138.56s)]
*  ai agents and retro we want to hear that guy's voice yeah i get this from uh from matt rita he [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=5147.04s)]
*  sent me with an emoji of a hair pick along with it so i didn't include that but i was really [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=5154.0s)]
*  reluctant to drag it out of the archives because i know it can come back around it's quite all right [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=5158.88s)]
*  i want to show you one other thing though hold on hold on i want to show you one other thing [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=5164.56s)]

*  have taken it every week i track the major tech meta trends these are massive game-changing shifts [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGnTgkw0kA&t=5291.679999999999s)]
