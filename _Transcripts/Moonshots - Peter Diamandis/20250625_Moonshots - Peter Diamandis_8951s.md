# Harvard Prof Reveals Age-Reversing Science to Look & Feel Younger w/ David Sinclair
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo)
*  Have we reached some state of age reversal technology that truly works? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=0.0s)]
*  We can cure diseases and injuries that have never been cured before. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5.76s)]
*  And so imagine in 10 years you just take a pill for four weeks and you get younger. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=9.72s)]
*  Why do we age? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=15.72s)]
*  The epigenome is the issue because going through sperm and egg and fertilization resets the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=18.04s)]
*  epigenome. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=23.64s)]
*  But the good news is we figured out a way to safely reset that without having to clone [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=24.64s)]
*  yourself. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=28.52s)]
*  We've gone from the idea that we just take a supplement or we do some exercise to slow [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=29.52s)]
*  down aging. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=33.56s)]
*  Now we're talking about the ability to truly reset the body, reset all of the cells in [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=34.8s)]
*  the body to be young again. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=39.28s)]
*  Teenagers today will live into the 22nd century. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  Now that's the moonshot, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=44.32s)]
*  Welcome to Moonshots, everybody. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=53.04s)]
*  This episode is delivering on a state of the union on age reversal, focusing on one [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=54.48s)]
*  of my favorite moonshots, longevity. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=60.36s)]
*  We'll be discussing epigenetic reprogramming, when we might reach longevity escape velocity, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=62.48s)]
*  and the role of AI in our longevity quest. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=68.75999999999999s)]
*  My guest here is a dear friend, a brilliant scientist, Dr. David Sinclair, professor at [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=71.84s)]
*  Harvard Medical School, author of Lifespan, one of my favorite books. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=76.8s)]
*  We'll talk about what comes next from David's authorship and one of the leading thinkers [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=80.2s)]
*  in the realm of age reversal, epigenetics and longevity science. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=86.08s)]
*  We'll discuss what's here on a near term, how you can support it, how you can be involved [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=90.48s)]
*  in it, how you can benefit from it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=95.64s)]
*  We'll also discuss why at age 55, David looks like he's 35. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  I believe we're living during the most extraordinary times in human history. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=102.68s)]
*  And if you want to see more of this future, if you want additional decades in your life, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=105.88s)]
*  this is the episode for you. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=110.38s)]
*  All right, let's jump in with Dr. David Sinclair and a whole download on the state of age reversal. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=111.83999999999999s)]
*  David, welcome, buddy. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  Hey, Peter, it's good to be back. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=120.52s)]
*  It's good to have you back. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=122.44s)]
*  How are you doing? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=123.44s)]
*  I'm doing well, you know. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=124.44s)]
*  I'm having a blast. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=126.56s)]
*  I am more focused on my health than I ever have been. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=128.32s)]
*  You're looking really good. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=131.78s)]
*  I was commenting on your biceps right now. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=133.32s)]
*  That's why I'm wearing a jacket here because I don't have them. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=135.44s)]
*  I think we can talk about this that in fact, muscle mass and exercise still remains one [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=138.51999999999998s)]
*  of the primary pro-longevity drugs out there. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=144.76s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=147.84s)]
*  And you know, we'll get into the details of what the best state of the art is and what's [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=149.23999999999998s)]
*  coming because you know, eating right, sleep, diet, all of these things can only get you [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=155.76s)]
*  so far. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=161.14s)]
*  And then the question is, can we turn back the clock of time? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=162.72s)]
*  So here's my opener for you. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=166.12s)]
*  It's 10 years from now. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=168.4s)]
*  It's 2035. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=169.96s)]
*  Have we reached some state of age reversal technology that truly works? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=171.92s)]
*  How well does it work? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=179.74s)]
*  How often are you taking this treatment and what does it cost? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=182.32s)]
*  Give me a vision of the future here. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=186.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=188.72s)]
*  Well, if I'm not asking for promises. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=189.72s)]
*  I'm asking for your best guess. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=191.92s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=193.32s)]
*  I'm not shy to talk about what I think is coming. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=194.32s)]
*  And as I wrote in my book, Lifespan, I predicted a future where we would have wearables and [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=198.6s)]
*  we would have video conferences with our doctors and you could order medicines online. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=203.0s)]
*  And I thought that was going to take 15 years and it happened in three. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=207.11999999999998s)]
*  So sometimes I'm actually, I underestimate what we're actually looking at. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=211.88s)]
*  So here's what I see. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=217.11999999999998s)]
*  I sit on the front row of the future, right? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=219.08s)]
*  For this longevity. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=222.32s)]
*  The bleeding edge, I would say. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=223.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=224.72s)]
*  And so I want to share my thoughts with the listeners. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=225.72s)]
*  What I'm seeing in my lab and labs that are competing with us or collaborating with us [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  is something quite remarkable. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=235.68s)]
*  And the pace of change is making my head spin off. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=238.8s)]
*  And I'm an optimist, but I just can't comprehend right now how fast things are going. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=241.46s)]
*  So let's just go back a few years and then we'll project into the future. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=246.96s)]
*  Going back a few years. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=250.76000000000002s)]
*  So 2017, it was just a theory that we could reverse aging. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=251.76000000000002s)]
*  Even the word reverse and still to some extent is apparent to my colleagues. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=256.04s)]
*  But we actually, we proved that and published in 2020 that you can reverse most aspects [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=261.56s)]
*  of aging by reprogramming cells, which we'll talk about. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=266.76s)]
*  And that changes everything. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=269.94s)]
*  If my information theory of aging is correct, which is, we'll talk about the idea that you [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=271.40000000000003s)]
*  don't just lose information as you get older, like software corruption, you can actually [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=277.44s)]
*  reset that. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=280.6s)]
*  If that's true and it looks like it is, then it changes everything because we've gone from [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=282.0s)]
*  the idea that, oh, we just take a supplement or we do some exercise to slow down aging. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=288.48s)]
*  That's basic. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=293.32s)]
*  That should be on everyone's protocol. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=294.4s)]
*  But now we're talking about the ability to truly reset the body, reset all of the cells [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=296.48s)]
*  in the body to be young again. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=301.2s)]
*  And not just slightly, but by 50, 75, 80, 90 percent. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=303.32s)]
*  And this isn't science fiction. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=307.44s)]
*  We do this in my lab. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=308.44s)]
*  My graduate students are doing this all the time. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=309.44s)]
*  We talk like this in my lab, whereas outside it's like, what are you talking about? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=311.48s)]
*  How do you reverse aging? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=315.24s)]
*  But what we do is we use a set of genes that are normally only on in embryos. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=316.36s)]
*  We turn them on in adult tissues, mice and monkeys, and we can cure diseases and injuries [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=320.36s)]
*  that have never been cured before, even blindness. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=327.1s)]
*  And so we published that in 2020. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=330.71999999999997s)]
*  And since then, what do we know? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=333.08s)]
*  We're at the middle of 2025 currently. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=334.56s)]
*  What I see is that with the advances of AI, and we're doing a lot of AI in my lab, which [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=339.4s)]
*  I'm happy to share, things are going so fast. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=344.84s)]
*  Now we're doing experiments in a matter of a month that would take hundreds of thousands [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=348.03999999999996s)]
*  of years to do, as you can probably imagine. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=352.06s)]
*  Trillions of molecules coming through screening virtually. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=357.24s)]
*  And so we're coming up with alternatives to this gene therapy that we published in [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=360.36s)]
*  2020. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=365.44s)]
*  So you ask me, first of all, how much might it cost? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=366.44s)]
*  Well, right now, the technology which is going into humans next year in January, hopefully. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=369.52000000000004s)]
*  This is with Life Biosciences? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=374.44s)]
*  Correct. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=375.72s)]
*  So Life Biosciences has proven that it works this reversal of aging in the optic nerve [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=376.72s)]
*  to cure a variety of ailments in the eye. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=384.2s)]
*  And we chose the eye for business reasons mainly. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=387.04s)]
*  So we're going to treat glaucoma and stroke in the eye called nion. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=391.20000000000005s)]
*  And this is a gene therapy. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=395.8s)]
*  So gene therapies typically cost $300,000, $400,000 per eye. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=396.8s)]
*  Or it could be as much as $2 million for a gene therapy, right? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=400.36s)]
*  For a rare disease. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=403.32000000000005s)]
*  It's a lot. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=405.02000000000004s)]
*  And the reason is there's a lot of hurdles to get through to get to the market. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=406.02000000000004s)]
*  And just producing this stuff is expensive, costing us more than $10 million just to make [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=410.48s)]
*  the first batch to go into humans. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=416.0s)]
*  But my lab is in existence to make this for everybody. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=418.76s)]
*  We're not here to charge as much as we can. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=424.16s)]
*  We're here to make it hopefully, eventually pennies on the dollar every time someone takes [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=426.76s)]
*  a pill. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=431.6s)]
*  So what we've been doing since the last, well, five years is to try to bring that cost down. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=432.6s)]
*  And using AI, we're now at a point where we've got molecules that really would only cost [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=439.0s)]
*  $100 to make or less for a month's course. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=444.34s)]
*  For a month's course, like three bucks a day. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=447.97999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=450.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=451.38s)]
*  And we're seeing that those work really well in mouse studies to reset an old animal's [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=452.38s)]
*  physiology within just a matter of four weeks. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=457.21999999999997s)]
*  So this holiday season, we did a hail mirror experiment. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=460.61999999999995s)]
*  We gave them just orally this cocktail. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=464.21999999999997s)]
*  And we weren't expecting anything. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=467.58s)]
*  But we thought, why don't we just measure how fit and healthy they are? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=469.65999999999997s)]
*  And all the mice that were on the treatment and not the controls ended up behaving and [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=473.34s)]
*  being physiologically younger. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=478.65999999999997s)]
*  And then when we tested their biological age, which you can do with real quantitative tests, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=480.52s)]
*  they were younger as well. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=484.94s)]
*  And that's just giving them this stuff Monday, Wednesday, Friday, for four weeks. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=485.94s)]
*  So now we want to do a lifespan study if we can raise the funds to do that and see if [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=491.41999999999996s)]
*  we can blow away the lifespan record for mice. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=495.26s)]
*  Every week I study the 10 major tech meta trends. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=499.65999999999997s)]
*  That will transform industries over the decade ahead. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=503.22s)]
*  I cover trends ranging from humanoid robots, AGI, quantum computing, transport, energy, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=505.78000000000003s)]
*  longevity and more. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=511.46000000000004s)]
*  No fluff. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=513.3000000000001s)]
*  Only the important stuff that matters, that impacts our lives and our careers. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=514.38s)]
*  If you want me to share these with you, I write a newsletter twice a week, sending it [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=518.98s)]

*  So 2035, you're saying we will have a age reversal therapeutic working. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=558.86s)]
*  Well that's where it's headed. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=568.22s)]
*  So if you extrapolate where we are, next year if all goes well, we'll have shown that you [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=569.22s)]
*  can reverse aging in a human, in a tissue, safely. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=575.42s)]
*  So curing blindness. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=578.74s)]
*  You've done this in primates already. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=579.74s)]
*  Yeah, it works in green monkeys really amazingly well. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=581.34s)]
*  And some of the data is just stunning. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=586.36s)]
*  You can map whether you reverse the age of the optic nerve in these animals. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=588.38s)]
*  And it's looking like 95% of the age goes backwards. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=593.42s)]
*  Wow. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=596.62s)]
*  I mean this is to a youthful state of the optic nerve. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=597.62s)]
*  And semi-permanently. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=600.68s)]
*  This isn't that you have to keep the genes on. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=601.68s)]
*  You can switch them off again, which we do. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=603.4s)]
*  We have an on-off system that we've patented and works really well. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=605.1s)]
*  You do it for about six to eight weeks, then turn it off and the eyes stay young. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=609.42s)]
*  They're going to age out again, but then you just turn it back on for a few weeks. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=614.66s)]
*  That's the plan. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=618.86s)]
*  That's the plan. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=619.92s)]
*  I like that plan. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=620.92s)]
*  And what type of age reversal do you see? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=622.38s)]
*  I mean putting this into human terms, someone's 50 years old, they turn this on, is it taking [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=627.02s)]
*  them back to teenage years? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=635.6s)]
*  Can you control how far back they would get? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=637.98s)]
*  Yeah, we can control it. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=640.38s)]
*  The longer you leave it on, the younger the tissue gets. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=641.96s)]
*  Beautiful. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=645.0400000000001s)]
*  And it seems very safe. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=646.0400000000001s)]
*  There's no untoward effects of this treatment so far in the monkeys either. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=647.0400000000001s)]
*  But here's what I see. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=652.46s)]
*  I see that within the next 10 years we'll have the ability to not only use gene therapy [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=653.46s)]
*  throughout the body, and we're already working at Life Biosciences on getting away from viral [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=659.1800000000001s)]
*  delivery, which is the current one. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=664.52s)]
*  And just for folks to know, gene therapy has been something developed since the 80s. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=666.36s)]
*  We ran into some troubles early on, but it's where you basically are using a virus to deliver, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=670.6s)]
*  and typically what's called an AAV, adeno-associated virus, to deliver a set of genes into targeted [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=676.88s)]
*  cells. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=682.6800000000001s)]
*  But that's expensive and sometimes maybe goes off target, you don't get all the cells you [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=683.72s)]
*  want. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=689.76s)]
*  Well, that's the big problem with AAV is that tissue distribution is tough. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=690.76s)]
*  And so we need better ways to either get those viruses evenly throughout the body or use [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=694.44s)]
*  other things like what are called lipid nanoparticles. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=700.08s)]
*  Those are also like mRNA vaccines. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=702.48s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=704.9200000000001s)]
*  Though, you know, for those that are questioning what about the vaccines, maybe they get into [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=705.9200000000001s)]
*  that part. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=710.44s)]
*  I know, vaccines got a bad name in the last course. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=711.44s)]
*  Yeah, but this is obviously not a vaccine. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=712.84s)]
*  This is you deliver genetic material inside these little particles. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=714.76s)]
*  And those, there's really good technologies actually. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=718.6s)]
*  There's a company that I'm advising called Legandal, and they use AI to find proteins [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=722.64s)]
*  that you could put on the outside of these little particles and direct them to anywhere [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=727.64s)]
*  you want them to go. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=731.18s)]
*  So getting back to what you asked me about, what does the future look like? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=732.62s)]
*  I think we can either go into the doctor and have an injection of that genetic material [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=736.08s)]
*  and we become transgenic humans that we can turn on these three youthful Yamanaka genes, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=740.8s)]
*  they're called. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=746.36s)]
*  And every time we want to get rejuvenated or we have an injury, we need to heal quickly, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=747.36s)]
*  we turn them on. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=751.72s)]
*  How do you do that? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=752.72s)]
*  Well, we've engineered it so you can just take an antibiotic for a few weeks. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=753.72s)]
*  It's doxycycline. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=756.8s)]
*  So you take a course, it's pretty safe, actually very, very safe, and you turn it on. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=757.8s)]
*  Now that's what I can see happening with all ready technology that's going into humans. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=762.12s)]
*  But if we're successful in what we're doing in my lab, these AI generated molecules are [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=767.5999999999999s)]
*  mimicking that. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=774.1999999999999s)]
*  So the reason for having a molecule rather than a gene therapy is not only are they cheap, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=775.1999999999999s)]
*  you can just swallow it and they evenly go throughout the body typically. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=779.5999999999999s)]
*  And so imagine in 10 years, you just take a pill for four weeks and you get younger. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=783.6s)]
*  That's what we're headed towards. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=788.5600000000001s)]
*  And I can see that being realistically possible in the next 10 years. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=789.5600000000001s)]
*  In fact, I can see how this is going to happen. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=793.16s)]
*  That's what we're working towards in my lab. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=795.36s)]
*  I love it. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=796.76s)]
*  I love it. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=797.76s)]
*  I can't wait. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=798.76s)]
*  And I volunteer to come first. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=799.76s)]
*  The concept of longevity escape velocity. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=804.36s)]
*  So Ray Kurzweil, who's been a dear friend and a mentor, his prediction is that we'll [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=807.24s)]
*  reach longevity escape velocity by the end of the year 2030. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=812.84s)]
*  And longevity escape velocity, for those who haven't heard the term, hopefully if they're [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=817.2800000000001s)]
*  listening to this podcast, they've heard it. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=820.76s)]
*  It's the idea that at some point in the future, for every year that you're alive, science [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=822.24s)]
*  is extending your life for more than a year. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=827.0400000000001s)]
*  And at that point, it basically departs and you're going as long as you want. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=830.12s)]
*  I've had the conversation with a multitude of different people and everybody's got a [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=836.36s)]
*  different guess. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=840.1800000000001s)]
*  I just had a conversation with Demis Esabes not long ago and when he was on 60 Minutes, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=842.52s)]
*  he said he foresaw the end of all disease by the end of the decade. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=850.64s)]
*  So all disease by 2035. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=857.76s)]
*  And then Dario Amadei, the CEO of Anthropic at Davos said he expects that we could see [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=861.28s)]
*  a doubling of the human lifespan in 10 years time. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=869.5600000000001s)]
*  Those are good people to have in the same camp you are. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=875.32s)]
*  So what do you think about longevity escape velocity? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=880.0600000000001s)]
*  Is a concept worth thinking about? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=882.44s)]
*  When do you think we might hit that? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=884.62s)]
*  I don't have a number. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=886.6s)]
*  I'm actually just on the ground working as hard and fast as I can with my team. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=888.12s)]
*  But I do think now it's feasible. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=892.38s)]
*  There was a time in my career five years ago, maybe 10. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=894.24s)]
*  I thought this was so far into the future it wasn't worth talking about. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=899.32s)]
*  It's all speculation. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=904.36s)]
*  But now that the information theory of aging and the reset seems true and that we're entering [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=905.48s)]
*  the clinic with these age reversal technologies that can be used multiple times, not just [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=910.5600000000001s)]
*  once but you can keep doing it maybe 20 times, 100 times, I think it's possible that within [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=915.5200000000001s)]
*  our lifetime we'll see such the ability to reset yourself. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=922.0400000000001s)]
*  I don't think we're going to live forever because there's always noise and information [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=926.44s)]
*  is hard to preserve indefinitely. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=931.6s)]
*  But I do believe that we could double the human lifespan now. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=934.6800000000001s)]
*  I'm on record and I've taken some flack over the years from colleagues who didn't like [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=938.08s)]
*  me saying that the first person to live to 150 has already been born. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=942.48s)]
*  But I still stand by that because you know, teenager today will live into the 22nd century. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=947.9200000000001s)]
*  We have to remember that. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=953.5400000000001s)]
*  It's not about today's technology. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=954.92s)]
*  I have two 14 year old boys that I keep on telling that. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=955.92s)]
*  Yeah and just think about what's happened in the last 10 years. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=959.3599999999999s)]
*  We just can't imagine what's going to be in their lifespan. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=963.3199999999999s)]
*  And so that's why I think that it's quite possible that they will be able to live 150 [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=966.56s)]
*  or more. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=972.4799999999999s)]
*  But for us the question is, were we born one generation too early? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=973.6999999999999s)]
*  Us in our 50s. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=977.1999999999999s)]
*  The answer is no. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=978.1999999999999s)]
*  The answer is actually since I was 18, I decided damn it, I don't want to be part of the last [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=979.72s)]
*  generation to live a normal human lifespan. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=985.96s)]
*  That's not right. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=987.9200000000001s)]
*  And I know it's coming, just a question of can we do it in time for all of us? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=989.0s)]
*  And I think the best way to ensure that we reach that point if there is an escape velocity [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=993.2800000000001s)]
*  is to stay healthy. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=998.6800000000001s)]
*  And that's why we should talk today about what we can do in our lives to stay healthy [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1000.4000000000001s)]
*  into our 90s and 100 because certainly by the time you and I are 90 or 100, the technology [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1005.4s)]
*  is going to be there to reset our age. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1010.12s)]
*  At this exponential age and what's going on with AI and I was with Eric Schmidt just recently [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1012.0s)]
*  in our last podcast and he's like, we will reach digital super intelligence within the [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1017.22s)]
*  decade. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1022.1600000000001s)]
*  And this is not just AGI, whatever AGI means, this is billions of fold more intelligent [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1023.52s)]
*  than human. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1029.16s)]
*  And of course the work going on right now of being able to model a cell in silico, we'll [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1031.04s)]
*  get there and then we'll have a cell with David Sinclair's genome or my genome and you [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1036.04s)]
*  know exactly which molecules activate that or don't. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1042.08s)]
*  I want to go to a basic question, which I think is important for everybody to understand [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1046.0s)]
*  the answer to and I'd like to understand how you express it. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1051.1599999999999s)]
*  Why do we age in the first place? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1054.1599999999999s)]
*  We have the Greenland, we have the you know, bowhead whale lives to 200 years old, we live [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1059.68s)]
*  in the Greenland shark lives to 500 years old, has pups at 200 years old and we make [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1065.96s)]
*  it to 100 on a routinely regular basis. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1071.84s)]
*  But why do we age and why were there no factors selecting for us to live longer than that? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1075.2s)]
*  Yeah, well the first answer to the second question is there was no need and evolution [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1080.96s)]
*  doesn't build things that there's no need for and on the savanna we're likely to die [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1086.34s)]
*  from war or infection or salvation within 50 years. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1090.4199999999998s)]
*  So living to 100 was really not helpful. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1094.3s)]
*  The reason why we age is debated among academics but what I strongly believe based on the evidence [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1098.98s)]
*  that my lab's been garnering geese 25 years now is that it's not just wear and tear, we're [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1105.8999999999999s)]
*  not just breaking down, there aren't just things going wrong but it's all about information [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1111.5s)]
*  and entropy and that what keeps us young is that we have great information. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1116.46s)]
*  We've got our pristine genome and our pristine epigenome which are the structures that read [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1121.5s)]
*  the genome and those two elements of information they get lost over time due to noise and we've [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1126.46s)]
*  identified some of the causes of that noise, DNA breaks of chromosomes as part of that [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1133.38s)]
*  noise, stress on a cell, if you crush a nerve cell it will accelerate its aging we showed [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1137.9s)]
*  in the 2020 nature paper and so I think of the body not like a lump of meat now, I think [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1143.74s)]
*  of it like a computer and the software gets corrupted over time and then the great news [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1150.02s)]
*  is we found that there's a backup copy of that software that can be reset. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1154.42s)]
*  Amazing, you've not done any really any podcasts in the last few years so I'm super happy to [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1157.94s)]
*  have you here so I really want to go into what you've learned. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1164.42s)]
*  So the information theory of aging, you published that as part of your book Lifespan, Time did [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1168.9s)]
*  an amazing piece on you and the information theory of aging so I was so happy that Mark [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1176.94s)]
*  Benioff Owens Time did that, I was like yes it's good to get the exposure for this. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1183.1000000000001s)]
*  Have you, so let's take it a step further in explaining what that information of, what [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1189.54s)]
*  that aging theory means and have you had any new proof points supporting that in the lab? [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1195.02s)]
*  Yeah, we've come a long way since 2020. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1200.54s)]
*  Just to settle things, you know you get 3.2 billion letters from your mom, 3.2 billion [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1202.9799999999998s)]
*  letters from your dad, that's your genome, it doesn't change over the course of your [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1207.82s)]
*  life so I like to ask people like why do you look different at 20 and 100, why don't you [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1211.8999999999999s)]
*  look the same and that genome codes for what's the current estimate, 22,000 genes thereabouts. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1218.1s)]
*  So epigenetics is effectively which genes are on and which genes are off, right? [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1225.78s)]
*  As you age, if I just have this right, as you're aging the wrong genes turn on and the [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1235.4199999999998s)]
*  wrong genes might turn off and that's causing some of this aging effect. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1242.98s)]
*  I can't add a lot to that. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1247.78s)]
*  You summed up the theory well and I did put it in Lifespan, the book, so if anyone hasn't [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1249.42s)]
*  read Lifespan it's all in there and book two hopefully next year will come out. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1253.1s)]
*  But it was a risk putting it in that theory and all of our results into the book because [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1258.78s)]
*  we hadn't published it yet. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1264.18s)]
*  But since then, since 2020 when the book came out we have published a couple of big papers, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1266.7s)]
*  one in Nature and one in Cell and it's really strong evidence now that the theory stands up. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1272.8s)]
*  What have we learned since? [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1280.56s)]
*  Well we're trying to figure out how is it possible to reset a cell and get back the [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1282.44s)]
*  original structures of the epigenome and if we were to dive into the cell, okay let's [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1286.44s)]
*  say we're going to pierce the membrane, go inside a cell then you swim down and then [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1292.44s)]
*  you see the nucleus, there's another membrane, there are little pores in the membrane, you [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1296.1599999999999s)]
*  can swim through those, now we can see the chromosomes and that's really the epigenome [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1299.4399999999998s)]
*  and if we unwrap those chromosomes what we would see is the six feet of DNA that's in [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1304.9199999999998s)]
*  the cell, of every cell, but the DNA is wrapped up in proteins and that wrapping is important [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1310.8799999999999s)]
*  for two reasons. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1318.36s)]
*  One is that's how you fit six feet into a microscopic cell but also whether it's wrapped [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1319.36s)]
*  tightly or not determines whether a gene is on or off and if it's tightly bundled we [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1323.6799999999998s)]
*  call that silent chromatin or such heterochromatin and a lot of the genes you want to be switched [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1328.44s)]
*  off because you don't want a liver specific gene on in the brain and vice versa. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1334.96s)]
*  So there are these bundles of DNA and loops of DNA. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1339.8400000000001s)]
*  And when it's bundled tightly it can't be read, it can't be transcribed. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1343.2s)]
*  Because it's hidden, exactly, it's tightly bundled and actually one of the big clues [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1347.0s)]
*  that this was relevant to aging was when I was in the lab of Lenny Guarente as a 25 year [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1351.76s)]
*  old postdoc and as a team we uncovered that there were these silent information regulator [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1355.88s)]
*  genes called the sirtuins and their job is to bundle up DNA. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1362.48s)]
*  And at the time we're thinking what the heck has bundling DNA got to do with aging? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1366.8400000000001s)]
*  We were expecting to see antioxidant genes and telomere extending genes but we found [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1370.44s)]
*  these silent information regulators and that's why information has been key to my research [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1374.92s)]
*  ever since. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1379.72s)]
*  Getting back to what happens during aging is that these bundles and these loops they [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1381.4s)]
*  change over time in part because the cell loses the ability to bundle them and you get [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1385.2s)]
*  these loops open up. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1391.48s)]
*  But also because the epigenome is changing all the time, our genome is stable, we don't [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1394.64s)]
*  change our genome much and in fact mutations are not as abundant as we thought. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1399.1200000000001s)]
*  And you can actually, I could take one of your cells and clone you and even though your [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1403.8s)]
*  cells are old we can start new life with those cells. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1407.16s)]
*  I love that, right? [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1409.96s)]
*  And so I know one experiment, a set of experiments were done actually took cells from 23 sequential [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1411.56s)]
*  mice clones that showed you could take a cell, clone the mouse, grow it out, take a cell, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1421.9199999999998s)]
*  clone the mouse, grow it out and they just, I think they got bored and stopped at the [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1428.96s)]
*  end of the 20. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1431.76s)]
*  And they're still healthy, right? [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1432.76s)]
*  These mice aren't getting old. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1433.76s)]
*  But if the old theory is correct that mutations cause aging then you just end up getting older [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1434.76s)]
*  and older babies. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1439.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1440.2s)]
*  So therefore I'm very convinced so far that the epigenome is the issue because going through [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1441.88s)]
*  sperm and egg and fertilization resets the epigenome. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1448.76s)]
*  So you can start life again. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1451.88s)]
*  But the good news is we figured out a way to safely reset that without having to clone [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1453.96s)]
*  yourself. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1458.28s)]
*  So think of it like that as resetting the system, like going through conception without [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1459.28s)]
*  having to be reborn. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1464.52s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1466.68s)]
*  So the control of the epigenome, I know for example skin has a multitude of different [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1468.8s)]
*  proteins, collagen molecules. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1479.0s)]
*  And as you grow older, one of the reasons your skin ages is those collagen molecules, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1481.44s)]
*  the genes those collagen molecules get silenced. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1487.08s)]
*  And so one could imagine unsilencing them. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1489.98s)]
*  So we do that in the lab all the time. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1493.0s)]
*  We have a skin project. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1494.68s)]
*  So yeah, you have to imagine it. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1495.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1497.76s)]
*  I'll show you. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1498.76s)]
*  I can't wait for the product to come out. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1499.76s)]
*  We think skin is a good model. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1502.04s)]
*  It also may help some people with wound healing and how they look. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1503.8799999999999s)]
*  But we actually grow bundles of human skin and hair in the lab. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1507.84s)]
*  And for those of you who are queasy, you may not want to hear this, but we open up that [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1511.68s)]
*  organoid of human tissue that we grow. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1516.4s)]
*  And these are engineered to be able to drive aging forwards and backwards so we can study [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1520.28s)]
*  that. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1523.8s)]
*  But we put them in the backs of mice. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1524.8s)]
*  And now it's pretty funny. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1526.4s)]
*  And the mice give the blood supply and keep it alive. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1528.28s)]
*  Yeah, but you get human black hair growing out of the back of a mouse. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1530.76s)]
*  Now we can age that hair, make it gray, make it old. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1533.84s)]
*  And now we test if we can reverse it. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1536.96s)]
*  And so far it looks good. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1538.56s)]
*  Well, if you can do that, I think you get another huge winner. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1539.56s)]
*  I'll never forget at the Abundance Summit, which I've had you speak at a couple of times [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1542.64s)]
*  and you're going to be back in 2026. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1546.28s)]
*  Thank you for that. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1547.92s)]
*  Sure. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1548.92s)]
*  Eric Schmidt will be our opener. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1549.92s)]
*  You'll be our closer that year. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1550.92s)]
*  That'll be fun. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1552.3600000000001s)]
*  I remember I had a biotech longevity scientist on stage and he was talking about his technology, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1554.1599999999999s)]
*  how it could cure cancer, it could increase the health of particular organs. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1562.8799999999999s)]
*  And he's giving this entire list of what it could do. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1568.1999999999998s)]
*  And then he says, and it can grow hair. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1571.04s)]
*  And the crowd erupts in applause. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1573.2399999999998s)]
*  It's like... [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1576.28s)]
*  Yeah, I remember that. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1577.28s)]
*  Yeah, so people do care about skin and hair. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1578.28s)]
*  But we're also learning fundamentals about what makes cells old and how do we reverse [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1580.8s)]
*  that and skin is just one... [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1586.6s)]
*  So the original data set that is there that helps the cell remember its original state, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1588.76s)]
*  have you found out where that lives? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1600.04s)]
*  Oh, well, the answer is probably. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1602.12s)]
*  I'm going to wait to reveal that in detail. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1606.84s)]
*  I have some very good students working on that right now. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1611.1599999999999s)]
*  And I wrote a review in one of the nature journals about this. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1614.76s)]
*  So if anyone's interested, you can go see my ideas. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1619.52s)]
*  But basically what we need for this to be real is there's a memory of youth in every [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1622.48s)]
*  old cell. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1629.48s)]
*  So what is that memory? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1630.6399999999999s)]
*  It's got to be probably something physical. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1632.32s)]
*  Could be a chemical modification of the DNA, chemical modifications of the proteins... [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1634.6399999999999s)]
*  Like a methylation or... [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1638.96s)]
*  It could be methylation, could be something else, could be some other type of novel genetic [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1640.44s)]
*  material, or it could just be proteins that permanently stick to the chromosome and stay [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1645.48s)]
*  there until we need them to reset. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1650.72s)]
*  I figure you would have... [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1653.96s)]
*  People would have seen this by now. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1655.84s)]
*  Oh, well. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1657.96s)]
*  What I can say is people have bumped into this and ignored it because they didn't think [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1659.74s)]
*  it was important. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1663.56s)]
*  I read through all of your tweets as we got ready for this. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1664.56s)]
*  And I love one of these. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1668.12s)]
*  It says, yourselves remember how to be young. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1669.12s)]
*  We just need to remind them. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1672.1599999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1674.08s)]
*  And my students are great and they are... [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1675.08s)]
*  I came to your lab a month ago and I met many of them and they are brilliant. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1679.12s)]
*  Yeah, they're like my children, actually. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1684.24s)]
*  On some days, I love them more than my own children. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1687.56s)]
*  But yeah, they're a very special group and they are working so hard to change the world [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1691.4399999999998s)]
*  and make these medicines a reality. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1696.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and we'll talk about the insanity of funding cuts in a little bit and the importance [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1698.8799999999999s)]
*  of the work that you're doing. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1707.76s)]
*  So anything else you want to add on the information theory? [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1710.12s)]
*  Do you have experiments planned that will just nail this down? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1716.2399999999998s)]
*  How does a theory become just accepted gospel in fact? [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1719.56s)]
*  I think it happens at one funeral at a time. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1724.8s)]
*  I've been very pleasantly surprised that the theory, which is called ITOA for short, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1729.76s)]
*  is being well accepted by the community. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1736.6s)]
*  And there's more and more evidence every few weeks about this. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1741.28s)]
*  I think what will really convince people is when we disrupt the observer, we call it, [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1745.24s)]
*  so this backup copy based on Claude Shannon. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1751.16s)]
*  I'm a big fan of his and you know that. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1753.64s)]
*  And so for those of you who don't know about Claude Shannon, just briefly Claude was a [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1756.56s)]
*  scientist at MIT and Bell Labs who figured out the information theory of communication. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1761.0800000000002s)]
*  So the reason we have an internet is because of him. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1765.88s)]
*  And the same mathematics and concepts I poached and used them for aging. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1769.0s)]
*  And so the information theory of aging is all about the preservation of information [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1774.52s)]
*  and having a backup copy, which at the time he called it the observer. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1779.6399999999999s)]
*  So we still talk in my lab about finding the observer and the observer keeps a backup copy [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1782.4s)]
*  of the original signal. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1786.92s)]
*  And if you lose it, by the time it gets to the sender, you can go back and retrieve what's [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1788.76s)]
*  missing from the observer. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1792.4s)]
*  And so what we think is that the observer has a physical, as I mentioned, a state. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1794.44s)]
*  It's got information there. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1801.0s)]
*  We think we found that information. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1802.72s)]
*  It's novel biology. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1804.44s)]
*  And when we show, if we show that breaking that system prevents age reversal from happening, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1806.16s)]
*  then I think that the community will believe us. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1815.16s)]
*  Love it. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1817.56s)]
*  Love it. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1818.56s)]
*  So we just launched about 18 months ago, something called the $101 million HealthSpan XPRIZE. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1819.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1827.16s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1828.16s)]
*  I think you're in the process of registering for that competition. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1829.16s)]
*  We are registered. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1833.04s)]
*  Fantastic. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1834.6399999999999s)]
*  So we've had like 625 teams from around the world. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1835.6399999999999s)]
*  And for those who haven't heard me speak about it before, this is an XPRIZE, one of our largest. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1840.04s)]
*  We raised $157 million. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1845.3999999999999s)]
*  GSK is a big sponsor of it as well, but our primary two sponsors are gentlemen, Chip Wilson, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1847.92s)]
*  the founder of Lululemon, who has a muscular dystrophy called FSHD. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1854.72s)]
*  And he put in $36 million. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1860.4s)]
*  And then a group out of Saudi Arabia called Hevolution, think health and evolution, they [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1862.2800000000002s)]
*  put in $40 million. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1867.2800000000002s)]
*  I'm a multimillion dollar donor. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1868.8000000000002s)]
*  We have a lot of incredible people who are supporting this. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1871.0400000000002s)]
*  And the goal is, can we get the smartest people in the world, including you, working on reversing [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1873.72s)]
*  the loss of cognition, immune, and muscle? [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1879.8400000000001s)]
*  And I'm amazed the variety of different approaches. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1885.76s)]
*  I'm excited that your lab will be participating. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1888.8999999999999s)]
*  But we're seeing like a huge range, I mean, from cellular medicines to gene therapies [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1893.58s)]
*  to... [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1900.62s)]
*  So I want to ask you, beyond your own work, the State of the Union for age reversal, for [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1901.62s)]
*  longevity, is it still an uphill battle in the scientific world, in the funding world? [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1910.62s)]
*  Because it used to be a stigma if you said you're doing age reversal work, it was like, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1918.58s)]
*  oh, this person's insane. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1922.02s)]
*  Has that gotten better? [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1923.02s)]
*  Not much. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1926.3s)]
*  Especially age reversal. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1927.3s)]
*  There's still the old school in my field that doesn't like the word reversal. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1929.3s)]
*  But it's somewhat better that at least saying that you work on longevity isn't a stigma. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1934.3s)]
*  And there's a lot more funding outside of academia for this, of course. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1940.6999999999998s)]
*  In academia, there's less money than ever to study this topic, which is surprising given [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1944.94s)]
*  how much potential it has to change medic. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1949.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1952.46s)]
*  The interesting thing is it's coming... [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1953.46s)]
*  A lot of the funding from this is coming from the crypto community. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1954.54s)]
*  There's a great alignment between people who believe in crypto, it's the Bitcoin long-term [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1958.22s)]
*  vision for capital as well and longevity. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1963.3400000000001s)]
*  We've seen Jeff Bezos and Yuri Milner back Altos. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1966.8600000000001s)]
*  We've seen Brian Armstrong back New Limit. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1970.34s)]
*  We've seen Sam Altman back Retro. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1974.9399999999998s)]
*  So it's good to see some of these multi-billionaires backing these things. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1977.5s)]
*  I for one, if I had that level of capital, I'd be backing all of them. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1982.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1986.54s)]
*  Well, one or more of these companies could dominate pharmaceuticals in the 21st century. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1987.54s)]
*  It is a multi-trillion dollar marketplace. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1993.4199999999998s)]
*  I'm on stages, and perhaps you are too, and I ask, okay, you're 70 or 80 years old. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=1996.1799999999998s)]
*  This is a room of family offices, wealthy individuals. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2002.4599999999998s)]
*  You're slowly degrading as people do in the last decades. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2007.1399999999999s)]
*  Someone comes up to you and says, listen, here is a therapeutic. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2012.86s)]
*  It will give you an extra 20 healthy years. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2017.02s)]
*  Not 20 healthy years right now, like where you were in your 50s. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2020.5s)]
*  How much of your wealth would you give for that? [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2026.78s)]
*  If they're honest, it would be the vast majority, 80 plus percent. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2029.9s)]
*  When I think about that, that is tens of trillions of dollars. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2034.6200000000001s)]
*  I think it's a giant market. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2040.9s)]
*  I'm hopeful that we'll see a lot more funding coming in from people, both philanthropically [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2042.38s)]
*  and investment-wise. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2048.54s)]
*  Me too. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2050.02s)]
*  Actually, the story I like is if you ask someone in their 30s, what would you do to trade with [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2051.02s)]
*  Warren Buffett? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2057.7s)]
*  No one says they'd trade with him, no matter how much money he has, because he's older. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2059.98s)]
*  The years you have are worth everything to you, more than money. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2064.38s)]
*  Agreed. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2069.58s)]
*  Everyone, as you know, earlier this year, I was on stage at the Abundance Summit with [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2070.58s)]
*  some incredible individuals, Kathy Wood, Mo Gadot, Vinod Khosla, Brett Adcock, and [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2075.66s)]
*  many other amazing tech CEOs. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2080.54s)]
*  I'm always asked, hey, Peter, where can I see the summit? [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2082.98s)]
*  Well, I'm finally releasing all the talks. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2086.18s)]
*  You can access my conversation with Kathy Wood and Mo Gadot for free at dmandus.com [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2089.1s)]
*  slash summit. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2095.22s)]
*  That's the talk with Kathy Wood and Mo Gadot for free at dmandus.com slash summit. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2096.22s)]
*  Enjoy. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2101.7s)]
*  I'll ask my team to put the links in the show notes below. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2102.7s)]
*  What else are you seeing out there that could be a viable age reversal therapeutic? [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2105.66s)]
*  Are you seeing any particular, without naming necessarily labs or anything but approaches? [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2114.22s)]
*  Well, there's a few. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2118.94s)]
*  I work on epigenetic reprogramming at Life Biosciences, and these companies you just [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2121.5s)]
*  mentioned, they're also chasing us. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2126.8199999999997s)]
*  We started a little earlier than they did, but they're trying to catch up. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2129.14s)]
*  That's a big area and why I'm hopeful that one or more of us is going to succeed. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2132.74s)]
*  I think that's for me the most promising. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2139.1s)]
*  That's why I'm putting my own money into it as well. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2141.14s)]
*  What else is important? [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2144.8999999999996s)]
*  Well, I think that there's factors from the blood. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2145.8999999999996s)]
*  We know that plasma phoresis, exchanging your plasma has some benefits and it's looking [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2150.02s)]
*  better all the time. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2155.14s)]
*  Like therapeutic plasma exchange. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2156.14s)]
*  That's right. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2157.14s)]
*  Yeah, I've done that five times now. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2158.14s)]
*  Right? [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2159.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2160.14s)]
*  I've done it maybe a few times, but I really believe in it because there's a lot of animal [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2161.14s)]
*  data and some human data coming that looks good. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2164.7s)]
*  But what is it about that that's beneficial? [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2167.2999999999997s)]
*  We're actually trying to turn that into a pill, but stay tuned for that because it'll [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2169.3799999999997s)]
*  be easier than sitting with the machine for an hour. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2174.46s)]
*  But that sounds promising, right? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2178.22s)]
*  That there's something in our blood that's keeping us old or fresh that comes in that [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2179.22s)]
*  makes us young. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2183.42s)]
*  There's some factors already companies are working on. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2184.42s)]
*  I think there might be a few really good ones that you could take as a drip and rejuvenate. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2186.46s)]
*  There was a promise of GDF 11 years ago. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2190.98s)]
*  I mean, the problem is a lot of these companies get funded with seed capital, but being a [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2193.94s)]
*  biology medical company is expensive and they run out of capital. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2201.02s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2206.5800000000004s)]
*  And I think there's something that we haven't found yet that's going to be more rejuvenative. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2207.5800000000004s)]
*  We're screening these proteins in the blood and genes that do epigenetic reprogramming. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2212.98s)]
*  And so you could imagine that there's a peptide perhaps or a protein that is circulating in [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2221.22s)]
*  the blood and when it circulates, it triggers these genes that give rejuvenation. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2227.22s)]
*  So we're looking for that. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2232.62s)]
*  Stem cells, it's been a bit slow, but we're starting to see a resurgence of stem cell [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2234.5s)]
*  interest and approval. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2240.3s)]
*  So the FDA now approves certain types of stem cell therapy. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2241.3s)]
*  Yeah, and we've just seen states begin to become much more lenient. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2244.2200000000003s)]
*  So Florida is in the process of passing regulation to allow you to do stem cell treatments in [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2248.6200000000003s)]
*  state. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2254.3s)]
*  I think it was Utah is there already, other places, which is great because before this, [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2255.3s)]
*  you'd go to Panama or Costa Rica or Antigua to do it, which is fine, except you don't [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2260.1000000000004s)]
*  have your medical team around you and you're operating XUS. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2266.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2270.1400000000003s)]
*  So presumably Fountain Life is going to get into that. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2271.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, Fountain Life, we have two centers right now in Naples and Orlando and we're opening [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2273.5s)]
*  up Miami and those will all have hopefully the most advanced stem cell therapeutics available [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2279.14s)]
*  as well as other cell limits like NK cell supplementation. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2285.58s)]
*  Yeah, which kill cancer cells. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2289.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and natural killer cells, your innate immune system kill cancers. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2290.98s)]
*  We're always developing cancers and we depend on our immune system to find them and kill [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2294.7799999999997s)]
*  them and the same NK cells also hunt down infected, virally infected cells. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2299.5s)]
*  Yeah, well we're working on a new type of stem cell, a very rare type. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2305.06s)]
*  We should talk because there's something that, there's a stem cell that actually turns into [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2309.34s)]
*  the tissue that it lands in and that's different than current stem cells. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2312.78s)]
*  Wow, interesting. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2316.86s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2317.86s)]
*  I think that area has promised too. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2318.86s)]
*  Senescent cell killing chemicals, somewhat promising. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2321.98s)]
*  I saw Altos bought a company or is merging with a company that works on that. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2325.82s)]
*  It's been a little slow, a little bit disappointing with Unity. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2331.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so surprised. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2335.7000000000003s)]
*  So Unity Biosciences goes public and then their data comes back and they crash and they're [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2337.42s)]
*  slowly slowly eking their way back. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2342.7400000000002s)]
*  It wasn't a complete failure, just they didn't reach the end point. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2344.46s)]
*  So there's a lot of variability, so that's part of the issue. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2347.0600000000004s)]
*  But I think they'll keep pushing on and they'll find something. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2349.82s)]
*  These senescent cells are important. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2354.0600000000004s)]
*  We know from a lot of studies that if you delete these cells, you can improve metabolism [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2355.42s)]
*  and a bunch of other things. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2360.34s)]
*  Can you use epigenetic reprogramming to move senescent cells back to normal healthy cells? [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2362.86s)]
*  We have a project in my lab on that and so far it looks like yes, we can do both rejuvenation [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2367.94s)]
*  of stem cells, of senescent cells so that they don't cause havoc. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2374.46s)]
*  They normally cause a lot of inflammation and even cancer. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2378.98s)]
*  So we can stop that with reprogramming, but in some cases we can even rejuvenate them [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2382.46s)]
*  so they grow again. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2388.2200000000003s)]
*  Normally they're sitting and they don't grow. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2389.42s)]
*  Just for folks, there's something called the Hayflick limit, which is, was it 50 cell replications [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2391.1s)]
*  thereabouts? [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2395.7s)]
*  That a cell should replicate 50 times and then have the decency to die. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2397.1s)]
*  And if it doesn't, it can become a cancer cell or a senescent cell, which is pumping [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2401.98s)]
*  out these inflammatory factors. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2407.06s)]
*  And so you can either kill them or you can cure them. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2409.18s)]
*  And so it looks like we can cure them, but we're not sure if that's a good thing. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2411.42s)]
*  We have to figure out if curing a senescent cell will just give us more problems. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2416.3s)]
*  But at least in tissue culture, it looks like reprogramming does work in that regard. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2420.1s)]
*  And also you might, somebody might be asking, you might be asking if you reprogram a cancer [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2425.16s)]
*  cell, what happens? [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2429.54s)]
*  Oh yeah, fascinating. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2430.54s)]
*  I have good news on that front. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2431.54s)]
*  Okay, do tell. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2432.9s)]
*  One of my graduate students has been working on this for a few years and we have a lot [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2433.9s)]
*  of evidence that many types of cancers are killed by reprogramming, which is interesting [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2437.14s)]
*  if you think about it. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2443.3399999999997s)]
*  Oh, so you have a cancer cell, it's growing, you've discovered it at stage three or stage [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2444.3399999999997s)]
*  four and it's through different parts of the body. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2449.22s)]
*  You hit it with an epigenetic reprogramming cocktail and it has a decency to die? [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2453.08s)]
*  Well I think it freaks out and realizes it wakes up from its zombie-like state and says, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2460.3399999999997s)]
*  oh my goodness, my chromosomes are messed up, I better kill myself. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2465.58s)]
*  Because one of the ways to become a cancer cell is to ignore its DNA damage. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2469.2599999999998s)]
*  They're filled with DNA damage. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2474.22s)]
*  And when we wake them up, they can, so if you wake up a normal cell, it goes back and [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2476.46s)]
*  it gets younger. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2481.2999999999997s)]
*  But if you wake up a cancer cell, it looks like it realizes it should kill itself and [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2482.2999999999997s)]
*  it does. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2485.98s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2486.98s)]
*  That's crazy amazing. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2487.98s)]
*  All right, so I want to dive into a couple of your companies that I'm tracking. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2491.38s)]
*  I've had them on my stages at the Abundance Platinum event, which I do every fall. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2497.82s)]
*  For those of you interested, David and I will be together in Boston. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2503.7000000000003s)]
*  Our Abundance Platinum trip this year is the last five days of September. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2508.3s)]
*  If you want more information, you can go to abundance360.com slash longevity. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2512.76s)]
*  Life Biosciences and MetroBioTech, two very cool companies. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2520.02s)]
*  Let's talk about each of those. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2524.74s)]
*  Shall we start with Life Biosciences? [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2525.74s)]
*  This is the more recent one. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2527.78s)]
*  This was founded in 2017-18. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2528.78s)]
*  And they're the ones that have shown in monkeys that you can basically cure blindness and [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2531.42s)]
*  get vision back. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2536.7s)]
*  And so the first studies will be in January if all goes well. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2537.7s)]
*  So you've gone originally from mice to monkeys, so non-human primates, and it worked as expected [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2540.34s)]
*  in both cases? [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2550.58s)]
*  It worked better than expected actually. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2551.58s)]
*  And so far, there's no signs of any reason why we shouldn't go into humans next year. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2554.34s)]
*  It's going to depend on the FDA, but we're planning to submit what's called an IND shortly. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2559.0s)]
*  And hopefully by this time next year, we'll know if it's working because the studies are [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2564.54s)]
*  straight into patients. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2568.9s)]
*  And so is it a single injection? [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2570.32s)]
*  What is it? [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2573.36s)]
*  Oh, good question. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2574.36s)]
*  It's a single injection. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2575.76s)]
*  So with macular degeneration, it's very common to get one injection or more. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2577.36s)]
*  You don't feel it's nothing bad. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2581.88s)]
*  And what this virus does, so the AAV you mentioned goes into the nerves at the back of the eye. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2584.28s)]
*  And we just turn it on by giving the patient some antibiotic, doxycycline. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2588.32s)]
*  Doxycycline, right? [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2591.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2592.8s)]
*  Which is, by the way, is just the trigger that turns on that segment of DNA. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2594.28s)]
*  Yeah, so we put in those three genes inside the virus. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2600.88s)]
*  So we normally have these genes. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2605.76s)]
*  We're not changing the genome, but by putting these three genes in the virus, we can control [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2606.92s)]
*  them better. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2611.52s)]
*  And now they're what's called dox-inducible. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2612.6400000000003s)]
*  And we could have used any chemical. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2615.32s)]
*  Doesn't have to be dox, but dox is an easy way. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2617.04s)]
*  And it's been in research for decades. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2620.5600000000004s)]
*  So we chose that. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2622.28s)]
*  But yeah, so by this time next year, we should know if it can improve vision in people that [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2623.6800000000003s)]
*  have gone blind either from a stroke in their eye or from glaucoma. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2629.0s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2632.7200000000003s)]
*  How big will your phase one be, you think? [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2633.7200000000003s)]
*  It's a small study, right? [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2635.6400000000003s)]
*  You start with one and then two, then 10. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2637.1200000000003s)]
*  And we're just raising money to go into our phase two study already. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2641.0400000000004s)]
*  Awesome. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2644.7200000000003s)]
*  Any other elements of life biosciences besides that specific one? [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2645.76s)]
*  Some of it, I'm bound by confidentiality, but I can say in general that the company [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2651.12s)]
*  has that's phase one for the company. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2655.6s)]
*  Let's call it stage one, not to confuse it with clinical trials. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2658.88s)]
*  Stage one is proof of concept in the eye. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2661.8399999999997s)]
*  Does it work? [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2664.24s)]
*  Two shots on goal, two diseases. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2665.24s)]
*  Stage two for the company, which is already underway, is using AI to convert to chemicals. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2668.3599999999997s)]
*  So you have a pill instead or an LNP, which is the lipid nanoparticles. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2673.16s)]
*  You don't use viruses. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2677.08s)]
*  Whole body rejuvenation. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2678.3599999999997s)]
*  Nice. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2679.6s)]
*  They're already doing that. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2680.6s)]
*  And then stage three would be going into multiple diseases and eventually whole body rejuvenation. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2681.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2688.0s)]
*  So let's pause right there and focus in on this. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2689.28s)]
*  So I think one of the realizations is for those who develop a disease, when you were [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2692.08s)]
*  younger you didn't have the disease. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2697.2000000000003s)]
*  And so if you're able to actually induce some type of age reversal, does that cure the disease? [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2699.56s)]
*  In mice it's working great. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2707.72s)]
*  So for instance, glaucoma is an age related disease. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2709.2s)]
*  You make the eye young again in the animal, the disease goes away. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2713.16s)]
*  The body can heal itself. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2716.8399999999997s)]
*  And that's been really not the approach of medicine as we know it. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2718.68s)]
*  Medicine as you know, you're a trained doctor, is we treat the symptoms of this disease and [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2722.6s)]
*  slow it or cure it. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2727.64s)]
*  But we don't use the body's own healing properties. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2729.12s)]
*  Now we've uncovered the ultimate healing property. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2731.64s)]
*  We believe that we've uncovered the ability that salamanders have to regrow limbs and [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2734.36s)]
*  fish grow new tails, similar process. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2738.6800000000003s)]
*  And we just turn on these embryonic genes and now we get youth and now the body can [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2741.6800000000003s)]
*  heal itself. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2745.76s)]
*  So besides vision, what else have we tried? [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2746.76s)]
*  Well, in my lab we've done Alzheimer's disease, cured. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2749.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2752.6800000000003s)]
*  Some muscle diseases, cured. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2753.6800000000003s)]
*  ALS, pretty cured. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2756.84s)]
*  And that's important because in my partner's family we have ALS, so we're rushing to fix [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2760.42s)]
*  that one. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2765.98s)]
*  We published with a collaborator that we could alleviate multiple sclerosis with this as [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2767.46s)]
*  well. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2774.1800000000003s)]
*  So, so far we have not seen a disease or an injury that could not be effectively treated [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2775.1800000000003s)]
*  with this therapy. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2780.34s)]
*  Now it doesn't mean everything can be cured, but what it's telling me is that diseases [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2781.86s)]
*  that we've been treating, really we've just been addressing the symptoms, not the underlying [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2786.82s)]
*  cause and finally now we're treating what's really underlying most diseases, which is [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2790.82s)]
*  the aging, universal aging process itself. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2795.2200000000003s)]
*  And the challenge is today's medical system is built all around just treating the symptoms. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2798.02s)]
*  It's built around keeping you alive and treating what's possible, but not curing you. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2806.1000000000004s)]
*  I mean, it's really quite insane. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2812.7000000000003s)]
*  Whole body rejuvenation, again, by taking a set of pills. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2816.8999999999996s)]
*  We don't see, like one arm get younger than the other arm, we don't see any of that going [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2824.8199999999997s)]
*  on. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2831.06s)]
*  So the notion is that if you're going to be able to reverse the aging of a particular [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2833.3799999999997s)]
*  skin or muscle or hepatic, that it's going to hit all tissues, all organs. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2840.38s)]
*  Well that's the ultimate goal and we're already testing in mice how that works. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2850.0600000000004s)]
*  There was another lab, our collaborators out of George Church's lab where we, collaborating [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2855.7400000000002s)]
*  with George, you know George, is in my department at Harvard. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2860.1000000000004s)]
*  We collaborated initially on building these viruses and they did the experiment that I [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2863.54s)]
*  thought was really interesting, which was just to inject the virus not just into the [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2868.86s)]
*  eye, but injected into the vein of the mouse. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2872.7400000000002s)]
*  And if we're right, the mice should live longer. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2875.94s)]
*  And even though this was a Hail Mary experiment, not optimized, those old mice that they treated [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2878.54s)]
*  lived another 109% longer. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2884.1800000000003s)]
*  Okay, so I have to ask you this question at this point. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2886.46s)]
*  We talk about mice. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2890.38s)]
*  Lab mice are experimented on everything and a typical lab mouse lives how long? [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2894.18s)]
*  24 months? [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2900.2599999999998s)]
*  36 months? [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2901.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, 28 months. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2902.2599999999998s)]
*  28 months, okay. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2903.2599999999998s)]
*  Why aren't we seeing mice that are living not two years, but 10 years at this point? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2906.62s)]
*  What's going on there? [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2913.54s)]
*  Because I think we were taking the wrong approach. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2914.7799999999997s)]
*  What happened to the field, unfortunately, in the 2000s... [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2917.2599999999998s)]
*  By the way, I just noted this real quick for reference. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2919.42s)]
*  In June of 1982, Richard Weindrud and Roy Walford at UCLA showed that life extension [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2923.1800000000003s)]
*  of 30 to 40% was possible through calorie restriction to get a mouse to what is currently [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2932.38s)]
*  the record of 53 months. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2937.94s)]
*  So you just have to starve the mouse and you can almost double its lifespan, which I don't [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2940.38s)]
*  think anybody here wants to do. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2945.3s)]
*  It'll certainly make life feel longer. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2947.26s)]
*  But yeah, those guys showed early on that you can extend lifespan through diet, but [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2949.1400000000003s)]
*  it's not pleasant. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2954.5800000000004s)]
*  But now we're seeing combination drugs. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2955.86s)]
*  There was one published last week that a combination of two anti-cancer drugs could extend lifespan [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2958.6200000000003s)]
*  of mice 30%. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2963.98s)]
*  So we're approaching the same levels of extension as we saw with those early studies. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2965.0600000000004s)]
*  But ultimately, we want to make mice live five times longer, 10 times longer. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2972.0800000000004s)]
*  What do you think will get there? [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2976.3s)]
*  I mean, and I don't care about the mouse living longer. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2977.3s)]
*  I just want some additional evidence that we moved the needle. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2980.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2983.46s)]
*  Well, our field has made lower organisms live 10 times longer. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2984.46s)]
*  So what is it about mammals that's harder? [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2987.7000000000003s)]
*  I think we were just taking the wrong approach. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2989.9s)]
*  We were saying, oh, let's try this molecule that turns on this longevity pathway or that [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2991.46s)]
*  longevity pathway. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2995.46s)]
*  Most of these longevity pathways that we worked on starting in the 2000s with molecules to [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=2996.78s)]
*  tweak them, we were just slowing aging. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3002.82s)]
*  We weren't reversing aging. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3006.38s)]
*  I think with this new age reversal approach and these technologies, the gene therapy and [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3008.1800000000003s)]
*  these new cocktails that we have in my lab, we have a much better chance of being able [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3012.42s)]
*  to repeatedly reverse aging and get them out to maybe five years. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3016.38s)]
*  And I'm excited about this because remember I said over the holiday break, within four [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3021.98s)]
*  weeks we made them basically young mice again. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3026.2200000000003s)]
*  We want to try this over the lifespan and we've got a good chance I think of growing [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3030.1s)]
*  them away. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3034.38s)]
*  Can't wait. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3035.38s)]
*  When might you do that? [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3036.38s)]
*  When might you run that experiment? [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3037.38s)]
*  Well, as soon as we have the money to do that, right? [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3038.38s)]
*  So let's see if we can do that. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3040.14s)]
*  All right. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3041.86s)]
*  We're going to talk about money in just a little bit. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3042.86s)]
*  I do want to hit on a basic idea that I want people to understand, which is the idea of [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3045.36s)]
*  seven sirtuin genes or these proteins and the battle between DNA repair and epigenetic [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3052.38s)]
*  drift. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3062.7999999999997s)]
*  So if I understand from reading your book and speaking to you what we have are these [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3064.2999999999997s)]
*  seven sirtuins that are conserved across almost all life. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3068.56s)]
*  Yeah, even bacteria. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3074.5s)]
*  And as they have two functions in the cell, right? [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3076.62s)]
*  One is to repair DNA damage and one is to make sure that the right genes are on and [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3082.2599999999998s)]
*  the right genes are off. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3087.62s)]
*  Is that basically? [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3089.3399999999997s)]
*  And as we get older, and I'm pitching this back to you because this is how I explain [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3092.3399999999997s)]
*  on stage, we're accumulating some DNA damage and of course the sirtuins are going back [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3097.02s)]
*  and forth between these two functions. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3103.58s)]
*  And as we get older, our internal NAD levels drop by as much as 50%, right? [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3106.1s)]
*  And NAD is sort of the energy currency in the cell that powers these sirtuins. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3112.06s)]
*  And so if they're having less energy and having to go back and forth between DNA repair and [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3118.5s)]
*  epigenetic drift, our epigenome loses and we get aging. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3124.06s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3128.94s)]
*  Mostly. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3130.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3131.5s)]
*  So we're going to have to wait until we warm up. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3132.5s)]
*  Even without the decline in NAD, we have problems. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3134.06s)]
*  And we showed this in a mouse that we published in 2023 in the journal cell, was that even [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3136.66s)]
*  if we distracted the sirtuins from their main role of silencing genes, when a mouse was [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3141.56s)]
*  young that was enough to make them age 50% faster. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3147.14s)]
*  And these were called the ice mice, the inducible changes, the epigenome mice. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3151.38s)]
*  And so we created non-mutagenic cuts and that distracted the sirtuins from where they were [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3156.34s)]
*  on the chromosomes and they went elsewhere and often didn't come back to where they belonged. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3162.42s)]
*  And that just for three weeks was enough to trigger the domino effect of aging in those [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3168.04s)]
*  animals and they didn't just look old, they were old by every measure. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3171.86s)]
*  Their tissues were old, their physiology was old, their DNA methylation clocks were older. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3175.58s)]
*  And then we also did a little experiment to reverse their tissues at the end just for [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3180.7400000000002s)]
*  some fun. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3184.42s)]
*  Just for some fun. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3185.42s)]
*  Your lab must be a blast to work in. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3187.9s)]
*  I wish I go back to my medical school days and come and knock on your door and volunteer. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3189.7799999999997s)]
*  Let's talk about AI in your research because that's new since we last really went deep. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3193.7s)]
*  I mean the entire, the explosion of the AI field and understanding especially is applied [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3200.3799999999997s)]
*  to basic sciences. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3204.58s)]
*  So tell me, how are you using it? [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3206.98s)]
*  What's it doing for you? [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3209.8199999999997s)]
*  Well, it's central to everything now. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3210.8199999999997s)]
*  We barely run an experiment without consulting our AI agents. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3213.12s)]
*  We want to, let me tell you about two areas. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3218.02s)]
*  I think it'd be interesting. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3221.06s)]
*  The first is in visualization. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3222.48s)]
*  We've developed algorithms. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3225.1s)]
*  It's called DASH AI. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3226.1s)]
*  I forget what it stands for, but basically the idea is that we can visualize old and [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3228.78s)]
*  young cells using a microscope and tell very quickly within nanoseconds what age those [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3233.56s)]
*  cells are just by looking at them. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3239.72s)]
*  Fascinating. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3241.3s)]
*  And that's important if we're sure and as we are screening the genes and molecules that [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3242.3s)]
*  control and reverse aging. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3245.86s)]
*  Measuring what matters. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3247.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3249.06s)]
*  And so we have a curve that stretches from 20 year old cells or cells from 20 year old [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3250.1000000000004s)]
*  skin cells to 93 year olds. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3257.86s)]
*  And within nanoseconds you can, not you, but the computer looks at the image and can say, [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3260.7000000000003s)]
*  all right, those cells were 93 last week and now they're 20. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3266.06s)]
*  And so we have chemicals that do that. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3271.82s)]
*  So that just gives you super rapid screening of all kinds of chemicals. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3273.06s)]
*  So that's using robotics and AI visualization. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3277.7799999999997s)]
*  That's one aspect. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3281.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3282.1s)]
*  But really what blows me away is the other part, which is we believe we found the four [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3283.1s)]
*  main levers to reverse aging. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3288.1s)]
*  What I mean by that is that there are enzymes that control the epigenome. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3290.0s)]
*  There are four main pathways and you want to pull back the lever. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3294.58s)]
*  So inhibit three of those and push one. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3301.46s)]
*  And that combination is the winning one. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3305.5800000000004s)]
*  And so we have chemicals that do that, but they're cocktails. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3307.5s)]
*  We published some of these. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3310.9s)]
*  These cocktails work on these four levers. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3311.9s)]
*  But what we really want is just one simple safe molecule because it's easier to develop [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3315.94s)]
*  as a medicine that does those four things. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3320.6200000000003s)]
*  Now if you'd said to even a pharmaceutical company with a billion dollars, did you do [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3323.9s)]
*  that? [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3329.26s)]
*  They would have said probably five years ago, no way. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3330.26s)]
*  And one of those lever pulls is hard enough. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3333.5s)]
*  Which I mean decades and billions of dollars. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3335.74s)]
*  Yeah, optimizing and physical screening and making the molecules by hand as chemists. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3337.66s)]
*  But now we can just take all known molecules and virtually screen them in a couple of months [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3343.26s)]
*  against all those four targets. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3347.18s)]
*  And so when you say take all known molecules, we're talking about actually physically doing [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3350.94s)]
*  this in a Petri dish? [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3357.18s)]
*  No, no, goodness. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3358.98s)]
*  That would take millions of years. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3359.98s)]
*  So what are you actually doing? [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3361.54s)]
*  Well, we virtually dock them into the enzymes. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3364.1800000000003s)]
*  And the AI is precise enough to create an actual sort of physical model? [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3367.6600000000003s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3375.7400000000002s)]
*  Demis and his team solved all of the structures as you know. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3376.7400000000002s)]
*  And so that made this all possible. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3380.1400000000003s)]
*  Now we can just do the number crunching. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3381.9s)]
*  And so yeah, so normally this docking would be done by hand by a person, would take days [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3385.6200000000003s)]
*  to do. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3390.8599999999997s)]
*  And now it's just done like this, this, this. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3392.1s)]
*  And you can do billions, actually trillions. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3393.98s)]
*  And there are libraries of virtual molecules, but also there are actually physical libraries. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3397.02s)]
*  So what's happened is we've now got a set of 100 top candidates, some synthetic, some [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3401.74s)]
*  natural, and we can just order them like you would on Amazon, bring in your chemicals and [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3406.7s)]
*  put them through our AI assisted screening. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3412.3799999999997s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3414.74s)]
*  Earlier you said it was going to be a cocktail of four molecules that you're trying now. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3416.22s)]
*  Yeah, we published six and we're now down to three. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3421.2599999999998s)]
*  And if all goes well, we've got one. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3425.4199999999996s)]
*  And you believe you can get it down to one? [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3427.4199999999996s)]
*  Well, we're testing them now and they look good so far. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3429.4199999999996s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3432.22s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3433.22s)]
*  I want to turn to a subject that's a bit painful and recent and very impactful about this longevity [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3434.22s)]
*  future, which is funding. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3444.94s)]
*  It's been a travesty of the massive cuts in science. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3448.94s)]
*  And I know you've been hit hard by it. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3455.42s)]
*  How hard have you been hit? [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3457.58s)]
*  Well, I spend more time as a psychiatrist now than a doctor, than a scientist. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3460.94s)]
*  It's tough. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3466.78s)]
*  The poor kids in my lab who are innocent in this are really suffering. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3467.9s)]
*  What percentage of your lab is funded through that government grants? [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3471.74s)]
*  The majority is government funded and all of those grants were terminated. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3477.02s)]
*  100% of those grants were terminated? [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3481.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, they're all gone. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3483.2599999999998s)]
*  Any explanation as to why? [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3485.66s)]
*  Harvard's in the target of the federal government. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3488.62s)]
*  It's not just the Doge activities, it's Harvard's being specifically... [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3492.2999999999997s)]
*  They're singled out for quote unquote anti-Semitism, but taking it out on my poor students, [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3498.14s)]
*  who are like my own kids, it's rough. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3503.1s)]
*  Well, they're taking it out on the rest of us too. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3505.66s)]
*  If the science gets delayed by a year, that just puts another [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3507.66s)]
*  percentage of the population at risk of dying. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3512.8599999999997s)]
*  Well, we may never know what medicines will never exist in our lifetime because of this, [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3516.06s)]
*  unfortunately, because Harvard Medical School is the crown jewel of research in the world. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3520.54s)]
*  And to stop all that research. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3524.62s)]
*  I met one of my colleagues in the cafeteria last week, and he's a leading guy in his field. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3526.22s)]
*  And I said, what are you going to do now that you've got no money? [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3531.8199999999997s)]
*  He goes, I had a good run. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3534.54s)]
*  I'll go home. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3536.22s)]
*  I might write a book. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3536.8599999999997s)]
*  Wow. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3537.58s)]
*  It's done. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3538.14s)]
*  He's over. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3538.62s)]
*  His career has ended. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3539.1s)]
*  He's done. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3540.4599999999996s)]
*  But I'm not giving up. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3541.66s)]
*  I'm going to fight. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3543.02s)]
*  This is too important to give up. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3544.3799999999997s)]
*  As you should, I want to help you. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3545.5s)]
*  One of the things I realized is probably the single thing that the US could do [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3547.8999999999996s)]
*  to solve the US debt is give people an extra 20 years of health. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3555.1s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3561.66s)]
*  We've crunched the numbers. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3562.7799999999997s)]
*  I know. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3563.74s)]
*  So talk about that. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3564.14s)]
*  There was a study at Harvard London School of Business in Oxford on that. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3565.1s)]
*  What did the study say? [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3568.9399999999996s)]
*  What was the financial implication here? [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3571.18s)]
*  Yeah, so I teamed up with a couple of great economists, and they calculated that in the US, [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3572.9399999999996s)]
*  extending healthy lifespan just by one year. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3581.18s)]
*  By keeping people out of nursing homes and giving them back to the community and [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3584.22s)]
*  making them productive was a value to the US economy of $86 trillion. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3588.06s)]
*  That's just one year. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3593.1s)]
*  That's doable. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3594.22s)]
*  36 or 86? [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3595.4199999999996s)]
*  Did I say 36? [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3597.1s)]
*  No, you said 86. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3598.22s)]
*  I think it's 36. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3599.8999999999996s)]
*  It is 86 billion. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3600.9399999999996s)]
*  No, 86 trillion. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3603.2599999999998s)]
*  We will fact check that. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3606.14s)]
*  And then it was 366 or 7 trillion for 10 years. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3608.22s)]
*  Yeah, it's a lot. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3613.7400000000002s)]
*  These numbers are staggering. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3614.86s)]
*  This is like the defense budget. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3615.98s)]
*  I mean, this is people staying active and generating in the economy and not having to [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3617.7400000000002s)]
*  pay out on health care costs. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3624.3s)]
*  That's what it is. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3626.3s)]
*  And then people spend money, right? [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3627.02s)]
*  They're traveling and they're buying things. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3628.78s)]
*  I use my father as a role model. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3631.5s)]
*  And he's on our program or whatever he's doing well. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3633.9s)]
*  The update on him is he's turning 86. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3637.42s)]
*  And when most men at his age are in the ground or on the shelf, he is as young as he was [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3640.06s)]
*  when he was in his 40s. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3645.82s)]
*  Right? [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3647.34s)]
*  He acts, moves, travels, thinks, enjoys his life like we do. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3647.74s)]
*  And he's not slowing down at all. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3652.46s)]
*  He still drives at night without glasses. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3654.06s)]
*  You know, he has to take a test because he's old, but he passes with flying colors. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3656.7s)]
*  So think about if the population on average was like him, what kind of a world would it be? [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3661.02s)]
*  These people are valuable. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3666.06s)]
*  Every life is valuable. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3668.22s)]
*  You can even put dollars on every life's value. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3669.42s)]
*  I tell people, you know, if you're 80, but you feel like you're 50, you've got all of [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3673.34s)]
*  your relationships. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3679.82s)]
*  Are you going to want to retire or are you going to want to just, you know, go for the next thing? [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3681.1800000000003s)]
*  I mean, the reason people retire is they're in pain, they're out of energy, or they're [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3685.7400000000002s)]
*  forced to by regulation. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3691.02s)]
*  Yeah, or you don't like your job, but there's skill barricades. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3692.78s)]
*  And we live in a world where you can reinvent yourself pretty quickly. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3695.98s)]
*  And so I look forward to people like my dad, who started a new career in his 80s. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3699.1800000000003s)]
*  He was now supervising clinical trials and he's giving back to the communities. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3704.1400000000003s)]
*  He's living with one of my nephews who's raising my dad. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3707.98s)]
*  My dad at 86, nearly 86 is raising his nephew. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3711.98s)]
*  It should be the other way around, right? [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3716.2200000000003s)]
*  But now he's so healthy, he's taking care of his grandkid. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3717.9s)]
*  And you know, it's better that way because imagine life the other way around and you [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3721.9s)]
*  don't actually have to imagine it. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3725.98s)]
*  Just go to Japan where people our age are taking care of not just their parents, sometimes [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3727.18s)]
*  their grandparents and their kids, and sometimes their grandkids. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3732.54s)]
*  That's a huge burden on a generation to take care of both the people who are sick, older [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3736.14s)]
*  than them, and the young people who either don't have jobs or need help in other ways. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3740.46s)]
*  David, how much funding did your lab lose in total? [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3744.7s)]
*  It was millions. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3749.42s)]
*  And we're just at the beginning of some of these grants. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3750.7s)]
*  And one of the grants, by the way, was a career grant given to Kelly Rich, a postdoc, who [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3753.1s)]
*  has actually been speaking out in the media as to the cruelty of these cuts to her and [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3758.86s)]
*  the lab. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3763.9s)]
*  She was working on ALS in a race to try and help Serena's mom. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3764.7799999999997s)]
*  And we were making good progress. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3771.5s)]
*  We showed that these reprogramming chemicals and genes could treat neuromuscular disorders [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3772.7s)]
*  in mice. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3777.8199999999997s)]
*  And we're not that far away with AI of having something she could take as a pill. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3778.38s)]
*  Perhaps some natural molecules. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3783.18s)]
*  And to have the funding cut without really any explanation was more than a blow to us. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3784.86s)]
*  And so we've lost a lot of money and also the spirit to go on. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3790.54s)]
*  We have a lot of amazing people that watch this podcast, a lot of people who have made [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3794.94s)]
*  their wealth in digital assets and who are entrepreneurs. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3799.98s)]
*  And I think there is a very close connection between those who are deep in crypto, in Bitcoin, [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3804.06s)]
*  in Ethereum, and those who love longevity. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3811.9s)]
*  They're the best people. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3814.54s)]
*  They go in connection. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3815.5s)]
*  So I want to do three things. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3817.5s)]
*  And I mentioned to you beforehand, I want to do this. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3821.9s)]
*  And this is not something you asked for, something I want to do. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3824.62s)]
*  There are, and I'll speak into camera here, there are three ways that I want to [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3829.42s)]
*  invite you to join me in supporting David's research and his lab. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3834.86s)]
*  Again, this is not a request he made. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3839.82s)]
*  This is something I feel compelled to do because I care deeply about this work. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3841.82s)]
*  I care deeply about having it available personally for my family and for all of us. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3845.5800000000004s)]
*  And hopefully what you've seen here so far convinces you that there is real value [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3851.26s)]
*  that's being created. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3856.86s)]
*  And honestly, for the small amount of money that you spend, it's a travesty because it [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3858.46s)]
*  does compare a few million dollars to trillions of dollars of upside, let alone lives being saved. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3864.86s)]
*  So there is a link we're going to put in the show notes that is to donate directly to his lab at [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3871.98s)]
*  Harvard. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3880.86s)]
*  It's tax deductible. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3882.2200000000003s)]
*  You can donate from $50 to $1,000 and welcome you to do that. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3884.2200000000003s)]
*  And I'm sure David would be super grateful for it. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3889.58s)]
*  The second thing is we're going to put up a QR code here for a moment. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3895.1800000000003s)]
*  You can pause the video or go to the YouTube video if you're listening. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3901.34s)]
*  It's an audible to see it. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3904.46s)]
*  We'll also put the links in the show notes below where you can link to a Coinbase account [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3905.9s)]
*  where you can donate stablecoin, Bitcoin, or Ethereum. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3912.54s)]
*  And I welcome you to. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3916.6200000000003s)]
*  I really I hope you guys shock us and surprise us with your generosity. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3917.7400000000002s)]
*  If you're one of the many Bitcoin well billionaires out there listening to this podcast, [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3922.94s)]
*  I mean imagine what your donation could do. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3928.3s)]
*  It could move the needle here in an extraordinary way. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3932.54s)]
*  I always like to lead whenever I'm asking for any kind of donation. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3936.46s)]
*  So something I'm proposing, I just proposed it to David before this, [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3941.1800000000003s)]
*  is the creation of a program called Friends of Sinclair Lab. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3945.5800000000004s)]
*  And David, we talked about this. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3951.34s)]
*  This would be for, I want to keep it intimate enough so that the people who donate at this level [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3954.1400000000003s)]
*  get the benefit of building a relationship with you and getting early access to knowledge. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3960.0600000000004s)]
*  But the idea here would be people who donate $50,000 [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3965.9s)]
*  and I'm going to be the first to step up and donate $50,000. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3970.0600000000004s)]
*  Historically, my largest donations have been to the XPRIZE Foundation [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3973.42s)]
*  and to our Longevity, our HealthSpan prize, and also to Dean Kamen at First Robotics, [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3977.8999999999996s)]
*  and also to David. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3983.66s)]
*  Tony Robbins and I donated a quarter million dollars early on to support David's work. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3985.66s)]
*  So this idea of Friends of Sinclair Lab, if you want to join me at a 50k or greater level, [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=3992.06s)]
*  send an email to, let's see, I'm going to spell it out here, Friends of Sinclair Lab. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4000.06s)]
*  So f-o-s-l at deamandis.com. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4005.42s)]
*  My team will want to respond to that, get some information about you. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4010.7000000000003s)]
*  Please don't use it as an email to communicate with me or David. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4014.62s)]
*  That's not what its purpose is. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4018.7000000000003s)]
*  If you're serious about this, go ahead and send an email there with your contact details [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4020.06s)]
*  and we'll respond. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4026.14s)]
*  And what we talked about, for those who join the Friends of Sinclair Lab, [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4028.2200000000003s)]
*  let's see what we said. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4032.3s)]
*  Number one, we'll do a quarterly Zoom. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4033.5800000000004s)]
*  I expect this will be a group of 10, 12, hopefully 20 people that we'll spend some time with. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4037.02s)]
*  You'll do personal Q&A with them. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4042.54s)]
*  And we'll set up a dinner either at the Abundance Summit in March of every year in LA, [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4046.6200000000003s)]
*  or we'll set up a dinner at the Platinum, our Abundance Platinum Longevity Trip. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4053.5800000000004s)]
*  Sound good? [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4058.94s)]
*  So far, yeah. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4060.06s)]
*  Okay. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4060.62s)]
*  Well, there's other things. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4062.14s)]
*  Okay, what else? [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4063.18s)]
*  Well, I think that the friends who get to know me personally like you have, [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4063.9s)]
*  we do spin out companies. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4067.26s)]
*  These age-reversal chemicals are going to be spun out soon. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4069.66s)]
*  They're going to be huge. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4073.18s)]
*  Cosmetic, hair, skin. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4073.9s)]
*  So Friends of Sinclair Lab will have burst right on the... [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4075.18s)]
*  Brilliant knowledge and a chance to get in as a seed investor. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4079.98s)]
*  Share with me in that. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4083.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4084.3s)]
*  I also think I've been lucky enough to get to know you. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4085.02s)]
*  I've been lucky enough to have spin outs myself. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4089.1s)]
*  So I'll also put in my $50,000. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4091.18s)]
*  So we've got $100,000 so far, guys. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4094.06s)]
*  So let's do it. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4097.34s)]
*  Because the future is too important to not let it happen in our lifetime. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4098.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, agreed. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4101.74s)]
*  I mean, we hold two different futures in superposition, [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4103.34s)]
*  and we have to choose which one we want. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4107.9s)]
*  Yeah, let's not be in the universe where things don't happen. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4111.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4115.099999999999s)]
*  Get us into that universe where we're just thriving as a species. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4115.58s)]
*  I love that. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4119.82s)]
*  I love that. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4120.38s)]
*  So please join me. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4121.0199999999995s)]
*  Please join David. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4122.38s)]
*  It'll be a blast. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4123.9s)]
*  I'll get a chance to spend more time with you. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4124.86s)]
*  I mean, this is a subject that just gives me such incredible hope. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4126.54s)]
*  This is the most exciting time ever to be in live. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4131.9s)]
*  And if you want more of it, [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4134.3s)]
*  we're going to make it happen right here, right now. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4136.46s)]
*  All right. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4138.38s)]
*  And can't wait to see who joins us on the Bitcoin, crypto and universe. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4138.86s)]
*  Well, I just want to make a comment about crypto in general. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4143.9s)]
*  I think we're in a new world. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4146.14s)]
*  We have a currency that will exist for thousands of years, [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4147.82s)]
*  and it's only going to go up. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4151.34s)]
*  First of all, I want to talk about the people that own crypto, [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4153.98s)]
*  the ones that I know, and Brian Armstrong is one of them. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4156.3s)]
*  They have the power to do big things, [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4160.7s)]
*  and they can come together as a community [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4162.62s)]
*  by either funding things or giving incentives to people to achieve greatness. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4164.86s)]
*  The other thing is, think about this, [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4169.58s)]
*  the currency is only going to go up, [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4171.820000000001s)]
*  and the longer you live, the more you're going to make. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4173.18s)]
*  But in general, I think that especially when it comes to Bitcoin, [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4176.22s)]
*  I think the people that own Bitcoin can really do great things with that. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4179.26s)]
*  It's an amazing currency. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4183.02s)]
*  I own some myself as well, [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4184.14s)]
*  which is what I'm going to use to donate here. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4186.700000000001s)]
*  I've seen this incredible correlation between people who love longevity, [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4190.14s)]
*  people who love Bitcoin. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4194.06s)]
*  For me, Bitcoin and Ethereum are my largest assets more than anything else. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4196.46s)]
*  And I do believe that we're going to have a world where as we're living [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4200.78s)]
*  past 100, maybe hundreds of years, [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4207.58s)]
*  having some asset that doesn't just vaporize and get taxed away to nothing is super important. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4209.98s)]
*  What's the killer of longevity assets? [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4217.259999999999s)]
*  It's inflation. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4219.5s)]
*  The cryptocurrency is a way to avoid that, [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4221.179999999999s)]
*  and it's only going to go up. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4223.74s)]
*  We can live a thousand years, we can go to other planets, [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4225.259999999999s)]
*  we can own crypto. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4227.58s)]
*  That's the future. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4228.78s)]
*  And we all have that one thing in common right now, [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4229.74s)]
*  aging as a disease and a common biology to solve. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4233.58s)]
*  We do. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4237.74s)]
*  We'll stay healthy for longer, [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4238.22s)]
*  but ultimately we have to be able to reverse aging if we're going to make it for a long time. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4239.9s)]
*  So while we work on it, let's stay healthy, [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4244.46s)]
*  but then let's just fund these research projects and make the future a reality. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4246.78s)]
*  David, I want to talk about another area, [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4250.94s)]
*  and then we're going to go to AMA questions. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4254.78s)]
*  I put out a tweet, I'm going to mute with David, what questions you have. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4257.34s)]
*  So we picked the top 20 or so that were provocative and fun. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4261.82s)]
*  But before we go there, I want to talk about what your longevity protocols are. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4265.58s)]
*  So what are you doing? [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4270.14s)]
*  I mean, honestly, you look great, dude. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4270.94s)]
*  And I appreciate the fact that you're a poster child for this industry. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4273.9s)]
*  Hey, thanks. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4278.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4279.18s)]
*  I went online, or at least my team did, [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4280.78s)]
*  and found something published at nad.com. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4284.06s)]
*  I'm not sure how real it is because I don't think it's, [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4287.820000000001s)]
*  they probably put it together from conversations you've had. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4291.820000000001s)]
*  I'll put the link in the show notes as well for folks if they want to see at least what was reported. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4295.02s)]
*  But let's run through these and tell me what's real, what's not real. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4302.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4307.02s)]
*  Okay. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4308.22s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4308.72s)]
*  You want to see the list here? [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4309.22s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4310.3s)]
*  Okay. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4311.1s)]
*  And what's the main thing? [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4312.38s)]
*  There's a laundry list here and I take like 80 supplements and meds a day. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4313.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4317.26s)]
*  Well, I do advise people on their longevity so that they get an insider look. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4317.820000000001s)]
*  But I'm happy to share some of the key things for everybody. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4322.700000000001s)]
*  I'm still on the standard stuff that was in, well, it's become standard. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4326.54s)]
*  In lifespan. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4330.14s)]
*  It wasn't standard when I published lifespan, but now it's become, [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4330.62s)]
*  you know, NMN has become a billion dollar industry now. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4333.740000000001s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4336.46s)]
*  I mean, honestly, due to you and just to clarify things, [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4337.1s)]
*  you're not backing any of these supplement companies. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4341.1s)]
*  In fact, they use your name and their likeness without your permission. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4345.02s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4347.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4348.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4349.34s)]
*  My lawyers spend a fair amount of time and my money on stopping that, [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4350.06s)]
*  but new companies pop up all the time, especially overseas. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4353.740000000001s)]
*  But yeah, I don't currently sell anything. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4357.18s)]
*  So the main things are, so let's start with the basics. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4362.06s)]
*  Do what you do. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4367.18s)]
*  So there's the saunas, there's the exercise. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4368.14s)]
*  Weightlifting is important, especially for men, or pilates for women, [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4371.820000000001s)]
*  a bit of weightlifting. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4375.42s)]
*  And then eating is important too. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4376.780000000001s)]
*  Serena is a trained nutritionist and chef and longevity expert. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4378.9400000000005s)]
*  She came in and changed my life too. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4383.02s)]
*  Four years ago, I stopped eating a lot of meat. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4384.62s)]
*  Have you gone vegan completely? [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4386.860000000001s)]
*  No, no. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4388.46s)]
*  90%? [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4389.02s)]
*  What would you say? [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4389.660000000001s)]
*  I'd say it's 90, 95. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4390.22s)]
*  I eat out and sometimes I break the rules for celebration purposes, [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4392.860000000001s)]
*  but I want to enjoy life. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4397.18s)]
*  But I'm definitely plant focused. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4399.900000000001s)]
*  And a few things happened when I switched to plants as my main diet. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4401.18s)]
*  I felt better. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4405.900000000001s)]
*  I could eat more, which was great because I love food. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4407.5s)]
*  And my mind cleared. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4410.780000000001s)]
*  And that might have also been because I gave up alcohol almost all of it. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4412.38s)]
*  Yeah. So just another point. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4415.42s)]
*  I have given up alcohol except for, you know, on a celebration. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4416.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4420.62s)]
*  Did you notice the difference? [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4421.12s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I'm so sensitive to alcohol. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4422.62s)]
*  It just makes me sleepy. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4424.700000000001s)]
*  And, you know, weight gain if I'm drinking too much. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4426.219999999999s)]
*  But I used to have like a little bit of wine now. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4430.94s)]
*  I'll taste some wine. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4433.5s)]
*  Tonight is an exception. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4434.3s)]
*  My deputy family, the Reese family is having the bar mitzvah of their son. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4436.219999999999s)]
*  And so my friend is like, I've got the best bottles of wine. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4440.62s)]
*  And so I was like, okay, I'm going to drink a glass of wine tonight. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4444.3s)]
*  Good. Well, you look like you're looking after your weight really well. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4447.0199999999995s)]
*  I am. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4450.38s)]
*  I think you've never looked so good. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4451.26s)]
*  But in terms of weight, gaining weight is a bad thing. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4452.62s)]
*  It puts our bodies into abundance mode. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4456.54s)]
*  I've talked before about abundance mode versus adversity mode. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4459.0199999999995s)]
*  We can have abundance mode occasionally. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4462.54s)]
*  You know, you can eat a steak. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4464.46s)]
*  You can eat a lot of food. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4465.58s)]
*  But for the majority of the time, you want to be in adversity mode. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4467.82s)]
*  So that's why I try not to eat more than two meals a day if I can. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4471.66s)]
*  Sometimes one. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4475.099999999999s)]
*  And the plants help because the plants seem to signal also to the body. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4476.3s)]
*  They're filled with polyphenols that also give the signal of adversity. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4480.86s)]
*  GLP-1s, let's just plug that in right here. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4485.0199999999995s)]
*  What's the evidence right now in your mind as a pro-longevity medication? [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4489.74s)]
*  Pretty good, actually. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4495.0199999999995s)]
*  Certainly if you're overweight, getting your weight down is nothing. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4495.9s)]
*  But in addition, someone like you and me, would it have longevity benefits? [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4498.46s)]
*  I think if it's used judiciously, I wouldn't use it chronically [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4502.94s)]
*  because there are some side effects, including muscle loss, [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4506.0599999999995s)]
*  but also some kidney and pancreas issues. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4508.46s)]
*  Potentially even blindness is a risk. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4511.1s)]
*  The disease that or the incident that we're going to treat next year [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4513.58s)]
*  with the age reversals called NION. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4518.06s)]
*  So that's non-ischemic, non-artoretic, ischemic optic neuropathy, NION. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4521.02s)]
*  The rates of that have doubled and tripled around the world because of these drugs. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4529.34s)]
*  So it's not without risk. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4533.1s)]
*  So you've got to be careful using these peptides. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4534.86s)]
*  But I think as a way to turn the body into a more adversity mode, they're excellent. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4538.46s)]
*  I have tried them, not to lose weight, but just to see how my blood work turned out. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4544.3s)]
*  And I saw some improvements. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4549.18s)]
*  I think with your doctor's advice and permission and counseling. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4550.3s)]
*  And there are many of these drugs at this point, right? [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4554.7s)]
*  Yeah, and they're getting easier to use. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4557.5s)]
*  So there's an oral version now. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4560.14s)]
*  I can see in the future that they'll be part of longevity programs. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4562.78s)]
*  But again, I'm not endorsing them. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4566.62s)]
*  I'm not saying you should definitely go do it. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4567.9s)]
*  And I think one of the things that's important to note, and I just again [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4569.5s)]
*  want to reinforce, if you're using a GLP-1 to lose weight, [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4574.7s)]
*  the challenge is you lose the weight, you also lose muscle. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4581.18s)]
*  And then when you stop the GLP-1, you just put on fat. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4585.42s)]
*  Again, you don't put the muscle back on. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4588.22s)]
*  That is an easy solution, right? [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4589.58s)]
*  Work out. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4590.86s)]
*  Yeah, you got to. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4591.5s)]
*  Keep working out. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4592.0599999999995s)]
*  There's some effort involved. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4592.62s)]
*  But just some sit-ups, push-ups and whatever. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4594.46s)]
*  And use the GLP-1 drug as a way to get into new habits. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4596.86s)]
*  Getting new habits of not eating as much or going to a... [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4603.98s)]
*  What meal do you miss if you're going to miss a meal? [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4608.38s)]
*  Breakfast. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4611.0199999999995s)]
*  Breakfast. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4611.5s)]
*  Yeah, and I have a late lunch. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4612.219999999999s)]
*  But the thing with GLP-1s is even if you were to just fast and stop eating as much, [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4614.86s)]
*  you are going to lose muscle mass. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4620.139999999999s)]
*  It's not just that the drugs are causing muscle loss. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4621.34s)]
*  It's what happens when you don't eat as much. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4623.74s)]
*  And so really, you do have to keep the muscle mass up. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4625.9800000000005s)]
*  And I wouldn't use testosterone alone to combat that muscle loss. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4628.78s)]
*  It really is better to be working out to stop that. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4632.9400000000005s)]
*  And clearly, you're a good example of that. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4635.9800000000005s)]
*  NMN, what source do you use? [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4640.14s)]
*  What sources are out there? [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4642.46s)]
*  Because I remember when Tony Robbins and I were writing our book, Life Force, [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4643.74s)]
*  when we looked at this, a lot of the NMN sources were not reputable out there. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4650.3s)]
*  And then, of course, a lot of companies have stopped putting NMN out for sale [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4656.78s)]
*  because of what's going on with Metrobiotech [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4663.5s)]
*  and the idea of having NMN become a medicine versus a supplement. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4667.18s)]
*  So give us some knowledge there. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4673.42s)]
*  Well, the first is about NMN as a supplement on, can you trust it? [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4676.54s)]
*  And I'm not in the business of testing products. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4681.18s)]
*  That's not what I do. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4684.62s)]
*  But I do test NMN sources when I give it to mice. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4685.98s)]
*  And we have a study that we're just revising showing NMN extends lifespan, [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4689.34s)]
*  mostly in female mice. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4693.1s)]
*  But it did improve frailty in a lot of health-related things. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4694.78s)]
*  So we do test NMN, and we've tested a bunch of them. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4698.22s)]
*  And we find that there are things in there that you wouldn't want in there like endotoxin, [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4703.02s)]
*  which is highly inflammatory parts of bacteria. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4708.06s)]
*  And so if you're going to... [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4711.34s)]
*  Have you published that data? [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4712.9400000000005s)]
*  No, I won't. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4715.26s)]
*  It's only... [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4715.820000000001s)]
*  We might publish it. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4718.9400000000005s)]
*  I mean, it's super useful. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4719.66s)]
*  We should do that. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4722.54s)]
*  I mean, somebody should be... [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4723.66s)]
*  Listen, you've made NMN a household name. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4727.18s)]
*  I guarantee the number of people... [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4730.38s)]
*  Well, whether you like it or not, because you talked about the value of this, [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4731.42s)]
*  you didn't do it to try and sell NMN. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4735.5s)]
*  You did this because you're talking about its impact on increasing NAD levels that are cellularly. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4737.5s)]
*  And I haven't made any money off it. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4743.740000000001s)]
*  In fact, I've invested a lot of money in clinical trials. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4745.1s)]
*  No, I mean, there's been like $30 million worth of my money and others to do clinical trials [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4749.42s)]
*  to test a version of NMN in humans. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4754.62s)]
*  It's cost me a lot to try and validate NMN as a molecule. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4757.5s)]
*  One of the advantages if Metrobiotech has a particular crystallized NMN [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4761.18s)]
*  that they're testing in a wide range of medical conditions, right? [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4767.9s)]
*  That's right. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4772.62s)]
*  And I don't see why they can't exist in the same universe. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4773.5s)]
*  That supplements which are not under FDA approval usually, [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4777.18s)]
*  they're not prescribed by doctors, [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4782.22s)]
*  but there's an ultra-pure pharmaceutical grade crystalline stable form [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4784.14s)]
*  that has been shown to work that can be prescribed. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4789.02s)]
*  That's been shown even for fish oil. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4792.38s)]
*  GSK actually, our friends at GSK made a fish oil. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4794.14s)]
*  I think it's still available on the market. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4797.42s)]
*  Yeah, and it's a pharmaceutical. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4799.02s)]
*  It's a drug. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4800.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4801.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4802.06s)]
*  Because of its purity. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4802.46s)]
*  It works. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4803.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4803.5s)]
*  And so, but the reason I would use the Metrobiotech NMN [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4804.54s)]
*  if and when it becomes approved as a drug is because I'm assured of quality [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4810.06s)]
*  and purity. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4813.66s)]
*  That's right. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4814.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4815.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4816.139999999999s)]
*  And then to get to the FDA thing, you know, I see on social media people [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4816.78s)]
*  accusing me of being the one to take off the market. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4820.78s)]
*  That's absolutely not true. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4822.86s)]
*  I think everybody should have access to it. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4824.3s)]
*  Otherwise, why would I talk about it? [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4825.9s)]
*  I do think though that there should be some better regulation on how pure this stuff is [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4828.22s)]
*  because there was a study that showed that, I think it was roughly half of them [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4834.46s)]
*  didn't have what was on the label. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4837.82s)]
*  And it degrades over time. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4839.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4841.099999999999s)]
*  In the non-crystalline form. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4841.58s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4842.78s)]
*  But what actually happened? [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4844.46s)]
*  I'll explain what actually happened. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4845.66s)]
*  Please. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4847.0199999999995s)]
*  So Metrobiotech, it's not my company. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4848.0599999999995s)]
*  I've invested in it and there's, you know, a chairman and a board. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4850.3s)]
*  And so they made the decision that they would support the FDA [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4853.82s)]
*  in looking at NMN as a supplement. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4858.94s)]
*  And there's a law that says if you're using a molecule in clinical trials, [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4863.099999999999s)]
*  it shouldn't be sold as a supplement to protect the $30 million investment [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4867.66s)]
*  that the people are putting in. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4873.259999999999s)]
*  I believe I'm on record. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4876.62s)]
*  I'll say here that I was not in favor of that. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4877.9s)]
*  I didn't want Metrobiotech to get involved with the FDA. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4881.099999999999s)]
*  That was not my decision. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4883.66s)]
*  But I don't run that company. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4885.179999999999s)]
*  There are very few companies that I actually have 100% control over. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4888.0599999999995s)]
*  But I am learning that it's better to have control of a company [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4891.66s)]
*  that you're the figurehead of. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4895.74s)]
*  But in this case, I couldn't stop that. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4897.98s)]
*  But I think where we're at now is that there's some gray zone about whether you can sell it now. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4900.14s)]
*  I'm seeing NMN for sale. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4905.34s)]
*  Let me clarify something. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4908.06s)]
*  So ultimately what you're trying to do is raise your intracellular NAD plus levels, [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4909.18s)]
*  your NAD levels. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4915.660000000001s)]
*  That's the end goal. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4916.54s)]
*  And the sirtuins need that NAD to work. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4917.34s)]
*  It's the powerhouse. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4919.660000000001s)]
*  So NMN can cross the cell membrane and inside the cell gets converted to NAD, correct? [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4921.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4929.18s)]
*  You know, academics will argue over everything. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4929.66s)]
*  I don't think it's still 100% agreed upon as to how NAD is made from NMN. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4932.06s)]
*  There's some work by Shinamai at Washington University that there's a transporter, [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4938.3s)]
*  even high up in the gut, that absorbs it into cells and through the gut membrane. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4943.5s)]
*  But there are people who say, oh, NMN has to be broken down first before it gets into NMN, NAD. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4949.1s)]
*  And then there's NR, nicotinamide robocide, which is... [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4954.22s)]
*  What's used to make NMN in the cell. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4957.42s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4959.82s)]
*  And so you have this sequence. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4960.38s)]
*  So some people are arguing that you should take NR. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4962.9400000000005s)]
*  Some people are going to take NMN. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4965.82s)]
*  Other folks are doing NAD IVs. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4967.74s)]
*  And am I wrong in believing that an NAD IV is not getting into your cell? [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4971.74s)]
*  Oh, I think that NAD drips will raise the intracellular NAD, [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4978.14s)]
*  probably because it gets broken down and then reabsorbed. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4982.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4985.42s)]
*  But the unfortunate thing with NAD drips, even though they're very popular, [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4985.82s)]
*  is that we still rely on anecdotal evidence that they do something. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4989.9s)]
*  And I would love to see some more studies on that. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4994.38s)]
*  But what I can say about oral NMN, we have spent money studying that. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=4996.94s)]
*  And when I say we, the scientists that conducted the study, [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5001.099999999999s)]
*  and I was one of the middle authors on that, [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5005.259999999999s)]
*  have shown that NMN in small groups of people improves blood pressure and cholesterol and [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5007.74s)]
*  lipids and even seems like it works on strength and endurance. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5013.98s)]
*  So in terms of living up to what we saw in mice, it is looking promising. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5018.459999999999s)]
*  And there are at least five clinical trials at Metrobiotech now [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5024.94s)]
*  looking at whether it's efficacious in a disease state. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5028.86s)]
*  Alzheimer's, kidney function, it's all on the website. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5032.62s)]
*  And so with five and hopefully six shots on goal, [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5035.74s)]
*  the idea is that one of those will work. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5039.98s)]
*  The other thing that's interesting is there's a new molecule that they saw that. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5041.74s)]
*  So MIB 626 was the old molecule. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5044.86s)]
*  Yeah, 626 is my birthday, by the way. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5047.42s)]
*  Ah, that's where it came from. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5049.34s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5050.86s)]
*  And then 725. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5051.34s)]
*  Almost happy birthday. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5052.54s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5053.5s)]
*  So 725 is the new molecule, MIB 725. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5054.78s)]
*  And that's the birthday of Anthony Sauve, [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5057.58s)]
*  my great colleague who passed away during COVID. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5060.7s)]
*  And he was at Cornell, but we miss him dearly. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5063.42s)]
*  And so hopefully if that makes it onto the market, it'll be his legacy. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5066.3s)]
*  Nice. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5070.78s)]
*  Quick aside, you probably heard me speaking about fountain life before. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5071.74s)]
*  And you're probably wishing, [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5075.179999999999s)]
*  Peter, would you please stop talking about fountain life? [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5076.38s)]
*  And the answer is no, I won't. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5078.94s)]
*  Because genuinely, we're living through a healthcare crisis. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5080.54s)]
*  You may not know this, but 70% of heart attacks have no precedence, [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5083.9s)]
*  no pain, no shortness of breath. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5087.179999999999s)]
*  And half of those people with a heart attack never wake up. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5089.26s)]
*  You don't feel cancer until stage three or stage four, until it's too late. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5091.82s)]
*  But we have all the technology required to detect and prevent [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5096.46s)]
*  these diseases early at scale. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5099.82s)]
*  That's why a group of us, including Tony Robbins, Bill Kapp, and Bob Haruri, [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5101.9s)]
*  founded Fountain Life, a one-stop center to help people understand [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5106.0599999999995s)]
*  what's going on inside their bodies before it's too late, [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5109.42s)]
*  and to gain access to the therapeutics to give them decades of extra health span. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5112.78s)]
*  Learn more about what's going on inside your body from Fountain Life. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5117.099999999999s)]
*  Go to fountainlife.com slash Peter and tell them Peter sent you. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5119.98s)]
*  Okay, back to the episode. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5124.299999999999s)]
*  All right, let's run down a few of these. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5126.219999999999s)]
*  So, Fisetin, Lepoic Acid, EPA, DHA, L-Torine. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5129.1s)]
*  Comments on those? [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5137.5s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, Fisetin is a molecule we actually first discovered [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5139.740000000001s)]
*  to be a longevity molecule before it was known as a senolytic. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5143.660000000001s)]
*  Yes, Fisetin and Corcetin together. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5147.9800000000005s)]
*  Although the people that now talk about Fisetin just ignore our research. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5150.38s)]
*  But that's how... [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5154.780000000001s)]
*  Is that the Australian pronunciation of it? [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5155.58s)]
*  Fisetin versus Fisetin? [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5158.38s)]
*  I think it doesn't matter what you say. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5161.1s)]
*  But we showed Fisetin is a sirtuin activator, just like resveratrol. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5164.62s)]
*  And so, I think it might be doing both things, [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5169.82s)]
*  is to either calm down or kill senescent cells at high doses, [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5172.3s)]
*  and at low doses, it activates the sirtuin enzyme, which is what we want. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5178.38s)]
*  Because I think of NAD as the gas or the petrol for the enzyme, [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5182.62s)]
*  and then the accelerator pedal are these polyphenols like Fisetin and resveratrol. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5186.7s)]
*  And together, they have a double whammy of benefit. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5190.86s)]
*  Lepoic Acid, I did a PhD on that when I was in Australia. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5194.46s)]
*  I've always liked it. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5198.7s)]
*  And then I started taking it about 15 years ago [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5201.34s)]
*  when I was introduced to one of my heroes, Denham Harmon, [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5203.5s)]
*  who came up with the free radical theory of aging, [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5207.9s)]
*  and he was still in the lab at 92. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5209.9s)]
*  And I said, what's your theory? What's your secret? [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5212.22s)]
*  And he said, it's alpha-Lepoic Acid. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5214.78s)]
*  Interesting. But the free radical theory of aging has really been kind of disproven, hasn't it? [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5216.22s)]
*  Yes, but I still admire him for being in the lab at 92. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5223.42s)]
*  Sure. But I mean, for those people who are thinking, [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5226.22s)]
*  oh, I need to be dealing with free radicals, [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5230.22s)]
*  that appears not to be one of the primary reasons of aging. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5233.42s)]
*  Well, indirectly it is because we know DNA breaks, so we're going to accelerate aging. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5237.26s)]
*  Sure. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5241.58s)]
*  And free radicals can damage DNA. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5242.54s)]
*  But it's not the holy grail. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5244.7s)]
*  Taking antioxidants doesn't extend the lifespan of animals very much. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5247.179999999999s)]
*  Okay. You mentioned L-Taurine just had a paper published on it. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5251.74s)]
*  Yeah, it just came out in Science. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5256.379999999999s)]
*  Rafael de Cabo is a very good friend of mine for 25 years. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5259.259999999999s)]
*  And he was the one that just showed that L-Taurine levels [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5264.219999999999s)]
*  don't decline apparently in humans or monkeys or mice. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5267.5s)]
*  Because that was like, you know, I started a year ago because of all the news about it. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5270.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5274.14s)]
*  It doesn't look as promising, put it that way. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5277.18s)]
*  And so I would say it's not going to hurt you. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5280.14s)]
*  But I think there's less likelihood that it's going to extend your lifespan. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5283.1s)]
*  By the way, NMN, one gram. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5286.78s)]
*  That's what I take. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5289.900000000001s)]
*  Is there any, if you do two grams or three grams, [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5290.54s)]
*  is there a problem with going more than a gram that you know of? [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5293.9800000000005s)]
*  Well. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5297.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm just curious. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5298.62s)]
*  Well, I always like to lean on data. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5299.42s)]
*  I have in a bunch of supplements, so I'm like, you know. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5300.86s)]
*  Well, it's published that both one gram and two gram have benefits. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5303.66s)]
*  And that one gram will double your NAD and two grams will roughly triple it on average. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5308.7s)]
*  But in my personal opinion now, I don't think it makes sense to go any higher. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5313.5s)]
*  Your body will just pee it out anyway and there's no point taking the risk. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5318.86s)]
*  But I know one gram and two grams seem to be safe in short-term human clinical trials. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5322.62s)]
*  Got it. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5327.9800000000005s)]
*  We've talked about resveratrol, spermidine, vitamin D, vitamin K. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5329.42s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5334.38s)]
*  Okay. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5335.58s)]
*  Low dose aspirin? [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5336.7s)]
*  Still, yes. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5338.3s)]
*  Okay. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5339.02s)]
*  And that's interesting because a lot of people have [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5339.42s)]
*  heard, at least through the grapevine, that aspirin shouldn't be taken. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5341.82s)]
*  So here's the deal. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5344.9400000000005s)]
*  And when, you know, I actually read the papers. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5346.38s)]
*  I don't just read Twitter. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5348.22s)]
*  When you go into the literature, the reason that doctors are mostly against aspirin these days [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5352.3s)]
*  is that they're balancing the risk reward. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5357.98s)]
*  Now the reward is prevention of clots and cardiovascular risk. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5360.94s)]
*  Now the risk is that you get stomach bleeding. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5365.099999999999s)]
*  And based on the numbers, it wasn't clear if it was worth taking aspirin with the risk. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5367.66s)]
*  But that's for the average human and there is no such thing as an average human. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5374.86s)]
*  So really medicine should be breaking it down as to for you, Peter, what's good for you? [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5379.099999999999s)]
*  Do you want an aspirin or not? [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5383.66s)]
*  And by the way, everything we've spoken about so far, I do take including aspirin. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5385.42s)]
*  Oh, 81 milligrams a day. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5390.219999999999s)]
*  81 milligrams, all right, baby aspirin. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5391.66s)]
*  So take a coated one. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5393.58s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5394.86s)]
*  Yep. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5395.5s)]
*  So that reduces the risk of any stomach issues. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5396.0599999999995s)]
*  But here's the thing, that there are people at risk of cardiovascular disease and then [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5398.7s)]
*  it does make sense for them to take an aspirin. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5402.3s)]
*  It makes perfect sense for me to take it because I genetically have high levels of Lp little a. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5405.34s)]
*  I do too. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5409.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5410.38s)]
*  By the way, I'm so excited about the new drug that's coming out for Lp little a. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5410.7s)]
*  Yeah, it looks promising. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5413.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5414.7s)]
*  It just it's in phase three. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5414.94s)]
*  It should be coming out in like the next 12 months. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5416.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5419.0199999999995s)]
*  I mean, because right now, you know, it's there's very little that moves the needle there. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5419.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's really hard to bring it down. I know from experience. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5425.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you and I are in the same boat. Try methylglycine. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5427.74s)]
*  I don't take that. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5431.66s)]
*  Either do I? [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5433.099999999999s)]
*  No. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5434.0599999999995s)]
*  Okay. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5434.219999999999s)]
*  There's this unfounded claim that NMN and NAD boosters deplete your methyls and that you need [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5435.5s)]
*  to take this to supplement it. That's just based on wild speculation. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5442.86s)]
*  There's no evidence from anything we've done that that's true. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5445.66s)]
*  So I stopped taking metformin. Are you on it still? [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5448.62s)]
*  Occasionally. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5453.0199999999995s)]
*  Occasionally. Okay. I'm on berberine instead. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5453.98s)]
*  Me too. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5456.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5457.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Now I found that metformin was really rough on my stomach and the older I get, I find it's [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5457.66s)]
*  rougher, but berberine seems to be great. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5462.54s)]
*  I stopped metformin mostly for the focus on muscle growth. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5465.9s)]
*  Yeah, there's that, but also I want to speak about that. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5470.86s)]
*  Please. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5473.66s)]
*  Because I find that most people don't read the papers. And if you do, what you see is that [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5474.299999999999s)]
*  this claim, even from some doctors who talk about this, is that it blunts muscle growth. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5479.099999999999s)]
*  And when you actually dive into the data, you see that the graph was misrepresented. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5486.459999999999s)]
*  Wow. Guilty as charged. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5491.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Well, the one thing you should never do as a scientist is cut the y-axis off [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5493.339999999999s)]
*  and exaggerate the difference. But that's what they did. It's only a five percent. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5497.66s)]
*  Why? [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5501.66s)]
*  Just looks better. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5502.7s)]
*  All right. Let's go to the next one, ripamycin. So huge claims. I mean, many longevity experts [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5505.0199999999995s)]
*  said, okay, if there's one drug that probably has longevity impact, it's ripamycin. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5512.62s)]
*  And I've been tracking that. I've been reading on it. And it's enough up in doubt where I [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5518.86s)]
*  stopped taking ripamycin. I have a very low senile cell count. How about you? What do you [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5528.139999999999s)]
*  think about ripamycin? [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5534.86s)]
*  I'm less excited about it. It was the darling because it works really well on inbred animals [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5536.78s)]
*  and seemingly might even work in dogs. But in humans, there was a study that came out. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5542.22s)]
*  It was probably six months ago that compared the effect on the epigenetic age of people [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5549.9800000000005s)]
*  in different clinical trials. And while some things worked really well, like Clark restriction, [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5556.780000000001s)]
*  what else was important? I think a carbo worked really well, metformin looked [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5563.740000000001s)]
*  better than I thought it would. Rappamycin had no effect on the age of the epigenome. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5567.98s)]
*  And so that combined with the known potential risks of down regulating the immune system. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5573.0199999999995s)]
*  Let me explain later why I think that that's bad. I decided only to take it rarely. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5579.419999999999s)]
*  What occasion would you take it on? [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5585.419999999999s)]
*  I'd probably take it four times a year. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5586.86s)]
*  Okay. So just pulsed. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5588.459999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And I'm monitoring myself. So I know if it has benefits or not. And I do see some. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5589.82s)]
*  You're monitoring your immune system? You're monitoring? [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5595.419999999999s)]
*  Everything. Yeah. I monitor my immune system. I'm counting the cells that I have, the different [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5597.66s)]
*  types and cytokines, inflammatory cytokines. And I want to keep those as low as possible, [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5601.58s)]
*  keep down inflammation, inflammation aging. So I want to talk about why [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5606.22s)]
*  down regulating your immune system might be bad. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5610.94s)]
*  Yes. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5613.42s)]
*  Now you want to down regulate your inflammation, but you want to have some really active immune [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5613.9s)]
*  system when it comes to cancer and viruses. And those two things are real risks as we get older. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5617.9s)]
*  There are endogenous viruses that come out like CMV and CMV is pernicious. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5625.5s)]
*  It's an epidemic out there. I mean, one thing that people don't realize is there's something [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5634.38s)]
*  called immunoexhaustion, right? Where your immune system is fighting all these battles [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5638.46s)]
*  against herpes, against CMV, against how many different viruses do you think are endemic in [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5643.66s)]
*  the human being on average? [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5648.54s)]
*  It's approaching a thousand now when you do deep sequencing. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5651.02s)]
*  Incredible. And if they're fighting those viruses, your innate system is not there to fight cancer. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5655.18s)]
*  Yes, there's that. And the other issue is that these viruses like CMV, they lead to autoimmune [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5662.86s)]
*  disorders potentially, like CMV is linked to multiple sclerosis now. And so you do not want [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5669.66s)]
*  CMV circulating. And for that reason, I don't want chronic down regulation of my immune system. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5675.42s)]
*  Let's jump into a few other elements here. So thank you for that. Is there anything else [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5686.7s)]
*  that we didn't talk about that's high in your supplement med list? [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5691.18s)]
*  Oh, there's a lot. Lots, but let's leave that for the friends. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5694.22s)]
*  So maybe the friends of Sinclair Lab will have a deeper dive. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5696.7s)]
*  And Book 2. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5699.9s)]
*  Okay. By the way, for those who are fans of David's first book, Lifespan, which I probably [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5701.34s)]
*  recommend more than my books, his next one coming out in 2026 is called Lifespan Survival. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5708.38s)]
*  So can't wait. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5716.06s)]
*  Thanks. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5717.82s)]
*  All right. So are there any special supplements or additions for women that you want to call out? [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5718.78s)]
*  Oh, gee. Well, that's a whole separate category. And Serena, my partner, is an expert in that. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5725.66s)]
*  I usually defer to her. And I don't want to claim to be an expert on female hormone therapy, [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5731.74s)]
*  but I do believe that hormone therapy is anti-aging. We see that in the literature. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5737.259999999999s)]
*  And also there are some ways to delay menopause and perhaps even reverse it. And I talk about that [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5743.0199999999995s)]
*  in my book as well. So I think mostly for women, it's hormonal, but there's other things like iron [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5747.9s)]
*  protein that they need certain times of the month as well. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5753.82s)]
*  Do you know Jennifer Garrison at the Buck? [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5756.299999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5757.9s)]
*  Yeah. So Jennifer is another place that Tony and I have supported her research. And [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5758.299999999999s)]
*  she was at XPRIZE Visioneering last October. And that's where we compete on all these XPRIZE ideas. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5766.62s)]
*  And her work in what was being called the double XPRIZE for women's longevity, [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5773.42s)]
*  and particularly ovarian longevity, won the competition. So in the middle of designing [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5781.1s)]
*  that XPRIZE, which will be super cool. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5786.3s)]
*  Well, she's great. I have a superstar in my lab who, by the way, needs our support. Maria, [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5788.700000000001s)]
*  she's such a superstar. This morning she gave lab meetings. So our lab meetings go for three hours [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5797.1s)]
*  on Friday mornings. And she outlined her project to use these age reversal breakthroughs on women's [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5801.1s)]
*  fertility. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5809.98s)]
*  Well, we need to get her either competing for the prize or helping to design the prize, for sure. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5810.62s)]
*  Yeah. She's also, by the way, using menstrual fluid as a biological clock and diagnostic [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5815.259999999999s)]
*  factor, which is a great idea. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5820.86s)]
*  Amazing. So sauna, do you sauna? [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5823.0199999999995s)]
*  As much as I can. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5827.9s)]
*  I just purchased something called the Healing Sauna. It is a deep infrared sauna. It's [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5829.66s)]
*  relatively small, about yay big. It's got a chair in the middle, and it zips up around you with your [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5837.26s)]
*  head sticking out the top, and you have two arm slots. So I get in the morning, I'm on my [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5844.78s)]
*  computer doing my email, and in about 30 minutes I get a great sweat. And you don't want to sweat [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5850.3s)]
*  too much. You want to sweat enough to get the toxins out, but not so much that you start [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5858.46s)]
*  losing other vital. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5863.26s)]
*  Right. And turn on the heat shock proteins in your skin and maybe deeper. Yeah, that's [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5864.46s)]
*  all important. And the science for sauna now is irrefutable. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5868.38s)]
*  It is. It's a couple of thousand dollars for this thing, and it fits anywhere. So if you [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5872.86s)]
*  want to increase your, it's super easy. And I actually, I love it. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5877.82s)]
*  I might look into that because often the problem is we don't have space in our houses. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5882.86s)]
*  And this actually, it is. It's like the size of this table. It's no bigger. And it collapses. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5888.06s)]
*  And again, you sit in a folding chair inside and the elements are inside and you basically [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5893.98s)]
*  zip this thing around your neck. It's got a frame and it works. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5901.259999999999s)]
*  Does it get hot enough? [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5904.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I get a really great sweat going in 30 minutes. It's not like instantly like 10 [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5905.259999999999s)]
*  minutes, but I enjoy my 30 minutes. I'm meditating or I'm watching a video, listen to a book. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5910.86s)]
*  Nice. What's it called again? [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5917.82s)]
*  It's called a healing sauna. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5918.78s)]
*  Healing sauna. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5919.82s)]
*  Yeah. I think it's just healingsauna.com. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5920.459999999999s)]
*  Okay. So one big question is fasting and fasting mimicking diet. So when I looked into it, [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5922.54s)]
*  there was a lot of confusion about whether fasting actually moved the needle for humans. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5932.54s)]
*  What do you think about it? [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5939.26s)]
*  I know a lot about it. In particular, I was just recording my next podcast [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5941.34s)]
*  and it is on fasting and chloride restriction. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5945.5s)]
*  And there's 80 pages of notes. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5948.62s)]
*  Wow. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5950.22s)]
*  So yeah, so you have to do fasting the right way. There's with all these diets, [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5951.9800000000005s)]
*  if you do it the wrong way, it can harm you, right? But you need to be educated. You need [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5958.46s)]
*  to make sure you're not overdoing it and you're supplying yourself with enough vitamins, minerals, [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5962.3s)]
*  and protein. And so yeah, I do it, but I do it in a scientific way. And that's part of the [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5967.740000000001s)]
*  challenge. If you don't do it without having regular blood tests, at least once every few [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5974.3s)]
*  months, I think it's somewhat risky. But in general, fasting has been shown forever, [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5978.22s)]
*  since humans were first around. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5985.66s)]
*  In fact, religions have built in fasting into their annual clock. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5987.02s)]
*  Yeah. So I still believe in the science of fasting and it just has to be done the right way. And [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=5992.9400000000005s)]
*  actually there are some papers that show that if you do a vegan diet, this is just separate, [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6000.06s)]
*  but in a good example, a vegan unhealthy diet will make you live shorter, but a vegan healthy [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6006.22s)]
*  diet will make you live longer. You just got to make sure you're eating the right things. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6010.7s)]
*  And the same with fasting. You got to time it with your circadian rhythms. You got to eat the right [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6014.22s)]
*  food at the right time. You can't just eat french fries once a day and hope that's going to make [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6018.38s)]
*  you live longer. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6022.62s)]
*  So I'm very vocal about the notion that sugar is a poison. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6023.34s)]
*  Me too. I regard it as a poison. Yeah. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6028.06s)]
*  I just want to echo. So a couple of data points here. We are eating in our diet today, [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6031.58s)]
*  if you look at the numbers, on the order of 10 times more sugar than we did a couple of years ago. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6036.7s)]
*  And one of the things we just are getting ready to publish this data at FountainLife. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6042.78s)]
*  So everybody coming through FountainLife, we upload them. We get 200 gigabytes of data. It's [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6048.46s)]
*  like one of the most complete data uploads you could possibly do in five hours, full body MRI, [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6052.78s)]
*  brain, brain vasculature, coronary CT, looking for soft plaque, not calcified plaque. Soft plaque [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6057.74s)]
*  is what kills you these days. And if you have a high calcium score, it doesn't mean much unless [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6066.139999999999s)]
*  the calcium is blocking your coronary artery. If it's cement on the side of the walls, it's stable, [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6071.42s)]
*  but it's the soft plaque that could evolve in the middle of the night, block your artery, [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6076.46s)]
*  and you don't wake up. We do low dose lung CT. We do DEXA scan, metabolomics, [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6081.0199999999995s)]
*  140 blood biomarkers, your gut microbiome, retinal scan, skin scan, all of that. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6087.42s)]
*  When am I going to get a scan? Dude, please come, please. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6095.58s)]
*  I'm just teasing. No, I'm serious. No, please come. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6098.78s)]
*  I'd love to try it. And as my guest, we're opening up LA here in the first quarter of 26. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6100.9400000000005s)]
*  And of course, we're operational in Dallas today. We're opening up Houston before the end of this [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6108.3s)]
*  year. We have New York going, Orlando and Naples going and opening up Miami. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6113.74s)]
*  Congratulations. Thank you. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6122.78s)]
*  Yeah, really. I remember when you were just talking about it. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6123.82s)]
*  We looked at what correlates highest with heart disease. And it wasn't [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6126.3s)]
*  Lp little a or triglycerides or LDL or HDL. It was your hemoglobin A1c. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6133.26s)]
*  Right. And I mean, it's like, you can control that. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6139.339999999999s)]
*  Well, you can. And it starts with good diet and lifestyle and exercise for sure. But the drugs [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6143.82s)]
*  now that are available, you can either prevent the absorption with a carbo. You can pee it out with [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6151.179999999999s)]
*  this DLT2 inhibitors. You can take metformin or berberine. And then there's others. And so yeah, [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6156.86s)]
*  if you've got a good physician, you should be able to control your blood glucose these days. Of [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6164.219999999999s)]
*  course, the JLP ones shouldn't forget. It's crazy. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6167.9s)]
*  OK, one or two more subjects. I want to go into the AMA. We have so many fans of yours that have [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6172.86s)]
*  written out questions here. I just got back from Hong Kong. And one of the things that I was [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6178.46s)]
*  speaking about there was the notion that a breakthrough in China works in Chicago. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6185.98s)]
*  You know, a breakthrough in Boston works in Beijing. You know, we all share, all a billion [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6194.06s)]
*  of us share the same fundamentals of longevity. And so unlike AI, which is a battle sort of [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6199.26s)]
*  winner take all, you know, the idea of being able to give people longevity is something that [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6206.3s)]
*  is a rising tide for everybody. I'm curious where, you know, so when I run my platinum [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6212.9400000000005s)]
*  longevity trips, we're currently doing them one year on, even years we're in San Francisco [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6220.46s)]
*  and San Diego, which is sort of a cluster for longevity. And then on odd years like this year, [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6228.78s)]
*  we'll be visiting you and George and a number of other incredible people in Boston, Cambridge, [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6233.66s)]
*  and Dean Kamens in New Hampshire, which is another cluster, if you would. What's going on in the rest [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6239.74s)]
*  of the world? Who, what's hot? Where are the clusters of longevity work? [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6246.86s)]
*  Well, there are nations that have stood up and said, we're going to invest in this. And so [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6251.66s)]
*  in Asia, it's Singapore, in the Middle East, pretty much all the countries, but Saudi Arabia, UAE, [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6258.54s)]
*  and now Qatar are big on longevity. And then it's just distant third and fourth and fifth. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6265.58s)]
*  The Western world is not really getting into it besides the US. It's a little bit in the UK, [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6273.82s)]
*  a little bit in Australia. But other than that, it's just pockets of really good labs, [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6279.98s)]
*  but not really an industry yet. I wish that in the same way we just saw [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6284.219999999999s)]
*  a couple of trillion dollars put into AI by the Middle East, that they would get longevity [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6291.099999999999s)]
*  religion. I mean, it's, you know, and start pouring trillions into this space. And I hope [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6298.78s)]
*  we can get there. I hope we can get there because I do finally believe this is, you know, you've [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6305.66s)]
*  spoken about this. You've been really the first person to speak out that aging is a disease, [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6312.46s)]
*  that when we're able to cure and reverse this, it is going to uplift every society. And God knows [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6318.139999999999s)]
*  that South Korea, Japan, China, Italy, most of Western Europe need longevity. They're [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6325.98s)]
*  disappearing as nations. Yeah. Well, that's the other thing. It used to be that we're going to [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6335.179999999999s)]
*  overcrowd the planet if we are slow down aging, but we need the current existing people to stay [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6339.5s)]
*  healthy and productive because they're running out of people. Are we seeing good work coming out of [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6345.0199999999995s)]
*  out of China as an area? Do you know that? Are there scientists? I'm just, [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6352.14s)]
*  I'm curious what's going on there. They are more than a decade behind the US right now, [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6356.62s)]
*  but we're ceding to them right now. We're cutting our science by more than half and [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6361.9800000000005s)]
*  yeah, oh my God, all that stuff. So I think China is laughing all the way to the IP patent office. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6366.54s)]
*  And we really risk our lead in this area. And, you know, while AI is neck and neck, [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6373.42s)]
*  we have a big lead in longevity, but we could lose that. Yeah, for sure. All right. Let's jump [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6380.22s)]
*  into questions from your fans. So the first one was what role is AI playing in your search [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6385.34s)]
*  to reverse aging? We heard about that already. A very big role. Yeah. A big role. When did it [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6391.42s)]
*  start becoming a big role in your lab? We started using it about three years ago, [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6397.1s)]
*  but now we don't go a day without it. And think about this, that what we do now in two months [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6404.78s)]
*  would have taken thousands of years to do. You can say it, but just let that sink in. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6413.0199999999995s)]
*  The predictions that I made five years ago are out the window because of AI. Now I'm much more [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6420.78s)]
*  optimistic. So the new book is going to update those predictions. Exactly. Yes. Okay. Fantastic. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6427.0199999999995s)]
*  At Safia 3000 says, is there a role for epigenetic reprogramming to end ovarian aging [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6431.5s)]
*  and restore ovarian function? Maria will answer that in my lab, PhD student. So yes, we do believe [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6438.3s)]
*  that we can reverse ovarian aging. We already were the first group with our Australian offshoot to [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6445.42s)]
*  show that you can reverse infertility in old mice. That was a shocker because people said, oh, [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6451.74s)]
*  mammals run out of eggs, right? But we took 16 month old mice, which had become infertile [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6458.06s)]
*  six months earlier and reversed them and made them produce pups again. I know it's possible, [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6463.18s)]
*  even with NMN, it worked. So we're going to try the even better technology, the stronger technology, [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6469.02s)]
*  the epigenetic reprogramming. Incredible. And most men are very ignorant about ovarian aging. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6475.26s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, just to pass along some facts for folks, something like only [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6485.02s)]
*  five or six species on the planet go through menopause. It's three species of whales, [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6492.14s)]
*  norwhal and humans, which is crazy. You'd imagine everybody does, but no, that's not the case. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6499.26s)]
*  And if you're a guy, the age at which your sister went through menopause actually correlates with [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6505.34s)]
*  how long you'll live. Right. It's really a good indicator of longevity. Fascinating. All right. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6511.74s)]
*  At Glenn Orgen asks, how close are we to making partial cellular reprogramming safe and scalable [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6518.7s)]
*  for human use? What's your current stance on NAD plus boosters? Are NMN, NR and IV NAD plus still [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6525.179999999999s)]
*  viable? Or is there a next evolutionary evolution emerging? Is gene therapy still your most promising [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6532.219999999999s)]
*  delivery method for Yamanakas? We've sort of covered many of those. I don't know if you want to [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6538.7s)]
*  add anything on there. That was a very long question. Yeah. But testing your memory. Yeah, [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6543.099999999999s)]
*  it really is. I think we're very close. We'll go into our first humans. Hopefully, by this time next [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6549.74s)]
*  year, we might know if it works. From then on, it's probably a year or two before we do whole body [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6555.179999999999s)]
*  rejuvenation. I love it. If that works, imagine. I mean, it's just, it feels like it's science [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6560.86s)]
*  fiction. It feels like it's the future. It's like we're living in the Star Trek universe with [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6565.42s)]
*  AI at this level and talking about whole body rejuvenation. I mean, what an extraordinary time [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6571.18s)]
*  to be alive. It is. It is. The future looks so bright. We have to make it happen. Yeah, we [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6576.3s)]
*  absolutely have to. So, at Ethore, Arnaulds asks, when can we expect results on human trials of [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6583.66s)]
*  OSK Yamanaka factors? I think you've answered that. We're going to see human trials. This is the [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6592.7s)]
*  life biosciences work. Starting in January. Yep. Okay. Atnik Singh wants to know when is your next [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6600.46s)]
*  book coming out? We shared that. So, it's 2026 and it's called Lifespan Survival. I'll tell you what [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6609.82s)]
*  it's about. Please. Yeah, I love that. So, Lifespan was more of a textbook. It was, why do we age? [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6616.46s)]
*  And how does this all work? And what will happen to the planet when this happens? Book two is really [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6621.98s)]
*  answering all the questions that I've been getting since. And it's, so think of Lifespan Two, the book [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6627.099999999999s)]
*  as the guidebook. How do we optimize our bodies looking at our evolution, the genes that we all [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6632.54s)]
*  carry? How do we individualize our lifestyle, supplements, medicines to maximize our longevity? [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6637.98s)]
*  And then what do we do for the next 10, 20 years going forward? And I look at it from the individual [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6643.5s)]
*  perspective at the molecular level all the way through to society. Fantastic. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6650.06s)]
*  Dana Brilliant writes, what's your exercise routine? How much protein do you eat? Okay. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6655.9800000000005s)]
*  Her name was Brilliant. I like that. So, the routine is whenever I can, I get to the gym. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6664.14s)]
*  And often I'm on planes, so it's hard to work out on planes. But the, I think it's very important [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6670.14s)]
*  a few times a week to get to the gym or at least at home have something, some weights you can lift. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6675.5s)]
*  And then walk around on a treadmill, moving, moving, moving and keeping, especially after the [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6680.38s)]
*  age of 50, you got to keep lifting weights, otherwise you're going to lose it. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6685.34s)]
*  Smoking is the new, I mean, sitting is the new smoking is I like to say. And for me, the tricks [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6688.38s)]
*  are, I have a stationary bike. I take my Zoom meetings on my stationary bike. It works well. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6693.34s)]
*  Yeah. So, if you've ever been on a Zoom meeting with me, it looks like I'm in space because I'm [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6701.26s)]
*  standing, but I'm moving all the time. And so, yeah, I don't sit down during the day. I try not [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6705.5s)]
*  to at least. So, that's one trick. Protein, I eat a lot of protein, but it's mostly plant-based. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6711.42s)]
*  Sure. So, you know, for me, I put on 10 pounds of muscle mass about two years ago, 18 months ago, [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6718.54s)]
*  and my job is keep it on now. And it was creatine. Do you take creatine as a supplement? [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6724.46s)]
*  No, but I'm considering it. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6729.9s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, it looks like all upside, no downside for me. So, I do five grams of creatine. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6731.58s)]
*  And it was one gram of protein per pound of body weight. And there's a lot of debate on how much [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6736.22s)]
*  protein. Our friend down the street here at UCLA is not liking so much protein. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6745.34s)]
*  Well, I tend to like that. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6754.3s)]
*  Walter Longo. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6755.42s)]
*  Yeah, that's Walter. And also Dudley Lamming is my ex-student. He's now a professor. And he's done [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6756.78s)]
*  some of the most work on looking at amino acids and how they affect longevity. And there are some [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6762.54s)]
*  really good amino acids and there are some that will reduce your lifespan. And there are what's [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6767.099999999999s)]
*  called branch chain amino acids, leucine, isoleucine, valine, that are the bad ones. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6771.82s)]
*  And you get a lot of that from meat. So, I try not to eat a lot of meat. Plants have less of [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6776.78s)]
*  these amino acids. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6780.94s)]
*  What's your favorite protein source from plants? [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6781.5s)]
*  Lentils. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6784.94s)]
*  Lentils. I love lentils. Yes. Okay. Aoko Nova One asks, Dr. David Sinclair, what single experiment [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6785.42s)]
*  would you definitely falsify your epigenetic noise? What experiment would falsify your [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6795.82s)]
*  epigenetic noise theory of aging? Is there something that if you ran it would disprove that [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6802.78s)]
*  theory? [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6808.14s)]
*  Oh, yeah. It's easy to disprove a theory. It's much harder to prove it. Lots of things could [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6808.46s)]
*  disprove it. For example, the ice mice, if we had accelerated the epigenome aging, so changing the [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6815.02s)]
*  methylation pattern and the gene expression, and those mice were normal and didn't look old, [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6821.42s)]
*  then I would have thrown out the theory. But they did look old. And that was the reason that I [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6826.780000000001s)]
*  thought it's likely to be true because the chances that it would fail were 99%. But that 1% it worked. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6832.14s)]
*  Wow. All right. At Good To Think With asks, what AI advancement would be the most useful for your [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6839.82s)]
*  research? [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6846.62s)]
*  Oh, that's great. I would love if AI could tell me who the observer is, where the observer is. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6847.74s)]
*  We've been working on that, but would love it if they said, we just analyzed all the world's data [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6854.0599999999995s)]
*  and it's got to be this result. That would help. That's my dream is before I die to figure out how [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6858.3s)]
*  is the cell rejuvenated. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6866.0599999999995s)]
*  And have the AI publish the paper for you as well. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6867.259999999999s)]
*  Well, that's almost doable now. But I think that also being able to do drug development [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6870.94s)]
*  even better than we do now, to be able to say this one molecule is your candidate for going [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6877.099999999999s)]
*  into humans would be amazing. We're not there yet. It says top 100, but going down to one. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6883.98s)]
*  And like you said, having a digital twin and being able to simulate the interaction with all [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6889.339999999999s)]
*  the proteins in the body and say, okay, that one's probably going to be toxic, but this one will [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6893.9s)]
*  work. We're probably only a few years away from that. And eventually you'll just do it on your [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6897.82s)]
*  phone. We'll talk about, oh, let's cure whatever disease on your phone. By the time you get home, [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6903.98s)]
*  it's told you how to do that. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6908.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. I love that. I have a question that pops in mind here. There's a crazy statistic about the [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6910.139999999999s)]
*  non-reproducibility of research data. I mean, is it like half of the research out there? I'm [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6916.78s)]
*  not sure if it's that high, but can't be reproduced. What's going on there? [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6923.98s)]
*  Yeah. That number is an exaggeration. We sometimes struggle to reproduce people's data. And it's [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6928.78s)]
*  because you're using a different cell line, different water supply, it's different handler, [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6934.54s)]
*  the mice don't behave the same way. So it's not that the people are faking it. It's more that [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6940.0599999999995s)]
*  science is complicated and variable and depends on where and how you do it. And some labs rejoice [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6945.02s)]
*  in disproving things. I don't do that. I always assume I'm the one that it's not working. I don't [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6950.14s)]
*  know the reason it's not working. But there are labs that thrive on not reproducing people's data. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6955.1s)]
*  And it's super easy to not reproduce someone's result. I could easily do it, just change one [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6960.06s)]
*  thing and it's not going to work. So there's that category. But of course, there's a lot of research [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6964.22s)]
*  that isn't done rigorously like this Turing paper. It might've been due to just inherent variability [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6968.14s)]
*  taking one time point. But when you look over the lifespan of longitudinal same humans, [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6973.58s)]
*  you do see it. So sometimes there's some bad science, but I think that number is exaggerated. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6978.62s)]
*  I'm very happy to say that none of our papers have ever been disproved or had to be retracted or [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6984.38s)]
*  change their conclusions. I stand behind my scientific record. And we work really hard to [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6988.62s)]
*  make sure that everything we do is very reproducible. In fact, we don't publish something unless [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6993.26s)]
*  our lab and another lab can reproduce it. That's super high standards. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=6998.54s)]
*  Okay, at Robert ZX writes, what one area do you want to see more innovative startups tackling? [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7003.58s)]
*  Is there something that... [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7011.58s)]
*  In longevity or... [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7012.7s)]
*  I assume so in the biotech longevity world is... [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7013.66s)]
*  I would love more labs to be working on finding new ways to reverse aging. Right now we have [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7016.38s)]
*  three genes that we know work. That's our technology. And we have some small molecules [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7025.0199999999995s)]
*  working on, but then it's all white space for people to get into. We do have some competition, [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7029.82s)]
*  right? We've got Altos and the others. But I think that this area is similar to AI. There's just [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7035.74s)]
*  there's so much that can be done. And it's not like one company is going to win everything. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7043.58s)]
*  If you're talking about potentially being able to treat and or cure most diseases, [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7048.219999999999s)]
*  you could have hundreds of companies being very successful in this area. And I would like to see [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7054.62s)]
*  more jump in. One of our mutual friends, Dr. Zevronkov from Insilico Medicine, has built an [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7058.38s)]
*  amazing lab that is AI and robotic driven. So the AI proposes the experiment, the robots run the [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7066.9400000000005s)]
*  experiment overnight, get the data, iterate on the theory and so forth. Does anything like that exist [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7074.54s)]
*  in Boston right now? I'm not aware of it. But that sounds... [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7081.5s)]
*  That's the future for sure. Alex is onto it. Yeah, I think that humans will just play a [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7086.78s)]
*  minor supervisory role in the future of drug development. Now, right now, we humans are more [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7091.099999999999s)]
*  creative than AI. We can imagine things that AI cannot, but that is only a few years from being [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7096.62s)]
*  superseded by AI that can have an imagination just like ours. I, by the way, actually, I believe that [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7104.139999999999s)]
*  we're going to see consciousness in these machines. And I just tweeted out, because I just [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7110.219999999999s)]
*  finished listening to a book about the evolution of intelligence, which Max Bennett, I think, is [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7115.42s)]
*  the author. And it's a great book. And he talks about how we evolved our intelligence. And it [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7122.46s)]
*  starts with language, by the way, which now we're doing LLMs. So early stages of human evolution [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7127.66s)]
*  over the last million years. But there's not that many steps that between once you've got language [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7133.74s)]
*  to becoming sentient, almost a given. Wow. I'm about to go on a two week vacation to [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7139.26s)]
*  Alaska with my family. And I was looking for a book to read. I think you just found it for me. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7144.86s)]
*  You remember the title of it? I think it is the evolution of intelligence. Fantastic. Oh, [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7148.299999999999s)]
*  it might be a brief history of intelligence. Every day, I get the strangest compliment. Someone will [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7152.0599999999995s)]
*  stop me and say, Peter, you have such nice skin. Honestly, I never thought I'd hear that from anyone. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7156.94s)]
*  And honestly, I can't take the full credit. All I do is use something called OneSkin OS1 twice a day, [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7163.099999999999s)]
*  The company is built by four brilliant PhD women who identified a peptide that effectively reverses [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7170.14s)]
*  the age of your skin. I love it. And again, I use this twice a day every day. You can go to [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7176.06s)]
*  oneskin.co and write Peter at checkout for a discount on the same product I use. That's [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7181.9s)]
*  oneskin.co and use the code Peter at checkout. All right, back to the episode. Jared Michaels [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7187.58s)]
*  writes, when will poor people be able to extend their lifespan? [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7196.38s)]
*  So one of the things that we get critique on all the time is the expectation that it's going to be [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7201.58s)]
*  super expensive. And it is initially the gene therapy is not cheap. But as I've said today, [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7207.179999999999s)]
*  we're working on making it as cheap as possible. I could see it being a dollar or less a dose [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7213.58s)]
*  eventually. By the way, patents run out. So even if the company recoups its money, it'll eventually [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7218.139999999999s)]
*  be like aspirin. I mean, you know, Moderna's COVID vaccine was between a dollar or two dollar [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7224.38s)]
*  a dose. When you when you're providing something to a billion people, it gets really cheap. Yeah. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7231.74s)]
*  And actually based on what my lab is doing now, I see no reason why for a few cents a day, [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7236.62s)]
*  everybody could afford a longevity pill. Yeah, I mean, it's a beautiful vision. All right. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7241.1s)]
*  Let's see, V or Vladimir Adelnor asks, what is the difference between the current longevity [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7247.82s)]
*  metrics and actually being young? I can at age 22 go and get in a fight, get drunk, do an overnight [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7255.66s)]
*  while still operating many high skill work at perfection. Whereas longevity folks can't do any [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7265.339999999999s)]
*  of that. We can? I don't know. I feel like I can do anything like that. But listen, [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7271.74s)]
*  I'm not going to put all-nighters like I did in my 20s. Right? Well, our organs are not optimized [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7277.58s)]
*  still. The gene expression, so the epigenome has degraded. You and I have lost some of that [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7283.42s)]
*  information. So our liver cells are not pristine anymore. They are behaving a little bit more like [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7288.139999999999s)]
*  a nerve cell or a skin cell. They're more like a melange of cells. So we need to reboot them so [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7293.74s)]
*  that they know how to be perfectly liver cells again. So that's why I think we, you and I cannot [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7300.38s)]
*  do an all-nighter now and get away with it. But that doesn't mean we can't. I mean, I now look at [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7305.82s)]
*  an old person. I don't see them as an old person. I just see someone who needs a reboot. I love that. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7311.099999999999s)]
*  I love that. Hey you, want to reboot? Come on over here. All right, at Jake Kingsley says, [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7316.219999999999s)]
*  what are the second and third order effects once aging has been cured? Does life have more meaning [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7325.179999999999s)]
*  because it's finite? So this is, it gets in the philosophical conversation here. And I love your [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7331.34s)]
*  thoughts on this. I definitely have opinions. Please. We may share them. I am not enjoying [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7338.46s)]
*  this conversation because I'm worried about dying. I'm enjoying it because the moment is fantastic. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7345.1s)]
*  And I don't think if the fact that I'm going to die one day makes this any more enjoyable. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7349.900000000001s)]
*  I believe every day is a joy. It's a gift. And you make the most of it. And whether I'm going to live [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7355.26s)]
*  80, 200, 400 years, I'm going to enjoy this moment just as much. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7361.42s)]
*  I remind people, listen, the average age for most of human history was like 30. Are you enjoying life [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7367.02s)]
*  now less because we've increased it two and a half or threefold? I don't think so. I'm having a blast. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7374.62s)]
*  I want to see as much of it as I can. The impact of AI on purpose is going to be interesting. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7380.46s)]
*  I think that that's something important to do in this world of extraordinary abundance and [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7388.06s)]
*  cognitive superpowers. Can we continue to keep ourselves engaged and excited about the future? [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7396.38s)]
*  There is another thing. When I have my longevity platinum trip, one of the first exercises I do [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7403.02s)]
*  with people is I say, okay, I want you to write down a piece of paper what you would do with 20 [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7407.900000000001s)]
*  extra healthy years. Write it down. And most people can. Most people can think about 20 extra [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7416.3s)]
*  healthy years. Now I say, what would you do with 50 extra healthy years? And people's minds start [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7423.900000000001s)]
*  to break. It becomes much more difficult for them to do that. What would you do with 50 years? [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7429.34s)]
*  What would I do? I'd keep researching and get us into new places. I had somebody ask me once, [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7434.78s)]
*  why don't I work on climate change? And I figure if we solve aging, I'll just work on something else. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7440.7s)]
*  I love research. I love knowing things for the first time in human history. I'll keep doing [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7446.14s)]
*  science for as long as I am funded and can do it. I love life too. It's so much better than the [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7451.18s)]
*  alternative. But if you look at my father, I didn't expect my father to live beyond 80, [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7457.82s)]
*  nor did he, by the way. And he is loving life like you wouldn't believe. He's out every night [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7463.58s)]
*  with different people. And a lot of them are good friends and women, and they're younger than him. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7469.5s)]
*  It turns out when you're 85, 86. Most people are younger than you. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7476.14s)]
*  There's that. And if you're a man, there's not a lot of competition at that age. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7479.9800000000005s)]
*  But yet, look at him. He would not say, I wish I died at 80. Like some people say, [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7487.26s)]
*  he wants every day and he wouldn't mind another 20 years. I think what we may have to do as a [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7491.9800000000005s)]
*  society is do what Sweden did, which is they recently pegged their longevity to their [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7498.3s)]
*  retirement age. And so as longevity goes up, you work longer. It makes sense. You can't just all [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7503.1s)]
*  sit around drinking cocktails. Yeah. And we'll have a revolt when that happens, but it makes sense. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7508.9400000000005s)]
*  It'll slowly inch up. Let's say longevity goes up by a year in the country, you work for next year. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7514.54s)]
*  Again, what's the alternative? Do you want to just die young? [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7519.5s)]
*  But I think, again, if you feel great, if you've got the energy, if you've got the [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7521.58s)]
*  cognitive clarity, if you've got the mobility, you're going to want to do stuff. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7525.42s)]
*  And maybe there's a world where we've got AI and Androids where we don't have to work for us. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7530.22s)]
*  We have some version of UBI, but health is still going to be the most valuable asset we have. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7534.78s)]
*  All right. So second and third order effects, one other thing that people ask is, oh my God, [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7540.86s)]
*  overpopulation of the planet from people living longer. And of course, I think everybody listening [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7547.9s)]
*  to hear the moonshots knows the numbers here, right? The replacement number of children per [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7553.9s)]
*  family is 2.1. Almost every country on the planet is below that. Some dramatically, right? South [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7561.099999999999s)]
*  Korea is like 0.7 children per family. Japan is not far from that. Italy is evaporating. Most of [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7567.179999999999s)]
*  Europe. Yeah, those economies are screwed by the way, unless they do something. Well, longevity is [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7575.5s)]
*  critical. And robotics and AI are going to be critical. And somehow incentivizing people to [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7581.1s)]
*  build family, I think is critical. Yeah, or extend the fertility age of women, [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7588.860000000001s)]
*  because a lot of women these days leave it till too late. Yeah. I mean, it's not fair to them. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7593.9800000000005s)]
*  I had kids at 50. I'm 64 now. You're a young man. You're 64. Yeah. You're looking great. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7601.740000000001s)]
*  Thank you. I feel great. And my kids are 50. And I keep on telling them, yes, when you're 50, [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7609.42s)]
*  I'll be 100. And I'll still kick your butt. Yeah. Well, I think we men, we tend to take it for [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7614.62s)]
*  granted that we can be fertile and fit for most of our lifespan. But for women, it's not fair. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7622.38s)]
*  Sometimes these careers take 40 years. As a scientist, you're not mature until you're 40. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7629.9s)]
*  And Hollywood paints all these pictures of women in their 40s having kids. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7634.7s)]
*  But that's a struggle. That is struggle. And it's through in vitro fertilization or egg donors. And [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7640.7s)]
*  it just is not communicated. And after 30, it's a precipitous drop in fertility. So if you're a [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7646.139999999999s)]
*  woman in your 20s, look at those numbers and realize that after 30, it's going to go down [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7652.62s)]
*  dramatically and try to make life's plan until we figure out a solution. Freeze eggs? Is that? Yes. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7657.179999999999s)]
*  Freeze fertilized eggs if you can. And follow these protocols. It's every indication that we [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7663.98s)]
*  can delay infertility by delaying aging. Yeah. All right. Mad Scientist asks, if aging is fixed [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7668.86s)]
*  and we all live for 500 years, what will happen next? What are all of the pros and cons of life [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7678.379999999999s)]
*  past 150 years of age? Listen, I revert to Star Trek. There's a lot of universe out there. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7686.86s)]
*  I just want to see it all. I also imagine uploading. I think we'll get there. We just [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7694.0599999999995s)]
*  mapped the connectome of a drosophila. Did you see that work? Yeah. Yeah, it's amazing. And I [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7700.62s)]
*  had on stage at my Abundance Summit last year, a gentleman, Michael Andreg, who is working on [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7706.219999999999s)]
*  mapping a mouse and he believes the technology now exists to map the human brain fully uploaded. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7713.179999999999s)]
*  The problem is it's destructive in process. Yeah. That's a slight downside. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7721.1s)]
*  I'm going to have my AI up on the cloud over the speakers that will say, [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7727.58s)]
*  hey, Peter, you've successfully uploaded. You can kill yourselves now. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7732.06s)]
*  Yeah, there's a good Black Mirror episode on that. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7736.06s)]
*  Listen, I'm going to hit this for a second. I am pissed off at Black Mirror. I'm pissed off at [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7738.86s)]
*  Hollywood because we humans need a positive vision of the future to aim for. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7745.34s)]
*  We need a story that is compelling and abundant and hopeful. And we don't have many of those. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7753.82s)]
*  Star Trek was the one that really lit me on fire. We need more of those. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7763.5s)]
*  Yeah, I couldn't agree more. And especially when it comes to longevity, it's usually, [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7769.02s)]
*  something's gone horribly wrong. Yes. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7773.42s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. At Sharon Bank says, maybe ask about longevity's economic impact. Keep it [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7775.74s)]
*  insightful. So I want to drill down more into the Harvard London School of Business Oxford paper [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7784.46s)]
*  because I want to understand how we get to tens of trillions of dollars from one year [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7792.78s)]
*  of additional healthy life because that's what it's saying. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7801.02s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, the global economy is 110 trillion dollars. Was this for the US or was it for the [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7804.06s)]
*  globe? Do you remember? It was just US for one year extra. It's the value to the economy. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7811.660000000001s)]
*  And the value is the key word. The value is how much are we people willing to pay. It's called [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7817.26s)]
*  the willingness to pay, WTP. And the way economists use this number is they say, [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7822.78s)]
*  what's it worth to you to have an extra year of life? And the reason that the number balloons out [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7829.74s)]
*  astronomically is that there's a positive feedback is that for every extra year that somebody lives, [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7835.74s)]
*  it turns out they want more of that and they're willing to pay for more of that. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7845.18s)]
*  Yeah. And that's one of the main reasons. And then of course, you can take away a lot of the [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7849.5s)]
*  healthcare issues. The longer somebody lives, the less burden they are on the economy. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7853.58s)]
*  And that also factors in. But healthcare is expensive. Somebody who's got dementia or [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7857.66s)]
*  ALS like my mother-in-law, this is super expensive. That's just one person costing tens of thousands [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7864.0599999999995s)]
*  a day to be looked after. If she was still healthy at 76, she'd be still earning. She'd be looking [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7870.62s)]
*  after. She'd be spending. Yeah. So this is what Jim and I says, research published in Nature Aging [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7877.66s)]
*  in 2021. You were an author on this paper, right? Yeah. By a team, including Harvard and Oxford, [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7884.0599999999995s)]
*  economists showed that a slowdown in aging that increased life expectancy by one year [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7889.9s)]
*  is worth an estimated $38 trillion to the global economy. So again, I find those numbers crazy. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7897.18s)]
*  I wish I'd been able to feed that information to Elon at the beginning of his... Like spend [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7907.66s)]
*  the government money solving aging and then I have to worry about any of this other stuff. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7915.58s)]
*  Yeah. That would have been much better. At Cassinova says, what are the most effective [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7920.54s)]
*  over-the-counter modalities available today for under $1,000? So we talked about some of those [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7926.78s)]
*  supplements. I don't think any of them are expensive. Exercise, I would think exercise [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7932.7s)]
*  is like the most important modality. How do you feel about that? I think yes. What you eat and [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7938.38s)]
*  exercise, those are the two big ones. Relatively easy. It's a little bit more technical to get [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7943.74s)]
*  your supplements right because it's tailored to you. But cardiovascular disease, there's something [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7949.179999999999s)]
*  that I've been taking for a couple of years now. And that actually has been shown in studies to [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7954.94s)]
*  reverse cardiovascular disease, it removes plaque. What is it? It's called netokinase. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7960.54s)]
*  Oh yeah, I take netokinase as well. Great. I take it for post-COVID on airplane flights, [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7966.3s)]
*  just reducing clotting potentially. Oh, so that's the short term, but the long-term benefit was [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7972.54s)]
*  there was a study with 1,086 people, a Chinese study, but it was very well powered. And they [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7977.98s)]
*  showed that up to 95% of plaque got removed in one year. Wow. Just by taking, but you need at least [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7984.62s)]
*  12 units a day. They called FU units, but not FU, but Fibrillated Units. So I've been doing that, [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=7993.099999999999s)]
*  and it's been so far great. I measure my carotid with ultrasound, and there's no plaque build up [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8002.86s)]
*  there at all. So it's hard to reduce that, but I do take it as prevention. Let me see where I am on [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8009.099999999999s)]
*  netokinase. Netokinase is an enzyme that digests fibrin, which is part of your plaque. I'm on 100 [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8015.0199999999995s)]
*  milligrams of netokinase. I don't know how many units that translates to. Yeah. I would say if [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8022.0599999999995s)]
*  you don't want to take a lot of pills, at least 6,000 units would be a good start, and then work [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8027.18s)]
*  out from there. But of course, do this with the knowledge of your physician. Yeah. I have an army [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8030.94s)]
*  of doctors I hire. I have 30 of them that are working for me at the out and live cell. That's [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8035.98s)]
*  true, but not everyone can do that. But still, just in general, just as a warning, if you do [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8040.7s)]
*  change your lifestyle and supplements, just make sure your doctor knows about it. Yeah, for sure. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8045.82s)]
*  One of the things I really so desperately want is, and there was a question only about what people [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8050.0599999999995s)]
*  should build, I want an AI model that will take in my genetics, take in my recent blood work, [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8055.66s)]
*  take in my goals. I want higher cognitive clarity, I want more muscle, I want more longevity, [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8064.86s)]
*  whatever your goals are, you prioritize them, and then how many pills a day you want to take. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8069.9s)]
*  Yeah. And it should spit out a prioritized list, because right now you go to one doctor, [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8073.9s)]
*  you'll get one set. You listen to you or me, you'll get another set, you listen to another person, [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8078.139999999999s)]
*  another set. There isn't optimal. There truly is. And so- It wouldn't be that hard, actually. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8082.78s)]
*  No, it wouldn't be. The data's out there. We're working on that. But you go to doctors, [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8088.78s)]
*  and most doctors would say, what's netokinase? They can't keep up with the literature. It's [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8092.94s)]
*  just too much. But AI can. AI can. Let's talk about something that you and I might differ on. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8096.78s)]
*  I'm curious. Sleep. I suck at it. How do you do? [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8102.7s)]
*  I got a 92 last night, which I was very happy about on my Ororen. I won't tell you what I got. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8108.54s)]
*  I will tell you, because I'm going to look right now. Last night was awful. I mean, [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8114.78s)]
*  I'm usually very proud of my sleep. Last night, I got a 64. So lowest I've gotten in like a year. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8118.38s)]
*  And I think it was, I've been so going 24-7 this week, getting ready for being gone for two weeks [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8128.38s)]
*  and whatever it was, but I made up for it today. Definitely. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8137.18s)]
*  Good. Well, I try my best. I'm open traveling. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8141.5s)]
*  You said to me once you think you can get away with less sleep. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8145.34s)]
*  I have figured out how to do that. Okay, pray tell. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8148.78s)]
*  It's about the amount of deep sleep that you get. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8152.14s)]
*  Sure. And so I've got a- [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8154.46s)]
*  Which is the most important thing, right? [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8155.74s)]
*  A supplement that I take that puts me straight into deep sleep. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8157.02s)]
*  Is it a Dora drug? Is it- [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8160.38s)]
*  Serena makes it. Serena sells it actually. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8162.9400000000005s)]
*  I'm happy. You're not promoting her, but I can. What is it? [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8166.62s)]
*  It's called Sweet Dreams and it's changed a lot of lives. It's a mixture of low dose melatonin, [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8169.74s)]
*  five HDPs, L-thionine. It's magical. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8176.219999999999s)]
*  Where would I find it? What website? [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8180.54s)]
*  Even if she wasn't my partner, I would say that's what I take. Because I used to have [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8181.82s)]
*  insomnia really badly and I'm off Ambien now. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8185.42s)]
*  Oh yeah. Ambien's just terrible. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8188.3s)]
*  You just get it on her website, serenalove.com. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8189.82s)]
*  Okay. Fantastic. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8192.46s)]
*  Thanks, Peter. Again, I'm not here to promote it. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8193.9s)]
*  No, I get it. But we share what we know that works for us and that's all we can do. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8196.22s)]
*  Another disclaimer. I just want to make sure everyone knows that my thoughts, [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8204.699999999999s)]
*  my opinions, and even what I just said have nothing to do with Harvard Medical School. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8209.5s)]
*  They're just my employer. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8213.34s)]
*  And they're not medical advice? [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8214.22s)]
*  No. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8215.66s)]
*  Okay. Sam Rankinmah asks, what are the top 10 practical longevity tips? [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8216.619999999999s)]
*  Top three for each organ? And which five longevity gadgets do you recommend? [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8226.859999999999s)]
*  So let's go with the last part. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8234.22s)]
*  We can go for gadgets. [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8236.06s)]
*  Gadgets, yeah. What are you using for gadgets? [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8236.94s)]
*  In our home, we have a red lightbed. It's a big one. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8238.539999999999s)]
*  You have the Thor, the lie down one. I have panels right now that I use a panel for. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8241.66s)]
*  It's a big thing with a lid. It looks like a tanning bed, but it's not. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8245.74s)]
*  Yeah, I love that. So I do red light many mornings as I possibly can. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8251.42s)]
*  Yeah. The other thing I've been doing is I have a red light portable and I put it [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8256.94s)]
*  outside the shower shining in. And so as I'm in the shower, I'm getting red light there every [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8261.9s)]
*  two and it's also a steam shower, which is nice. So that's one red light. I use that on my head as [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8265.82s)]
*  well. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8271.18s)]
*  Yeah, I have a red light cap for hair growth, you know, stimulation. Just doing okay. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8271.66s)]
*  It's working. I still can't believe you're 65. So it's 64. Sorry, I didn't mean to insult you. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8275.58s)]
*  Age me. No, that's okay. That's fine. You know, I've gotten to a point where I'm [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8281.58s)]
*  stating my age with pride versus hiding it because I am 64 and that's it. And I'm just like, you know, [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8285.42s)]
*  for me, that is a call to action to remain at highest health status for as long as possible [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8294.46s)]
*  because we have incredible tech coming our way and I want to intercept that longevity escape. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8303.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you're also a role model and, you know. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8307.5s)]
*  I feel like I'm 28 or 29. That's my internal age. That's my internal number for myself. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8312.06s)]
*  Yeah, I would say physically you look like you'd be in 30s, 40s and you move just like you were [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8317.419999999998s)]
*  in your 30s, 40s, I bet. And by the way, my father is stronger, fitter and more flexible than I am [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8323.58s)]
*  with better balance and he's at 86. So it's very doable. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8328.939999999999s)]
*  On my birthday a few weeks ago and I pumped out 100 push-ups in a row, which was, you know, [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8332.3s)]
*  when I was in my 20s, the most I could do was 40 and I got to 50 and I've increased it from there. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8338.94s)]
*  And I'm not saying that to brag. I'm just saying I use that as a measure for how I'm doing. In fact, [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8344.22s)]
*  in my longevity guidebook, I put my measurements that I've been measuring over the last few years [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8349.34s)]
*  in terms of squats and push-ups and, you know, all of the plank pose and such. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8356.539999999999s)]
*  And it's important for you to measure yourself. Of course, you get a lot of data from your [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8360.939999999999s)]
*  DEXA scans and your MRIs and so forth. The data does matter. Obviously, you have an aura ring on too. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8366.46s)]
*  I have a ring and I don't say what type it is. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8374.22s)]
*  Okay, fair enough. Do you use, I don't have my CGM on. Do you use a CGM? [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8376.22s)]
*  I do. Yeah, not every week, but, you know, when I feel like it's probably five times a year or [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8382.38s)]
*  something and different brands are better than others. You want to try and research what works. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8389.019999999999s)]
*  But monitoring your glucose, a lot of doctors, maybe not a lot of doctors, [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8394.779999999999s)]
*  but I've seen some doctors say it's irresponsible for people to have access to that data. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8398.539999999999s)]
*  What? [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8404.38s)]
*  It should be for doctors. Yeah, you know, I mean, look online. There are some doctors who are [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8404.619999999999s)]
*  dead against CGMs unless you've got diabetes and even then, which I'm dead against. First of all, [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8407.98s)]
*  who are you to say that I can't know about my own body, right? [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8412.859999999999s)]
*  That's insane. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8416.06s)]
*  And that I'm not educated enough to understand this. I would say a lot of the people out there [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8416.619999999999s)]
*  are just as educated about glucose than their own doctors. So I'm definitely in the camp of, [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8420.539999999999s)]
*  we have a right to know our own genetics, our own epigenetics, our own glucose levels, [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8426.699999999999s)]
*  and information is power. As long as you're telling your doctor what you're doing and [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8430.699999999999s)]
*  talking to them about it, you got to do doctor supervision. It's fine. When I talk to my doctors, [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8435.5s)]
*  they say, can we see the data? We'd love to see it. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8440.3s)]
*  Yeah. One thing that is, I'm curious about your thought here. I hate the notion that the government [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8444.54s)]
*  prohibits me from participating actively in experimental treatments. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8455.02s)]
*  If I'm at the end of life and my option is death in some of the months, why do I have to leave the [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8459.5s)]
*  country to go and try an experimental treatment? Why if I'm of sound mind or if my family agrees, [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8469.1s)]
*  the right to test, right to use, right to try is getting going. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8477.42s)]
*  And it's done under doctor supervision. You're a doctor, but most people don't just say, [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8488.78s)]
*  I want to try this, give it to me. It's done under doctor supervision. So your physician makes the [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8493.26s)]
*  decision with you. So just the idea that, oh, the uneducated decision is not true. Same with [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8498.54s)]
*  euthanasia. You have to go overseas now if you want to do that. And if you're in agony every day, [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8505.26s)]
*  I mean, who are we to say that you shouldn't do what you want with your life? [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8511.02s)]
*  All right. Entropy asks a question I'm curious about. How long do you want to live? [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8515.5s)]
*  So there's an interesting one. I'm on stage. I'll ask people in the room here, [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8523.1s)]
*  how long do you think you're going to live? You have a number in your brain. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8530.300000000001s)]
*  And where do you get that number from? And why do you believe it? And I find it fascinating [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8535.26s)]
*  that this mindset that people have this number can make, has implications, right? Your mind is a very [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8542.06s)]
*  powerful force on how long you'll live. So you're asking me those questions. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8553.58s)]
*  I'm asking you how long do you want to live and why, and why is the important part? [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8557.26s)]
*  Right. If you're willing. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8563.66s)]
*  No, it's fine. I think it's a better question to ask, when do you want to die? [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8565.5s)]
*  And as long as I'm healthy and I have friends, I find that there will never be a day when I want [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8571.1s)]
*  to die. And I think that's true for just about everybody. You know, if you're sick, frail, [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8576.86s)]
*  lonely, depressed, that's when those thoughts come in. But I don't know anybody, and I've talked to [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8581.26s)]
*  thousands and thousands of people, big crowds like you, if you're healthy and have friends and [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8586.06s)]
*  family, do you want to die tomorrow? No one ever says, yeah, take me out. But when do I want to die? [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8591.58s)]
*  Never. I don't like the idea of being dead. I think it's pretty boring. But you know, it doesn't [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8598.38s)]
*  mean I believe I'm going to live forever, but I also don't think that if I'm staying healthy [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8606.46s)]
*  and active and having fun, why would I want to die? Why would anybody want to die? [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8611.66s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, David, I truly love what you do. I consider you a dear [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8615.1s)]
*  friend and I'm grateful for you in my life. Let me recap a couple of things for listeners at home. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8623.42s)]
*  David's new book, Lifespan Survival is coming out in 2026. A number of you asked when is his [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8630.7s)]
*  podcast coming back? Well, David's podcast is coming back. It's coming back this fall. What's it called? [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8637.34s)]
*  The Lifespan with David Sinclair. Awesome. And I asked earlier, your producer, and if you want to [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8643.82s)]
*  get on his list to get access to it when it comes out, go to davidasinclair.com. What's the A stand [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8650.78s)]

*  join me in supporting David's research and his extraordinary team at his lab. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8678.62s)]
*  In the show notes, you'll see a link to be able to donate at a 50k to $1,000 level [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8685.980000000001s)]
*  through Harvard Medical School. It's tax deductible. We'll put up once again here the QR code [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8695.34s)]
*  for the Coinbase wallet where those of you can donate either Stablecoin, Ethereum, or Bitcoin. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8702.54s)]
*  I hope you'll join me. And I would love to get like a massive surprise from somebody who comes [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8712.78s)]

*  Yeah. So my lab runs on $3 million a year. Okay. So $3 million. If someone does that, [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8723.18s)]
*  then I'll give them my entire protocol. Give them everything. I mean, what's it worth? [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8728.06s)]
*  In success, this is a micro investment for the impact on humanity. Yeah. And there'll be spin [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8732.7s)]
*  outs too. Yeah. And oh, by the way, you were there when it's Steve Aoki's. Oh, yeah. So we were at an [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8738.78s)]
*  auction and we were the auctions. We were. I forget what you offered, but for mine, it was a tour of my [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8745.42s)]
*  lab. And that went for a hundred K. Yeah. So all the friends are welcome to have that as a bonus [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8751.82s)]
*  to come by my lab and see what we're up to. And the third approach is joining David and myself [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8757.1s)]

*  serious about joining Friends of Sinclair Lab, you'll see David and I once a quarter and we'll [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8780.38s)]
*  talk about what's the latest and greatest, what's going on in your lab, [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8787.339999999998s)]
*  what the investment opportunities are, what the breakthroughs are. And when we'll see it, [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8791.099999999999s)]

*  I really, really did. It was really great to catch up again. I'm going to see you in Boston [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8813.5s)]
*  at the end of September. And by the way, if you want more information to join me for my five-day, [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8820.14s)]
*  five-star longevity platinum trip, it's capped at 60 people. We spend five days together with the most [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8825.98s)]
*  extraordinary scientists in the world, like David, like George George, like Dean Kamen, [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8832.86s)]
*  go deep for those days. You can go to abundance360.com slash longevity and learn more information about it. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8838.86s)]
*  Excited to spend the weekend with you. And then in March at the abundance summit, again, [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8846.86s)]
*  it's been a few years since you were there and so much, so much progress in this age of AI. It's [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8853.5s)]
*  awesome. It is. Yeah. And every year it just gets better and better. And I also want to speak on [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8860.46s)]
*  behalf of everyone listening. I think we all feel the same way about you. You're a unique individual [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8865.339999999998s)]
*  on the planet and thank God you exist. Cause yeah, you make things happen that otherwise would never [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8870.14s)]
*  be in history. And you've already shown that you've done that. So maybe with longevity, [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8875.82s)]
*  that'll be your legacy too. Yeah, I hope so. I look forward to partnering with you on that. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8880.46s)]
*  Thank you, my friend. All right, buddy. Be well. You too. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8883.74s)]
*  If you could have had a 10 year head start on the dot-com boom back in the 2000s, would you have [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8886.779999999999s)]
*  taken it? Every week I track the major tech meta trends. These are massive game changing shifts [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3lGy07Fgo&t=8891.34s)]
