# Transform Your Life with AI Health Breakthroughs | EP #149
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA)
*  So many people are suffering from brain fog, weight gain, water retention, poor responses to exercise, poor sleep, poor deep sleep, and they think that these are just consequences of aging. They're not. They're consequences of aging. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=0.0s)]
*  Gary Breck is a human biologist. To say that this guy has changed my life is the understatement of the century. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=12.0s)]
*  I will add seven years to the lifespan and the health span of every person in this room. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=17.0s)]
*  Of all the biohacks, I'm probably most excited about hydrogen gas and hydrogen water. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=23.0s)]
*  Do you have a visceral impact? Do you feel different? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=29.0s)]
*  No question. I think it's the most overlooked in all of biohacking today. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=32.0s)]
*  We know that we can't change the pH of the body by drinking alkaline water. We can change the pH of the body by adding hydrogen gas. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=37.0s)]
*  This is what I call the golden age of health span. Why some people live to 120 and others are dead at 50. There's a reason. And we're going to be able to understand that and begin to impact that. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=44.0s)]
*  Now that's the moonshot, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=59.0s)]
*  Everybody welcome to moonshots. My guest today is Gary Breck, renowned human biologist, biohacker and longevity expert with over 20 years of experience on optimizing human performance and functional medicine. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=65.0s)]
*  Gary and I are going to be talking about the technology that's available to you today in your home, in your life to help you extend your health span and your lifespan. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=79.0s)]
*  He's the co-founder of 10x Health Systems, past CEO of Streamline Medical Group and the host of the Ultimate Human Podcast. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=88.0s)]
*  I recently visited him in Miami, got a chance to play with his toys. He is the kid with the most biology and ultimate hacking toys out there. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=96.0s)]
*  We'll be going through it, what you can use today, what he does and when he does it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=106.0s)]
*  You're going to want to take some notes here and decide what you want on your Christmas list. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=112.0s)]
*  All right, everybody, let's jump into our podcast on the technology you can use for optimizing your health and performance. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=116.0s)]
*  Gary, welcome to Moonshots, buddy. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=122.0s)]
*  I'm so excited to be here, man. I really am. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=123.0s)]
*  I enjoyed being at your home in Miami. It was a technology showcase for sure. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=126.0s)]
*  We're going to talk about a range of technologies that people need to understand are becoming available today that can help you, first off, understand what's going on inside your body and then how to improve it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=134.0s)]
*  These are not technologies that are super expensive. They're not technologies that take a huge amount of time, but they are hacks and tricks and so forth. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=150.0s)]
*  I think we're going to start to see, especially as AI starts to play into this coming decade. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=160.0s)]
*  I'm imagining that when I come back to Gary Brekka's home in the next few years, you're going to be sitting there talking to Jarvis. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=167.0s)]
*  Jarvis is going to be picking up all of your sensors on your body and saying, Gary, hop in the hydrogen bath. I need some cryo. I need this. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=176.0s)]
*  You can turn on your AI biohacker support system. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=185.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah, I believe in that too. I think everybody's excited about my biohacking habit, except my wife, because every single room in the house has got something in it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=190.0s)]
*  I guess there are other things, better things, or worse things you could be addicted to. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=200.0s)]
*  I don't play cars or anything like that. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=204.0s)]
*  She was in the jacuzzi right there at the time. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=206.0s)]
*  Yeah, she was in the cold plunge. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=210.0s)]
*  She was in the cold plunge, that's right. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=212.0s)]
*  I think when I finally put the HOCAT machine, when I put the transdermal ozone machine in our master bedroom, she was like, okay, I've had enough of your biohacking habit. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=214.0s)]
*  But it's amazing. I'm just to have a childlike fascination with human performance and cellular biology and all of the technology, this bridge between artificial intelligence technology and human optimization. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=224.0s)]
*  There's some really fascinating technologies out there. Not all of them are very expensive either that have significant impacts on our cellular biology. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=239.0s)]
*  We're going to talk about that. I think this is what I call the golden age of HealthSpan. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=249.0s)]
*  This is the age of the HealthSpan revolution. I want people to understand what's possible today. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=258.0s)]
*  Actually, it's funny because you and Tony Robbins have been in both of your homes. Tony is a dear friend and a partner, and you've been there as well. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=265.0s)]
*  You've got the best toys on the planet. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=273.0s)]
*  We just collect the right toys. Some people collect cars. We collect biohacking devices. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=276.0s)]
*  We'll chat about that. What do we got here? Mine is colored red and yours is colored blue. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=283.0s)]
*  Yours just needs to be charged. Mine is just telling me that it's charged. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=290.0s)]
*  This is a reflection of my inner being. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=293.0s)]
*  It didn't turn red when you grabbed it. This is hydrogen gas. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=296.0s)]
*  Probably of all the biohacks under $30 a month, let's say, I'm probably most excited about hydrogen gas and hydrogen water. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=300.0s)]
*  This bottle will run you about $250, but you can get these elemental magnesium tablets and drop them in a bottle of water and create high part per million hydrogen gas. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=313.0s)]
*  I think it's the most overlooked modality in all of biohacking today. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=323.0s)]
*  Let's dive in there because I'm a scientist, I'm a physician, I'm a biohacker, and understanding fundamentally what's driving hydrogen's benefit. I'd love to understand it. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=331.0s)]
*  There are lots of studies, and I'll send them to you so you can link them in the show notes, on hydrogen gas and its capacity to lower inflammation, improve circulation, to improve markers of methylation. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=346.0s)]
*  There's a really interesting study that I thought is probably worth mentioning in the Journal of Experimental Gerontology. It was published in November of 2021. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=359.0s)]
*  What was interesting about this study, and we could talk about a lot of the other clinical evidence for hydrogen gas, which is a very prevalent gas in the human body. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=367.0s)]
*  It's harmless to human beings. It is an antioxidant. It actually donates electrons. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=376.0s)]
*  Historically and evolutionarily, we have reduced the amount of hydrogen gas that is in our diets, that is in our gut microbiome, that is in our water. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=383.0s)]
*  Most of our water is very still now. If you scooped water out of a running stream, you'd find high part per million hydrogen versus bottled water, which is going to be more stagnant. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=395.0s)]
*  Most of the time it's been sitting for about two years. It's a really interesting thing you could do even at home. You can order off of Amazon for a couple of bucks. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=405.0s)]
*  You can order something called an ORP meter, oxidative reduction potential. You just go on Amazon. They're between 12 and 15 bucks. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=413.0s)]
*  This is a millivoltage meter that will actually measure the capacity of a fluid like water to either slightly cause oxidation or to reduce oxidation. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=420.0s)]
*  You want this number to be negative. The more negative the number, the more it has the capacity to reduce inflammation. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=432.0s)]
*  What you'll find is if you poured standard bottled water into here, it would have a positive ORP, meaning it's not reducing inflammation. It's actually causing some oxidation of about 150 to 200. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=438.0s)]
*  The second you hit that button and add hydrogen gas or you drop an elemental magnesium tablet in that glass of water and it effervesces into hydrogen gas, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=449.0s)]
*  you'll see the ORP drop to negative 400 to negative 500. This study in the Journal of Experimental Gerontology back in 2021 actually looked at a six month placebo controlled randomized group. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=458.0s)]
*  Is this about the acidification of your body? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=473.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's about the acidification of your body. Exactly. Because we know that we can't change the pH of the body by drinking alkaline water. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=475.0s)]
*  We can change the pH of the body by adding hydrogen gas, micro bubbles of hydrogen gas to your water because pH stands for the potential of hydrogen. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=481.0s)]
*  They'd say it's a charge. If you want to change the charge in the body, change the charge with hydrogen or you can do it by touching the surface of the earth or laying on a PEMF mat and using a low Gauss current. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=491.0s)]
*  What's really fascinating is most studies will look at healthy populations when they want to study recovery or traumatic brain injuries or post-surgical recovery. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=501.0s)]
*  This particular study looked at 70-year-old men and women over a six month period of time. Some were just drinking regular water, the others were drinking high part per million hydrogen water. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=510.0s)]
*  I really encourage your readers, your viewers to look this study up. It's incredible. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=521.0s)]
*  They actually used well-known markers of methylation, one called Tet-2, Tet-methylcytosine deoxygenase to actually measure the impact on methylation. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=528.0s)]
*  So cellular methylation, which is a marker of cellular metabolism, how well your cells are actually taking nutrients and converting them into the usable form. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=540.0s)]
*  They measured choline levels in the left frontal lobe of the brain. They measured creatine levels in the right parietal area of the brain. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=548.0s)]
*  They measured sit-stand ratios. So they found that it was an anti-sarcopenic. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=558.0s)]
*  They measured several markers of inflammation, C-reactive protein, creatine phosphokinase and others. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=562.0s)]
*  And across the board, just simply adding hydrogen gas to the water improved all of these markers, including telomere length, which was pretty astounding. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=568.0s)]
*  So let me put some numbers against this. So how much hydrogen gas enriched water will you consume per day? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=576.0s)]
*  So in the mornings, I'll use it instead of caffeine. So a single tablet will get you to between 9 and 12 parts per million hydrogen. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=584.0s)]
*  Some people can tolerate more than others. I drink four or five of those a day. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=593.0s)]
*  Four or five tablets. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=597.0s)]
*  Four or five of those tablets throughout the day or four or five of these bottles throughout the day. It will mitigate all of the effects of travel. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=598.0s)]
*  I mean, if you want to do an interesting experiment, when you wake up in the morning, take four or five of these elemental magnesium tablets, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=604.0s)]
*  four or five of them, drop them in about a half a liter of water, about 750 mLs of water in room temperature. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=611.0s)]
*  And about 50 seconds, they will effervesce and those micro bubbles will be in the water. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=619.0s)]
*  And just drink that entire 750 mLs of water and just feel how switched on you are. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=624.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=630.0s)]
*  Oh, you are instantly switched on. You can feel the inflammatory cascade dropping. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=631.0s)]
*  You feel more mentally alert, more clear, more cognizant. I mean, it sounds like I'm just trying to sell hydrogen water. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=635.0s)]
*  Technically, I am. I'm just, I think of all of the biohacks that are out there. You know, you got a red lightbed, it costs $119,000. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=641.0s)]
*  And elemental magnesium H2 tabs will cost you less than a buck a day. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=648.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=652.0s)]
*  And will completely change the trajectory. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=653.0s)]
*  I mean, listen, so, you know, I am again an experimentalist and it is, does, do you have a visceral impact? Do you feel different? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=654.0s)]
*  No question that you will feel different. I mean, the markers for sleep improved in the majority of these people. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=662.0s)]
*  You found better deep and REM sleep. And, you know, as we know, deep sleep is where we're detoxifying our glymphatic systems active. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=668.0s)]
*  REM sleep is where we're assembling memories and putting the cognitive actions of the day together with our subconscious and our learning. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=675.0s)]
*  Dr. Mio, take a second about carbonated water. How do you feel about that? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=682.0s)]
*  So CO2, I think has the opposite effect. I haven't seen any studies on carbonated beverages having an impact on inflammation, cognitive function. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=688.0s)]
*  Are you warning people against using carbonated water? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=700.0s)]
*  I think if you're going to drink water, you should drink still water with hydrogen. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=704.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=708.0s)]
*  I think there's, there is, the two shouldn't even be in the same zip code. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=709.0s)]
*  So I have not been and I will go and run this experiment for myself. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=712.0s)]
*  I'll link the studies and, you know, I even have a hydrogen bath at the house. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=716.0s)]
*  I saw that when we were taking the tour. And in fact, the way you described it was such that, okay, if I have 20 minutes extra, I'm jumping in the bathroom. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=721.0s)]
*  No question. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=729.0s)]
*  So we'll show an image of this in a little bit, but this is a normal bathtub where the external hydrogen generator that's bubbling hydrogen into the water and you're not consuming it. You're just bathing it. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=731.0s)]
*  It's going right transdermal. So it's a hydrogen gas generator. You essentially fill it up with distilled water. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=745.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=751.0s)]
*  And what it will do is it'll take the distilled water, it'll break it apart, it'll throw the oxygen into the air and it'll put the hydrogen gas into the water. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=752.0s)]
*  I've got this up on the screen here. That's the generator. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=757.0s)]
*  That is an absolute game changer. I think if I only had a single biohacking device, it would be a toss up between that and a red light therapy bed. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=760.0s)]
*  And a good red light bed is going to cost you over a hundred grand. That'll cost you seven grand. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=771.0s)]
*  So a hydrogen bath is seven grand. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=777.0s)]
*  Yeah. And there are places where you can go and do this. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=779.0s)]
*  So what's the... Okay. I'm still trying to understand as a physician and a scientist how this is impacting me. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=783.0s)]
*  Well, when you say something is an antioxidant, what does that mean? What does it mean when blueberries are antioxidants? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=790.0s)]
*  It means that they're donating ions. It means that they're reducing the inflammation. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=795.0s)]
*  And very specifically, if you can get hydrogen gas to go transdermal, which you can, you're affecting microvascular circulation. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=799.0s)]
*  If you look at our circulatory system, a lot of people don't realize that 70% of our circulation is not actually done by our heart. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=806.0s)]
*  Nobody has a heart that's strong enough to pump blood from the center of your chest to the tip of your toes, through all the capillaries in your brain, your liver, your lung, your pancreas, your kidneys. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=814.0s)]
*  The heart's circulating about 30 to 32% of the blood in our circulatory system. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=822.0s)]
*  And the rest of it is done by an activity called vasomotion or vasomotor. It's almost... Think of a snake swallowing a mouse. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=827.0s)]
*  Right? So it pumps the blood to the entrance of these very small capillaries, and then there's a wave-like peristaltic motion. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=834.0s)]
*  And you've got these valves in your venous system that only flow the blood in one direction. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=840.0s)]
*  Only flow the blood in one direction in this vasomotor activity, again, like a snake swallowing a mouse, and the mouse never goes back the other way, similar to how our intestinal tract works. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=845.0s)]
*  There's no pressure behind the intestinal tract. There's a peristaltic motion to the intestinal tract. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=853.0s)]
*  And this is the first part of our circulatory system to be compromised. If you think of 70% of our circulation is microvascular, and it needs a vasomotor or vasomotion activity in order to function, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=859.0s)]
*  you could improve 70% of your circulation if you were able to affect vasomotor activity, which transdermal hydrogen will... Or oral hydrogen will do the same thing. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=870.0s)]
*  So I want to put some numbers on this again. So you said, okay, run the experiment, have three quarters of a liter of water, put in four or five of the tabs, down it, see how you feel. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=881.0s)]
*  Instead of coffee. Next time you have a hangover, take four or five... I don't drink, but if you drink and you get a hangover, or you just have a headache, you have a migraine, you have a headache, you feel brain fog and you need to be awake, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=890.0s)]
*  take four or five of those H2 tabs, drop them in water. You can get them at www.drinkh2tabs.com. Like I said, it's less than a buck a day. One of the reasons why I'm so fascinated by it. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=902.0s)]
*  And drop those in there and just drink that 750 milliliters of water, and I promise you, the worst of all headaches or worst of all hangovers will be gone in 10 or 12 minutes. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=915.0s)]
*  Amazing. So having done that, what do you do during the day? Do you continue this level of consumption? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=925.0s)]
*  Yes, just a single tablet in 12 to 16 ounces of water. I drink the Mountain Valley Spring water, it comes in the bottles. So it's 750 mLs is half a liter. You can get the big liters too. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=930.0s)]
*  Just put a single hydrogen tablet in there and just sip on that throughout the day. I'll take four or five of those throughout the day. It's an absolute game changer. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=942.0s)]
*  Everybody, Peter here. If you're enjoying this episode, please help me get the message of abundance out to the world. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=950.0s)]
*  We're truly living during the most extraordinary time ever in human history, and I want to get this mindset out to everyone. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=957.0s)]
*  Please subscribe and follow wherever you get your podcasts and turn on notifications so we can let you know when the next episode is being dropped. All right, back to our episode. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=964.0s)]
*  Let's go back to the bath one second. And again, the technology is pretty direct and pretty simple. It's bubbling in. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=974.0s)]
*  You described to me a few of the athletes that you've treated and it's been a game changer for them. So who comes in? Why are you saying jump in the bath? How long in the bath for and what's the impact? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=981.0s)]
*  So one that's in the public domain recently, John Jones, when he was preparing for his fight, I think he fought on November 16th of last year, was his last heavyweight fight. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=993.0s)]
*  He was intending to retire initially after that fight. I sat next to him at a UFC fight in the sphere and he leaned over and he put his hand on my leg. He grabbed my leg. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1004.0s)]
*  You do whatever you want, bro. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1019.0s)]
*  And he literally looks, he looks me in the eye and he goes, you're a man of God, aren't you? And I said, yeah, yeah, I am. And he said, I feel like God put you in my life at this moment. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1024.0s)]
*  I really need to talk to you. And he's put this out in the public domain. And when I spoke to him, he said, listen, for the last 12 or 15 years, I just wake up every morning in excruciating pain. I mean, he's a division one wrestler. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1037.0s)]
*  He beat up his body a lot. He beat up his body. He's the greatest heavyweight, maybe one of the greatest fighters according to Dana White to ever live. I believe that. And he's an absolute gem of a human being. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1052.0s)]
*  He's an absolute gem of a human being. But so a few weeks later, I flew out to his fight camp. And when he told me about how sore and achy all of his joints were, he was slow time recovering. And it was taking him a long time from waking in the morning until he could start to train. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1066.0s)]
*  And he was only training five days a week, not six days a week. So he's taken two days off on the weekends. I introduced hydrogen water to him. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1085.0s)]
*  So you're thinking this is whole body inflammation? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1092.0s)]
*  Whole body inflammation. If you think about where we get inflammation, the majority of this is going to focus in the areas of the most compromised blood flow. So ligaments, tendons, bones, cartilaginous surfaces, joints, areas where the muscular tendon is insertion, that area where you don't have a lot of blood flow. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1095.0s)]
*  You don't get a lot of soreness in your muscles if you're used to training, but you get a lot of joint soreness. You get a lot of tendon and ligament soreness. And you get a lot of chronic inflammation in those areas. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1113.0s)]
*  Well, if you can get hydrogen gas, which you can to go transdermal and reduce in that inflammatory process and improve circulation, which I'll also give you the links to some of the grade one, grade two sprain strain injuries that they treat with hydrogen water versus the rice protocol, the rest ice, grass and elevate. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1124.0s)]
*  And how hands down transdermal hydrogen was more effective than ice and compression and elevation. But long story short, John texted me a few weeks later and he's like, man, I can't believe that I'm waking up not in pain. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1145.0s)]
*  Pain free. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1159.0s)]
*  I'm adding a sixth day to my training schedule. Of course he went and dominated his fight, which I take no credit for. And he's announced that he's going to continue fighting. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1160.0s)]
*  And I gave one to Michael Chandler for his last fight. I've given these hydrogen baths to a ton of people. My parents get in it every single day. Both my mother had bilateral knee. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1167.0s)]
*  So this is the equivalent of the cure sort of bathing in the. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1177.0s)]
*  I mean, it sounds like it's true. I'm so high on hydrogen. Nobody's talking about it. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1181.0s)]
*  All right. So someone who has a high inflammatory load and you can measure that and the technology is there. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1187.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1193.0s)]
*  How often are they and how long are they bathing in this? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1194.0s)]
*  25 minutes once a day. So my wife Sage has an L5S1 fusion. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1198.0s)]
*  Shortly before we met a little over 10 years ago, she was in a really bad car accident. Ended up dislodging her L5S1 disk. It degenerated and she had to have a fusion. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1204.0s)]
*  So they went in through an anterior approach, took the disk out, put a spacer in, cadaver bone. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1216.0s)]
*  Ever since then, she's had low back pain, radiculopathy, all of the usual byproducts of L5S1 fusion. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1221.0s)]
*  If she gets in the hydrogen bath for 25 minutes before she goes to bed, she sleeps entirely through the night, pain free. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1231.0s)]
*  If she doesn't, often she's waking up in the middle of the night and having to go stretch or walk around or move it and then get back into bed. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1238.0s)]
*  So I think these modalities where you can replace things like methotrexate and prednisone and anti-inflammatories and corticosteroids. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1246.0s)]
*  That stuff is poison. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1255.0s)]
*  It's so poison. I mean, initially it has an anti-inflammatory response, but it will eat the joint like a termite. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1256.0s)]
*  Yeah. It will solve your problem in the near term and cause you many more in the long term. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1262.0s)]
*  I mean, I think cortisone injections probably ended more careers in professional sports earlier than they should have than maybe any other interventional therapy. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1267.0s)]
*  I want to jump into something that is your passion about and is fundamental, which is methylation. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1276.0s)]
*  Just if you would take us from there. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1286.0s)]
*  You know, I think methylation is... [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1290.0s)]
*  So what is methylation? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1293.0s)]
*  So methylation, also called one carbon metabolism, is essentially the best way I can describe it is it's the process that the human body goes through to take all of the nutrients that enter our body. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1294.0s)]
*  First, we have to understand that there's not a single compound known to mankind. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1304.0s)]
*  No vitamin, mineral, amino acid, fluid, protein, carbohydrate, you know, fat, nothing that we put into the human body that is used in the format that we put it in. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1308.0s)]
*  Most of us know that we actually don't eat to fuel ourselves. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1318.0s)]
*  We eat to feed our bacteria and our bacteria eat to feed us. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1322.0s)]
*  So there's an intermediary between our food and our cellular bio. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1326.0s)]
*  Just to comment on that, right, because it's so important. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1331.0s)]
*  The bacteria in your microbiome determine how foods are digested, how medicines are digested. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1335.0s)]
*  You know, if you've got the wrong bacteria... [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1343.0s)]
*  How much methane, how much... Exactly. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1346.0s)]
*  It really is everything. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1348.0s)]
*  You are a collection of 40 trillion human cells and like 100 trillion bacterial cells, right? [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1349.0s)]
*  So companies like Viome and others help you understand how these bacteria are metabolizing what you eat in the drugs and what works for you. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1355.0s)]
*  A huge fan of Viome and ultimately they're having a positive impact on methylation. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1366.0s)]
*  That's one of the mechanisms that the outcomes of that test impact. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1372.0s)]
*  And so if you, for example, we take in folate or folic acid and this goes through a series of enzymatic reductions [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1377.0s)]
*  and it eventually becomes something called methylfolate or 5-methylfolate, which is the active form. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1388.0s)]
*  I'm going to steal one of your hydrogen tablets while we're here because my battery is dead on this. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1393.0s)]
*  Oh, it is. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1399.0s)]
*  By the way, just for folks, a methyl group is a carbon with three hydrogens, right? [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1400.0s)]
*  And just to connect it back to our space cadets, when people are talking about when Starship is going to land on Mars, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1410.0s)]
*  it's being fueled by liquid oxygen and methane, which is a carbon and four hydrogens. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1418.0s)]
*  So, you know, take a word. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1424.0s)]
*  What's incredible is in microbiology or in chemistry, the difference between the molecular impact of a compound [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1426.0s)]
*  by simply attaching or detaching a methyl group is night and day. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1438.0s)]
*  It's everything. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1443.0s)]
*  So neurotransmitters are activated and deactivated. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1444.0s)]
*  You know, we down regulate neurotransmitters. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1446.0s)]
*  For example, catecholamines, you know, fight or flight neurotransmitters. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1449.0s)]
*  There are genetic mutations that don't allow people to metabolize to break down these neurotransmitters. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1453.0s)]
*  And let me just back up. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1460.0s)]
*  I want to touch on that because it's an important subject. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1461.0s)]
*  But this process of methylation or one carbon metabolism is the process that our body goes to take something from the non-usable form [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1464.0s)]
*  and convert it into the usable form. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1471.0s)]
*  So, for example, if you ingest folic acid, folic acid is useless. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1473.0s)]
*  It does not prevent neural tube defects. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1477.0s)]
*  It doesn't have any other positive effects on the body. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1480.0s)]
*  In fact, folic acid is a manmade compound. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1482.0s)]
*  You can't find it anywhere on the surface of the earth. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1485.0s)]
*  It does not exist naturally in nature. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1487.0s)]
*  Folate does, but folic acid doesn't. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1490.0s)]
*  But regardless, folic acid and folate follow the same enzymatic pathway until they reach one of the primary genes of methylation [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1492.0s)]
*  called the MTHFR gene mutation, the infamous motherfucker gene. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1500.0s)]
*  Can we say motherfucker gene? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1505.0s)]
*  We can. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1506.0s)]
*  We can. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1508.0s)]
*  Understanding your genome and understanding what your MTHFR... [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1509.0s)]
*  44% of your listeners have that gene mutation. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1512.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a problem. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1514.0s)]
*  It is a huge problem. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1516.0s)]
*  And the consequences of this... [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1517.0s)]
*  Meaning you're not properly methylated in your body. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1519.0s)]
*  You're not properly methylated. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1522.0s)]
*  So this is one of the main genes of methylation. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1523.0s)]
*  So our methylation genes will say, okay, we pull crude oil out of the ground, right? [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1525.0s)]
*  But you can't put crude oil into your gas tank. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1530.0s)]
*  And the reason why you can is because the car doesn't understand the fuel source. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1533.0s)]
*  If you can refine crude oil into gasoline, now the car can accept that as a fuel source. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1536.0s)]
*  The human body is no different. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1541.0s)]
*  Our cellular biology does not use folic acid, doesn't use folate. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1542.0s)]
*  It uses the form of folic acid and folate that it is methylated into through the process of methylation, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1545.0s)]
*  which is why if you look at this gene mutation, the MTHFR gene mutation, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1551.0s)]
*  which is probably the most common gene mutation in the world. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1558.0s)]
*  I mean, it's estimated between 44 and 62% of the population has this. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1561.0s)]
*  It doesn't sound like a big deal to not be able to convert folic acid into methylfolate [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1565.0s)]
*  until you realize that folic acid is the most prevalent nutrient in the human diet, right? [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1569.0s)]
*  In the United States, all of our grains, all white flour, bread, pasta, cereals, grains of any kind, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1574.0s)]
*  are sprayed with folic acid. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1580.0s)]
*  We call it fortified or enriched. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1582.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1584.0s)]
*  So fortified or enriched foods are sprayed with chemical folic acid. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1585.0s)]
*  So what happens if you put fortified or enriched foods into the body of somebody who can't process it? [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1587.0s)]
*  Well, now they go nuts. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1592.0s)]
*  So if you look at history of postpartum depression, which for the record can begin during pregnancy, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1595.0s)]
*  most of the women that get postpartum depression have the MTHFR gene mutation. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1601.0s)]
*  They're told by their doctor to take high doses of folic acid, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1609.0s)]
*  1500 to 1800% of the daily allowance of folic acid. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1612.0s)]
*  To overcome the fact that they're not methylated. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1614.0s)]
*  Yes, and this makes it worse. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1616.0s)]
*  And now all of a sudden, because I haven't seen any RCTs, randomized clinical trials, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1618.0s)]
*  linking elevated levels of pregnancy hormones to postpartum depression, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1626.0s)]
*  but we will still blame pregnancy on postpartum depression, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1630.0s)]
*  and we should be blaming it on the high ingestion of folic acid. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1634.0s)]
*  Now, if we gave those women methylfolate, if they took a methylated prenatal vitamin, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1638.0s)]
*  their incidence of postpartum depression would collapse. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1642.0s)]
*  It's not the rise in estrogen going from in the 400s during their normal menstrual cycle [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1646.0s)]
*  to going into the 4000s like you see when they get pregnant. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1652.0s)]
*  That's perfectly normal for estrogen to go up by 10 times, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1655.0s)]
*  bind water in the interstitial space while the uterine wall, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1659.0s)]
*  increase the laxity of the pelvic girdle, all those things that need to happen during pregnancy. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1662.0s)]
*  But then you take 1500 to 1800% of the daily allowance of folic acid [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1669.0s)]
*  because your OB-GYN tells you to do that. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1672.0s)]
*  And the next thing you know, you're going nuts. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1675.0s)]
*  Anxiety, anxiousness, depression, racing thoughts. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1677.0s)]
*  I mean, there's so many people listening to this podcast right now that have that G mutation [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1681.0s)]
*  or they have a genetic mutation called COMT, C-O-M-T, which is another bad one for women. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1686.0s)]
*  Women that have had hormone testing done. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1691.0s)]
*  If they've ever had what I think is the gold standard of women's hormone testing, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1694.0s)]
*  which is called a Dutch test, it's a multi-hour urine test. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1698.0s)]
*  On that test, you will see this genetic mutation, COMT, catecholomethyltransferase. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1702.0s)]
*  And the reason why this particular gene of methylation is important [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1709.0s)]
*  is because it determines a number of things. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1714.0s)]
*  It determines how rapidly or how slowly you break down catecholamines. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1717.0s)]
*  And why that's important is that a rise in catecholamines is anxiety. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1722.0s)]
*  There are so many people that are suffering from anxiety. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1728.0s)]
*  And you hold on to it. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1732.0s)]
*  And the point is that no one's told them what it is. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1734.0s)]
*  If you ask 15 practitioners, what is anxiety, they will describe the characteristics of that condition. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1737.0s)]
*  It's a fear of the future. It's a sense of impending doom. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1744.0s)]
*  It's a sense of fear without the presence of a fear. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1747.0s)]
*  Well, that's all of the things I'm feeling. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1749.0s)]
*  What's causing it? [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1751.0s)]
*  And the majority of people that have anxiety cannot tell you. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1753.0s)]
*  It's not like every time I step on a crowded elevator and I'm claustrophobic, I have a panic attack. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1757.0s)]
*  Or every time I walk to the edge of a 30th floor balcony and I'm afraid of heights, I have a panic attack. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1762.0s)]
*  These are people whose anxiety comes and goes seemingly without a trigger. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1767.0s)]
*  I promise you, you should be investigating that gene, COMT, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1772.0s)]
*  because you may be a slow to break down, to down-regulate these catecholamines, these fight-or-flight neurotransmitters. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1778.0s)]
*  And as they rise, they do three things. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1785.0s)]
*  Number one, they create a waken state. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1788.0s)]
*  And so someone could be sitting having a podcast, just like you and I are right now in a very safe room with our friends right outside the door, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1790.0s)]
*  and just all of a sudden be kind of overwhelmed with anxiety. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1797.0s)]
*  And now what they're going to try to do is relate it to their outside environment. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1801.0s)]
*  Maybe I'm afraid they're going to try to rationalize it. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1805.0s)]
*  You're going to rationalize it, yeah. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1807.0s)]
*  And they're going to try to rationalize it by looking at a cluster of symptoms outside of their body. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1808.0s)]
*  The truth is, if they understood that it's a rise in catecholamines, they could start to take methylated vitamins, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1813.0s)]
*  the complex of B vitamins, methylcobalamin, methylfolate, sometimes CME, S-adenosylmethionine, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1819.0s)]
*  over-the-counter vitamins and nutrients that would then allow them to begin to methylate these neurotransmitters and down-regulate them and calm that down. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1825.0s)]
*  I mean, what I get so excited about is this knowledge. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1838.0s)]
*  This is William Gibson who said, the future is here. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1842.0s)]
*  It's just not evenly distributed. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1845.0s)]
*  And I think that all of this knowledge and cheers to hydrogen water. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1847.0s)]
*  Cheers. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1854.0s)]
*  Take a sip of that. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1855.0s)]
*  Yours is higher apart per million than mine now. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1856.0s)]
*  I'll enjoy it. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1857.0s)]
*  But I think what's fascinating is going to be we're on the brink of a moment in time when all of this knowledge is knowable by anybody, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1860.0s)]
*  not because they happen to listen to this podcast or they've happened to listen to the ultimate human work and media platform that you've built or your books or my books. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1870.0s)]
*  It's because they've turned on their AI health system. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1879.0s)]
*  I agree. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1884.0s)]
*  And that system, I mean, when you're born, you have 3.2 billion letters that guide your life. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1885.0s)]
*  It's your software for the rest of your life unless you do a CRISPR therapy or gene therapy. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1892.0s)]
*  It's there. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1897.0s)]
*  And so that plus the hundreds of subdermal and wearables that are being developed will be able to know at any one moment in time what is your physiological state and how to optimize it. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1898.0s)]
*  And so I've been having this argument recently. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1914.0s)]
*  Let me take my sip of hydrogen water here. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1918.0s)]
*  By the way, I happen to agree with you. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1919.0s)]
*  I think the greatest intersection for humanity is the intersection of artificial intelligence, big data and early detection. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1921.0s)]
*  And, you know, specifically with respect to methylation, I mean, these are 300 billion independent metabolic transactions going on in at any given moment. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1929.0s)]
*  And AI can make sense out of it all. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1942.0s)]
*  When we meet sacks on our own cannot. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1945.0s)]
*  Yeah, I've been having this debate with a number of, shall we say, more old school physicians and scientists that are in the media right now saying, no, you will not make it to 120. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1949.0s)]
*  No, we're not going to bend the health curve. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1963.0s)]
*  And they're absolutely positive. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1966.0s)]
*  And the equivalency for me is the individuals back in the 1890s saying, no, humans will never fly. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1969.0s)]
*  No, we'll never go to the stars. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1976.0s)]
*  What was the Wright brothers that said mankind will never fly from New York to Paris? [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1979.0s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1982.0s)]
*  It was the right. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1983.0s)]
*  I recently did a podcast with Neil deGrasse Tyson and we were talking about 30 year increments of human technological progress. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1984.0s)]
*  And we're talking about the Kitty Hawk flight. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1991.0s)]
*  And then Wilbur Wright goes, you're not making it. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1994.0s)]
*  You'll never make it to Paris. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1997.0s)]
*  And the other thing that Neil said was, oh, by the way, the first real commercial aircraft was the Boeing 707 with conversion. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=1999.0s)]
*  It was the conversion, I think, the KC-135. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2009.0s)]
*  And the length of the wingspan, the 707 was greater than the length of the first Kitty Hawk flight. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2012.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2020.0s)]
*  Which is crazy. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2021.0s)]
*  And we are living in a world where, yes, the history, our history does not necessarily project what our future is going to be. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2023.0s)]
*  And my basic premise, Gary, is we are running billions of chemical reactions per second in 40 trillion cells in the human body. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2032.0s)]
*  And we've never been able to understand that. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2043.0s)]
*  But AI will enable us. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2046.0s)]
*  And there is fundamentally a reason of why aging takes place. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2048.0s)]
*  It's not this random thing. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2053.0s)]
*  Why some people live to 120 and others are dead at 50. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2055.0s)]
*  There's a reason. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2059.0s)]
*  And we're going to be able to understand that and begin to impact that. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2060.0s)]
*  Right. And I think what AI is going to do is because we all know it's multifactorial. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2065.0s)]
*  It's not just methylation. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2069.0s)]
*  It's your detoxification pathways and your transulphuration pathways and how many microtoxins you're ingesting every single day, which we're doing a great job of here in the United States. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2072.0s)]
*  We actually just dropped to 66th in the world in life expectancy on December 6th. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2081.0s)]
*  66th in the world. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2086.0s)]
*  We're below some sub-Saharan South African nations that don't have clean water and sanitation. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2087.0s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2092.0s)]
*  We're number one in health care costs. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2093.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're number one. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2095.0s)]
*  Health care spending. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2096.0s)]
*  Yeah, health care spending. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2097.0s)]
*  And we only really lead the world in seven things. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2098.0s)]
*  And it's morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes, multiple chronic disease, and a single biome. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2100.0s)]
*  Proud to be American. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2105.0s)]
*  Infant mortality, maternal mortality, and what is it? [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2106.0s)]
*  Type 2 diabetes, if I didn't mention that one. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2111.0s)]
*  But it's astounding how much we spend and the outcomes that we're getting. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2114.0s)]
*  But I do agree with you that aging is multifactorial. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2118.0s)]
*  Methylation is absolutely a part of it. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2121.0s)]
*  Whenever I speak to crowds of people or on stages, I'll put up this horrifically confusing chart of methylation. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2124.0s)]
*  It literally looks like somebody took colored spaghetti and threw it against the wall. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2133.0s)]
*  And it shows all of these intricate cellular processes. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2138.0s)]
*  And the only reason why I show that chart is I tell people to look at it for a minute. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2141.0s)]
*  And I say, look at this chart. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2145.0s)]
*  And this is what's going on inside of your cellular biology 300 billion times every day. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2147.0s)]
*  Every time we turn over roughly 300 billion cells a day. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2152.0s)]
*  And this is happening 300 billion times a day. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2156.0s)]
*  Now look at this chart and try to find a chemical, try to find a synthetic, try to find a pharmaceutical. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2159.0s)]
*  You won't find any of those things. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2165.0s)]
*  What you find on that chart are vitamins, minerals, amino acids, nutrients, and... [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2167.0s)]
*  Lego blocks. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2173.0s)]
*  Yes. And so when you start to deplete certain vitamins, minerals, and amino acids, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2174.0s)]
*  when you start to pluck them out of that chart, you can see that the system goes haywire. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2181.0s)]
*  And so many people are suffering from what they think are the consequences of aging. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2186.0s)]
*  Brain fog, weight gain, water retention, poor response to exercise, poor sleep, poor deep sleep, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2192.0s)]
*  you know, all kinds of hormonal imbalance. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2197.0s)]
*  And they think that these are just consequences of aging. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2200.0s)]
*  They're not. They're consequences of missing raw material. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2202.0s)]
*  It is astounding what happens to human beings when you just give their body the raw material it needs to do its job. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2205.0s)]
*  You know, in plant physiology, we believe this, right? [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2210.0s)]
*  If anyone had a leaf rotting in a palm tree or a tree in their yard and a true botanist, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2213.0s)]
*  a true arborist came to their house, they wouldn't even touch the leaf. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2219.0s)]
*  They would core test the soil and they would say, you know what, Peter, there's no nitrogen in the soil. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2222.0s)]
*  And then they would add that nutrient to the soil and the leaf would heal. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2227.0s)]
*  Human beings are no different. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2231.0s)]
*  When we deprive the body of certain raw materials, you know, people get diagnosed with mental illnesses [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2232.0s)]
*  or mood disorders because they're low on serotonin. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2237.0s)]
*  Serotonin is methylated from tryptophan, which is a simple amino acid. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2240.0s)]
*  And in order to methylate tryptophan, the amino acid, into serotonin, which happens in the gut. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2244.0s)]
*  About 90% of our serotonin in our bodies is in our gut. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2249.0s)]
*  And if you don't have it here, you can't have it here. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2252.0s)]
*  It travels up the vagus nerve. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2255.0s)]
*  But what happens in the gut is deficiencies in amino acids and deficiencies in the complex of B vitamins [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2258.0s)]
*  that cause this methylation process to occur to convert tryptophan into serotonin [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2264.0s)]
*  or to convert phenylalanine and tyrosine into dopamine. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2269.0s)]
*  And once you have the deficiencies in these neurotransmitters, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2272.0s)]
*  now you can't assemble moods and emotional states that require these neurotransmitters. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2275.0s)]
*  So you get told that you have a mood disorder or you have a mental illness. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2279.0s)]
*  And now you're down the bandwagon of chemicals or synthetics to reduce certain synaptic uptakes of neurotransmitters. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2283.0s)]
*  When really you have deficiencies that are born out of a lack of nutrients. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2293.0s)]
*  That's why I'm so fascinated by methylation. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2298.0s)]
*  And of course, methylation of our DNA is also how we control what genes are on and what genes are off. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2300.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's also how we know that genes are not necessarily our destiny. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2307.0s)]
*  It might be our previous position. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2311.0s)]
*  I love this slide. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2313.0s)]
*  Let's turn to some of the fun toys in your bedroom and your incredible penthouse apartment. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2315.0s)]
*  So this is a red light bed and there are a multitude of them. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2325.0s)]
*  And like you said, this typically will run you 100k or so. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2330.0s)]
*  Talk about this. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2333.0s)]
*  So I'm a huge, huge fan of red light therapy. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2334.0s)]
*  Let me also tell your listeners, you don't need to run out and spend 100 grand on a red light bed. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2338.0s)]
*  You can Google around and find... [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2342.0s)]
*  There are red light panels. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2344.0s)]
*  There are red light panels. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2345.0s)]
*  There are smaller red light beds. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2347.0s)]
*  There are other ways to get red light. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2349.0s)]
*  You can usually find a clinic in your area that will allow you to use these things on a membership basis. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2351.0s)]
*  Or at the very least, you can expose your skin to sunlight because we are very photovoltaic beings. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2356.0s)]
*  You and I were just sitting here in Southern California and we were both outside just soaking in the sun. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2363.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2369.0s)]
*  We just did it just now. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2370.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2371.0s)]
*  And so I always... [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2372.0s)]
*  So what do you think, what do you normally, when someone says, hey, why, how often are you hanging out in a red light bed? [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2374.0s)]
*  How long and what does it do for you? [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2380.0s)]
*  Ten minutes a day, every day, seven days a week if I can. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2383.0s)]
*  You know, I have it in a separate room in the house and I have this sort of pattern that I go through. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2387.0s)]
*  I wake up in the morning, brush my teeth, splash water on my face. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2393.0s)]
*  What time do you wake up? [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2396.0s)]
*  Between 6 and 6.30, latest. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2397.0s)]
*  I usually try to be up with first light. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2399.0s)]
*  So I'm really intentional about trying to get first light. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2402.0s)]
*  In fact, we're out in LA now and we rented an Airbnb. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2406.0s)]
*  I actually found a ladder behind the Airbnb. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2409.0s)]
*  So I put it up over the... [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2411.0s)]
*  There are three roofs on this house and I put it up on the low roof and I climbed up on that and got on the second one, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2413.0s)]
*  then got on the third one and I did my breath work up there on the rooftop in the morning because it's nice and cool here. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2418.0s)]
*  It's like in the high 40s. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2423.0s)]
*  So I just took my shirt off and did some breath work up there. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2424.0s)]
*  But exposing your skin to sunlight is... [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2428.0s)]
*  I don't want to say the poor man's red light, but it is the best way to get light therapy. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2431.0s)]
*  But red light does a number of things. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2436.0s)]
*  There are a number of therapeutic wavelengths. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2439.0s)]
*  First of all, light can be very damaging or can be very therapeutic in the body. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2441.0s)]
*  If you look at the light spectrum, you know, starting with something like X-ray, which is light, these are very damaging. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2445.0s)]
*  Moving to UVA, UVB, which are the damaging rays from the sun that cause light. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2451.0s)]
*  They cause skin cancer. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2457.0s)]
*  And then there's a very narrow spectrum of light, very, very narrow spectrum of light, which is the visible light spectrum. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2459.0s)]
*  The reds, the orange, yellow, green, what is it? Blue indigo and violet. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2465.0s)]
*  Yes, ROYGBIV. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2468.0s)]
*  Yeah, ROYGBIV. I remember that still from biology. That's what I was playing in my head. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2470.0s)]
*  ROYGBIV. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2474.0s)]
*  And then after that, you can do infrared and near infrared. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2476.0s)]
*  And what happens in these wavelengths from red to infrared and this near infrared is that when these wavelengths of light [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2478.0s)]
*  pass through the body, one of the most powerful things that red light does is it goes into your mitochondria [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2486.0s)]
*  and it kicks out a gas called mitochondrial nitric oxide. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2493.0s)]
*  And so it kicks out nitric oxide and it forces oxygen to dock. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2497.0s)]
*  So there is a part of the Krebs cycle inside of the mitochondria where oxygen docks called cytochrome C oxidase. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2502.0s)]
*  And you want to think of cytochrome C oxidase as a one-armed man. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2509.0s)]
*  He can either shake hands with nitric oxide or he can shake hands with oxygen, but he can't do both. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2513.0s)]
*  If you can get cytochrome C oxidase to bind to oxygen, you can upstage the mitochondria. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2518.0s)]
*  You can improve its production of adenosine triphosphate at the ATP. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2525.0s)]
*  We know that aerobic respiration yields 36 ATP. We know that anaerobic respiration yields 2 ATP. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2529.0s)]
*  So an ATP is what really powers human beings. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2535.0s)]
*  Take me back to seventh grade and to medical school. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2538.0s)]
*  It's all about the mitochondria. So not to get over complicated, but what red light will do is it will kick out this gas and force oxygen to dock. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2541.0s)]
*  So that is already a battery charger for your cellular biology. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2548.0s)]
*  It literally charges you up like a battery. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2554.0s)]
*  We also know that certain wavelengths of red light are, these are mostly the visible spectrum of lights because they're very superficial, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2557.0s)]
*  are excellent for collagen, for elastin, for fibrin. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2566.0s)]
*  It also, back to the vasomotor circulation and vasomotion, it has a positive impact on both vasomotor and vasomotion. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2570.0s)]
*  And there are numerous clinical studies in the public literature on PubMed, and I'll have my team link them here, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2578.0s)]
*  on the improvement of eyesight because it improves microvascular circulation to the back of the eye. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2585.0s)]
*  There are several cataract studies involving red light therapy. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2593.0s)]
*  So when you're in a red light bed, do you need to shield your eyes? [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2596.0s)]
*  No, I leave my eyes open. These red light beds will have all four and sometimes five wavelengths. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2601.0s)]
*  I use one called LumaPod Pro. It's got 45,000 light diodes. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2606.0s)]
*  It has five wavelengths of light, a typical session is 10 minutes. You could do it for 20 minutes. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2614.0s)]
*  And you're not only improving collagen, elastin, fibrin in your skin, you're improving microvascular circulation, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2620.0s)]
*  you're reducing inflammation, you're charging up your mitochondria. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2625.0s)]
*  I mean, I think that and the hydrogen nanobath would be my two go-tos. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2629.0s)]
*  So I use a red light panel because I've also got a red light cap on my head for stimulating circulation and hair growth. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2634.0s)]
*  I'm using a red light oral device as well. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2644.0s)]
*  I've seen those. It looks like a tongue device. Is that by Neuronic? [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2648.0s)]
*  No. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2652.0s)]
*  Because Neuronic makes these helmets that actually go transcranial. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2653.0s)]
*  No, this is both red light and blue light. This is impacting the pathogens in my mouth. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2657.0s)]
*  I've gotten so focused on oral health because people should know your mouth and the bacteria [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2663.0s)]
*  and other pathogens in your mouth are a capillary away from your brain. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2671.0s)]
*  Yes, and not too many capillaries away from your heart. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2677.0s)]
*  And what's interesting is some of the bacteria that create calcification, hydroxyapatite, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2681.0s)]
*  we find in cavitations in the mouth, but we also find them in calcium in the heart. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2687.0s)]
*  And I think most people think that these hard plaques, like our bones, are calcium and they're actually not. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2694.0s)]
*  They're calcium combined with phosphorus, which is forming something called hydroxyapatite, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2700.0s)]
*  very similar to what's in our teeth. And in order for that to form, you need something like an osteoblast that creates bone [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2705.0s)]
*  or you need a bacteria that can combine calcium and phosphorus to form this hydroxyapatite, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2714.0s)]
*  which you find in cavitations in your mouth. I'm a huge fan of seeing a quality biologic dentist [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2719.0s)]
*  if you've had a root canal and getting that cleaned out. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2726.0s)]
*  Testing your oral microbiome to understand, do you have any of the pathogens there that are really dangerous? [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2729.0s)]
*  I'm actually waiting for a tooth right now and that's to be gross, but... [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2736.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2739.0s)]
*  See that guys? [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2740.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2741.0s)]
*  Wait, waiting for it in what respect? Regrowing it? [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2742.0s)]
*  No, so I had a root canal here and I went to a biologic dentist named Dr. Jagar Gandhi, phenomenal biologic dentist. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2745.0s)]
*  As far as I'm concerned, he's probably the best in the country. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2754.0s)]
*  I cracked a tooth one day in the back of my mouth on the other side and I called him and I said, I hate the dentist. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2757.0s)]
*  Yeah, who loves dentists? [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2764.0s)]
*  I hate dentists. Sorry, Dr. Gandhi. And I called him and I said, dude, I've got to come up and see you, man. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2766.0s)]
*  I cracked this tooth in my mouth and he goes, take a picture of it. And so I snap a picture of it. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2774.0s)]
*  And he goes, oh, that's your 19th tooth meridian. He goes, do you ever get left anterior shoulder pain? [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2780.0s)]
*  No shit. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2786.0s)]
*  And I go, I swear to God, I did a whole podcast with him. I was so fascinated by it because I'm pretty like woke to like what's going on in the wellness. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2787.0s)]
*  I watch everything goes in my mouth. I'm in red light. I'm drinking hydro. I'm doing all this stuff. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2795.0s)]
*  And I go, you know, that's weird. I actually do get left anterior shoulder pain. I thought it was like a bicep tendonitis or something. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2799.0s)]
*  It wasn't like enough for me to go to the urgent care or something. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2806.0s)]
*  And then he said, do you ever get left lower lobe lung pain? He was that specific. I go, dude, you are freaking me out. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2810.0s)]
*  Whenever I do hits cardio, I have a catch right here in my rib. I just thought it was like a runner's cramp or something. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2819.0s)]
*  And then he was super freaked me out because he said, does your left toe ever go numb? [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2826.0s)]
*  No, come on. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2832.0s)]
*  Right hand to God. It didn't go numb, but it would tingle and itch. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2833.0s)]
*  And my wife used to tease me because I would take my shoe off and I would itch my big toe and then I would put my shoe back on or I'd be talking to somebody and I would just tap it. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2839.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2846.0s)]
*  And because it would feel like it was going numb. And he goes, yeah, that's your 19th tooth meridian. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2847.0s)]
*  And he sent me this chart and it mapped to the meridian. He's like, yeah, you had a root canal in that tooth. And I was like, I did actually. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2851.0s)]
*  And he said, come up, we'll do this cone beam x-ray. We'll check for cavitation. So I went up and they did this 360 x-ray. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2858.0s)]
*  He actually found several of them, but two of those were in root canals. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2864.0s)]
*  And I posted this on my Instagram because I was so fascinated by what he was able to predict by this meridian. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2870.0s)]
*  And then when he took my tooth out, there was this little balloon on the bottom of the tooth. It's getting gross. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2876.0s)]
*  So if you're squeamish. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2881.0s)]
*  Caution for the viewers. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2883.0s)]
*  He took a, I go, what is that? He goes, oh, that's a cavitation. That's a pus filled sack with bacteria and parasites. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2884.0s)]
*  I said, no way. I have no pain. I have no symptoms. I have no inflammation. I have no gum bleeding and nothing. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2891.0s)]
*  So he pops it, puts it on a slide and we dark field it in his office. And I posted this video. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2897.0s)]
*  You could see my macrophages going after the parasites and going after the bacteria. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2903.0s)]
*  I mean, I was horrified by it. And so he cleaned it all out, ran red light in there, put a platelet rich fiber in. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2909.0s)]
*  Let's just stop right here and tell people you're the health of your mouth is so critically important. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2915.0s)]
*  So you're 50, what now? 54. 54. I'm 63. And I wish I had started paying attention even earlier in my life. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2923.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is people ignore it. They go to the dentist because they have to when they have it, you know, that's fine. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2931.0s)]
*  But there is so much more that you could be doing in terms of, of, of, you know, using an electric toothbrush. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2937.0s)]
*  I have actually have a device flossing. I actually have a device. I'm it's called Proclaim. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2943.0s)]
*  I don't know if you know this, you go in, your mouth gets scanned and it's a mouthpiece that has a jet in between every single tooth. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2950.0s)]
*  And so it is like high energy, high speed water pick flossing in 30 seconds. You put this in your mouth. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2959.0s)]
*  I love it. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2967.0s)]
*  You put this in your mouth. I know you put this in your mouth. You know, you bite down like you would a mouth guard. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2968.0s)]
*  And like this whole container of water just gets pumped in through all of those and your mouth is clean. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2974.0s)]
*  So, I mean, it's amazing. Right. And then there's another product that they changed the name recently, [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2982.0s)]
*  which is a toothbrush with a very similar structure. But it's with all of these brushes that you basically clumped down on it and it brushes everything. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2988.0s)]
*  So, I mean, I remember I knew Jeff Bezos 45 years ago and when he was purely a space kid that before Amazon and then he and I reconnected. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=2997.0s)]
*  And I was talking to him about XPRIZE and space and all. And one day I said, Hey, is there any chance you can come and speak at this event? [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3008.0s)]
*  This is like 20 years ago. And he goes, Peter, I'm so short on time. I'm trying to optimize my toothbrush time, my toothbrush time. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3016.0s)]
*  And I said, OK, I get that. But this is what you're actually doing. You're able to like, you know, take those 15 minutes, 10 minutes and make them much more efficient. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3025.0s)]
*  The technology is there. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3033.0s)]
*  Technology is definitely there. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3034.0s)]
*  But more importantly, going to a biological dentist to check out the fluorine fine on your mouth. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3035.0s)]
*  Highly recommended. So then this tooth, which I'm waiting on, he also pulled this one, cleaned it out, red light, ozone gas. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3041.0s)]
*  Yes, ozone gas, exactly. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3050.0s)]
*  Which is wild. When they take the tooth out, it doesn't even bleed. And that's a bad sign. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3051.0s)]
*  And so he runs the ozone gas and the red light and increases the perimeter of the hole until you get fresh red blood. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3056.0s)]
*  And he packs your own platelet-rich fibrin in there, your own platelets. And he puts the stitches it shut, the bone grows shut. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3065.0s)]
*  And then he puts the, I believe it's a porcelain implant. I mean, he doesn't use any metal. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3073.0s)]
*  And now I just got to go back up and have the tooth put on there. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3078.0s)]
*  But I think he's one of the best things I ever did. And I just can't believe that that just flew by me. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3081.0s)]
*  But he also uses red light, not a full red light bed, but he uses those red light. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3086.0s)]
*  About 13 years ago, I had my two kids, my two boys. And I remember at that moment in time, I made a decision to double down on my health. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3092.0s)]
*  Without question, I wanted to see their kids, their grandkids. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3101.0s)]
*  And really, during this extraordinary time where the space frontier and AI and crypto is all exploding, it was like the most exciting time ever to be alive. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3106.0s)]
*  And I made a decision to double down on my health. And I've done that in three key areas. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3115.0s)]
*  The first is going every year for a fountain upload. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3121.0s)]
*  Fountain is one of the most advanced diagnostics and therapeutics companies. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3126.0s)]
*  I go there, upload myself, digitize myself, about 200 gigabytes of data that the AI system is able to look at to catch disease at inception. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3130.0s)]
*  Look for any cardiovascular, any cancer, neurodegenerative disease, any metabolic disease. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3140.0s)]
*  These things are all going on all the time and you can prevent them if you can find them at inception. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3146.0s)]
*  So super important. So fountain is one of my keys. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3152.0s)]
*  I make it available to the CEOs of all my companies, my family members, because health is in you wealth. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3155.0s)]
*  But beyond that, we are a collection of 40 trillion human cells and about another 100 trillion bacterial cells, fungi, viri. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3162.0s)]
*  And we don't understand how that impacts us. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3172.0s)]
*  And so I use a company and a product called Viome. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3176.0s)]
*  And Viome has a technology called Metatranscriptomics. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3179.0s)]
*  It was actually developed in New Mexico, the same place where the nuclear bomb was developed, as a biodefense weapon. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3184.0s)]
*  And their technology is able to help you understand what's going on in your body, to understand which bacteria are producing which proteins. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3192.0s)]
*  And as a consequence of that, what foods are your superfoods that are best for you to eat? [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3202.0s)]
*  Or what food should you avoid? Right. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3207.0s)]
*  What's going on in your oral microbiome? [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3210.0s)]
*  So I use their testing to understand my foods, understand my medicines, understand my supplements. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3213.0s)]
*  And Viome really helps me understand from a biological and data standpoint, what's best for me. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3220.0s)]
*  And then finally, you know, feeling good, being intelligent, moving well is critical, but looking good. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3227.0s)]
*  When you look yourself in the mirror saying, you know, I feel great about life is so important. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3233.0s)]
*  Right. And so a product I use every day, twice a day is called OneSkin, developed by four incredible Ph.D. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3238.0s)]
*  women that found this 10 amino acid peptide that's able to zap senile cells in your skin and really help you stay youthful in your look and appearance. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3246.0s)]
*  So for me, these are three technologies I love and I use all the time. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3258.0s)]
*  I'll have my team link to those in the show notes down below. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3263.0s)]
*  Please check them out. Anyway, hope you enjoyed that. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3267.0s)]
*  Now back to the episode. Let's jump into Saunas. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3270.0s)]
*  I just bought a portable infrared sauna, which is the size of a chair that I can hop into. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3273.0s)]
*  You just kind of zip it up. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3283.0s)]
*  You zip it up. But I mean, this is a full on sauna. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3284.0s)]
*  Talk to me about your sauna practices. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3287.0s)]
*  So sauna is one of the best ways to activate your detoxification pathways. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3289.0s)]
*  You know, if you talk to any functional medicine practitioner where they're trying to detox somebody from anything, mold, mycotoxins, pathogens, you know, bacteria, metals, [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3295.0s)]
*  they will tell you that sauna and sweating, both infrared and near infrared, I mean, sorry, both infrared and dry sauna has to be a part of your regular routine. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3305.0s)]
*  So I'll usually put a liter of fluid through myself after I get out of the sauna. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3318.0s)]
*  I have a dry sauna. I actually have my parents who've been staying with me for several weeks. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3323.0s)]
*  I met them. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3330.0s)]
*  Yeah, you did. That's right. They were there. We knew they're still staying with me. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3331.0s)]
*  So Captain John Brekka and Judy Brekka. Mom has bilateral knee replacements. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3334.0s)]
*  Dad had a very bad boating accident years ago, which left him with hemiparalysis on one side of his body. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3338.0s)]
*  So both of them are rather deconditioned from a physical standpoint. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3344.0s)]
*  And so I was following Dr. Otto Warburg's work in multi-step oxygen therapy or EWOD, exercise with oxygen therapy. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3347.0s)]
*  And since it's difficult for them to get their heart rate up, I'll put both of them in the sauna and I'll run a nasal cannula under the door and they'll just breathe high PPM oxygen for about 20 minutes. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3355.0s)]
*  And the difference in their cognitive function, even immediately after getting out of the sauna, they would both tell you, is night and day. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3368.0s)]
*  My mom's a chatterbox and so is my dad. You just feel clear and clean, cognizant, awake. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3376.0s)]
*  So my wife and I do sauna regularly. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3382.0s)]
*  How long, how many days a week? [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3385.0s)]
*  20 minutes, minimum three times a week. It's something we really like to do. It's right next to our bathroom. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3388.0s)]
*  And so she and I will very often end the day in there together and they'll get out of the sauna and I'll do just a 20 or 30 second cold plunge, not a long cold plunge, but a 20 or 30 second cold plunge and I'll dry off. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3394.0s)]
*  And that's proved to be quite a little sleep hack for me. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3407.0s)]
*  I mean, people could do it with a contrast shower too, a hot shower followed by a cold shower, especially if you're one of those people that ruminates. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3410.0s)]
*  If your environment quiets and your mind wakes up and you have ruminating thoughts or you just replay the day or you go through your grocery list and all of that, but sauna is excellent for detoxification. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3418.0s)]
*  Steam room? [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3429.0s)]
*  So steam room is... [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3431.0s)]
*  If you had to choose between sauna and steam room. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3432.0s)]
*  If I had to choose between sauna and steam room, I would probably choose sauna and here's why. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3434.0s)]
*  I think most commercial steam rooms are not filtering the municipal water when they bring it into the steam room. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3439.0s)]
*  So you're vaporizing chlorine gas, fluoride gas, microplastics, pharmaceuticals, polyfluoroalkyls, these PFAs, which are very, very high in the municipal water supply in Miami. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3444.0s)]
*  So unless you are certain that they are running that through preferably like a forged stage reverse osmosis filter or some other type of micron filtration, which I do at the house, I don't trust a lot of steam rooms. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3455.0s)]
*  So my preference is not to breathe vaporized fluoride and chlorine, but it can be even more effective at heating the body up than sauna. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3469.0s)]
*  Remember, water is 29 times more thermogenic than air. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3480.0s)]
*  Yes. And what you mean by that is its ability to take away or provide heat. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3483.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. Like you can die in 72 degree water. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3488.0s)]
*  Heat capacity. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3490.0s)]
*  You can't get hypothermia in 72 degree air, right? Your body can maintain the temperature gradient. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3491.0s)]
*  So I have both steam and sauna, but I actually use a reverse osmosis and charcoal filter when it comes to the house. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3496.0s)]
*  I saw it. I saw the closet. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3503.0s)]
*  Yeah. And then I have another step down filter. I'm such a psycho. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3504.0s)]
*  And then that's a cold plunge. That's one of my favorites. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3507.0s)]
*  Here's the thing about cold plunging. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3511.0s)]
*  There's no evidence that I've seen that colder is better or longer is better. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3513.0s)]
*  Three minutes minimum, six minutes maximum, 50 degrees Fahrenheit is plenty. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3518.0s)]
*  You know, you get a peripheral vasoconstriction, which, you know, drives all the blood into the core, liver, lungs, pancreas, kidneys up to the brain. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3523.0s)]
*  You also get a really interesting activation of brown fat, which is different than white fat. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3529.0s)]
*  It exchanges a, it's our thermostat, you know, essentially exchanges a calorie for a measure of heat. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3536.0s)]
*  So you mean to tell me that when I get cold, my body is going to use calories and turn it into heat? [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3542.0s)]
*  Yes. There is a cost to having your body temperature return to normal. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3547.0s)]
*  Let's not forget if you're in 50 degree water and you get out and you're in 70 degree air, your body's still going back to 98.6. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3552.0s)]
*  So how does your body continue to raise your temperature? [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3561.0s)]
*  There's a cost to that. It's not free. And the cost is calories, increased caloric expenditure. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3565.0s)]
*  And so brown fat turns calories into heat. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3571.0s)]
*  And by the way, one of the things that I think is important is the small hacks of increasing your caloric expenditure. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3574.0s)]
*  Right. So I'm going to point out those who are joining us on YouTube here. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3582.0s)]
*  Gary's wearing this beautiful little vest that looks like it's just a normal vest, but it's a 10 pound, 10 pound or 10 kilograms? [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3587.0s)]
*  It's 10 pounds. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3595.0s)]
*  10 pound vest. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3596.0s)]
*  10 kilograms I'd probably notice, but 10 pound vest. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3597.0s)]
*  And I tried it on and it really felt slightly heavier. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3599.0s)]
*  It feels kind of snug. If you ever use a weighted blanket, it feels good. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3606.0s)]
*  And you said that your estimate on your particular muscle mass and caloric expenditure that you're thinking, wearing this during the day. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3610.0s)]
*  Close to 600 calories if I wear it for 10, 12 hours. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3618.0s)]
*  Which like I said, it's a big mac. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3622.0s)]
*  It's significant. I don't say wear a weighted vest and get a big mac. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3624.0s)]
*  But I'm a big fan of rocking too. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3628.0s)]
*  And I've got the, I think it's Rogue where you put the plates in the front, the plates in the back. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3632.0s)]
*  But it kind of hangs over your shoulders. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3638.0s)]
*  That's actually a large commitment. This was super easy. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3640.0s)]
*  Super bulky. These guys at AION, I think they pronounce it I-on, they make these weighted vests that actually zip snug to your body. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3643.0s)]
*  You can use during workouts or they make these more decorative ones you can just wear if you're just walking through the airport. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3653.0s)]
*  And it looks very handsome. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3660.0s)]
*  I'm traveling. I'm just trying to bio stack things. I'm like, well, I'm going to be walking anyway. I might as well add weight. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3662.0s)]
*  And by the way, one of those mental hacks here, and I keep on reminding people of this, is it's like take the stairs instead of the escalator. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3666.0s)]
*  If you need to park, if you're having a difficulty finding a parking spot, park two blocks or three blocks away. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3674.0s)]
*  And think of it as free exercise. You're not paying a trainer to give you. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3681.0s)]
*  Yeah. My wife and I played that game at the airport. You know, we always try to find the stairs and not the escalator. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3685.0s)]
*  What's amazing is they have this moving walkways and they're actually called moving walkways, but people turn them into moving standways. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3691.0s)]
*  And they just get on them and they just sort of ride. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3697.0s)]
*  You know, and they get off and walk four feet to the other one. Lazy bastards. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3699.0s)]
*  I actually love a good walk in the airport before I get on a plane because I fit. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3703.0s)]
*  Absolutely. And so I will not go on the moving walkways. I will actually try and keep up with everybody by walking faster on the side. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3706.0s)]
*  So cold plunge, you said something interesting a second ago, which is it doesn't have to be that cold. It does not be that long. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3714.0s)]
*  So if you're in the shower in my typical practice, because I don't have a cold plunge. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3721.0s)]
*  I thought I just saw one out there. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3729.0s)]
*  Well, I do, but this is I'm not always around here at the studio, but there is there's a sauna, a cold plunge right there. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3731.0s)]
*  But I will take my hot shower and then for the last 60 seconds, take it to as cold as possible. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3740.0s)]
*  Absolutely. That's the other thing. I mean, again, you know, all these modalities are great, but people can take Tupperware containers, freeze large blocks of ice in their freezer, throw them in their bathtub. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3747.0s)]
*  It's good for about three days. If you cut a couple of these big blocks, your water will stay cold for three days. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3759.0s)]
*  You know, and it's a great way to make a cold plunge because, you know, even if you're just buying ice from 7-Eleven, eventually that adds up. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3764.0s)]
*  So you can freeze these. That's a great hack. Yeah. You freeze these and you drop them in. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3771.0s)]
*  You know, just like I said, you can access a lot of these modalities, you know, sunlight, grounding, breath work, you know, cold plunge for little or next to nothing. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3775.0s)]
*  But the other thing that, you know, I was about to mention was the release of something called cold shock proteins, which are specialized proteins released from your liver. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3786.0s)]
*  There's a lot of research now looking at cold shock proteins and a lot of these benefits. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3794.0s)]
*  And there's a few in particular, LIN-28A and LIN-28B, which are implicated in the improvement of insulin resistance. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3799.0s)]
*  So making you more sensitive to insulin, they scour the body of free radical oxidation. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3812.0s)]
*  There's some evidence that they improve protein synthesis, you know, the rate of muscle repair. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3817.0s)]
*  And so just think in three minutes, you get a dopamine spike, a peripheral vasoconstriction, you know, an activation of brown fat and a release of cold shock proteins. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3823.0s)]
*  Three minutes and get out. I mean, and that's why you feel I call it my drug of choice because you feel so good for so long. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3832.0s)]
*  And you don't have to get into 35 degree water and you don't have to go for 12 minutes. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3839.0s)]
*  I see people online, you know, going underwater with snorkels in 37 degree weather. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3845.0s)]
*  That's a macho move. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3849.0s)]
*  I'm like, man, that's just not a good idea. Your brain's only this far inside the surface of your skull. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3850.0s)]
*  All right. So I want to talk about hyperbaric oxygen because I've seen and heard miraculous results and mixed results. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3854.0s)]
*  And I'll tell you where that's coming from. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3865.0s)]
*  And and so there's there's a therapeutic level and a hobbyist level. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3866.0s)]
*  Right. So let's talk. So this is a hobbyist version. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3872.0s)]
*  I actually have one of these soft shell chambers, one point three atmospheres. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3875.0s)]
*  It goes to about one point three, one point four. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3879.0s)]
*  The hobbyists will go around one point three atmospheres, which is good. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3881.0s)]
*  But as I've gone deep down the rabbit hole of hyperbaric and I'm sold on hyperbaric, I'm actually building my podcast studio inside of a hyperbaric right now. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3886.0s)]
*  So February, middle of February, I'll have the first ever podcast studio inside of a hyperbaric. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3894.0s)]
*  I'm coming back on your show. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3901.0s)]
*  If you're on the ultimate human, we're going to be doing in a hyperbaric. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3902.0s)]
*  But if you look at the majority of the research on hyperbaric oxygen therapy, it's done at two atmospheres or greater. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3907.0s)]
*  Yes. What I found, sadly, is that most of the soft shell chambers will borrow that research. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3913.0s)]
*  You know, as outcomes for soft shell chambers. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3922.0s)]
*  Now, I have a soft shell chamber. I'm not shitting on those guys. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3925.0s)]
*  But, you know, it it mimics deep sleep. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3929.0s)]
*  It can actually be not a replacement for but an adjunct to, you know, poor sleep. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3933.0s)]
*  My wife all the time, she does not get a good night's sleep. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3938.0s)]
*  She'll wake up and she'll go spend an hour in the hyperbaric, breathe 92 to 95 percent O2 through a nasal canvass. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3941.0s)]
*  And then you are switched on. If you've ever done hyperbaric therapy, even at 1.3 atmospheres, you feel amazing after you get out of there and you've been breathing that oxygen. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3947.0s)]
*  But the compressed gas at two atmospheres and I've just started to go way down the rabbit hole in hyperbaric oxygen therapy. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3956.0s)]
*  I have one of the top experts in the world come to the house to help me design some protocols because my concern is that I become adaptive. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3965.0s)]
*  Right. And, you know, we can adapt to altitude. We could also adapt to hyperoxemia. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3973.0s)]
*  And I also use hydrogen tablets to offset the oxidative free radicals from hyperbaric. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3979.0s)]
*  Which is one of the questions I was going to ask because you're driving oxygen, which is an oxidative force into your body. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3988.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is an oxidative stressor. And so but the hydrogen gas offsets that. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=3995.0s)]
*  So I do another one of those hydrogen bombs, you know, four or five of those H2 tabs. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4000.0s)]
*  I'll drop those in water. I'll put down 750 milliliters of water. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4005.0s)]
*  And then I get in the hyperbaric. And I'm telling you, you feel like you took a limitless pill. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4009.0s)]
*  You're so cognizant, so clear, so awake, so alert. It comes very close to mimicking deep sleep. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4014.0s)]
*  And so if you're sleep deprived, you know, hyperbaric, it's excellent for wound healing. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4022.0s)]
*  It's excellent for circulation. It's excellent for cognitive function. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4027.0s)]
*  I put both of my parents in a hyperbaric chamber. I'm super excited about the podcast studio. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4030.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't know why you don't sleep in there. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4035.0s)]
*  Michael Jackson used to sleep in there. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4038.0s)]
*  Well, he's not doing so well right now. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4041.0s)]
*  He's not doing so good. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4043.0s)]
*  But interestingly enough, I was in Israel. I met the team that did the original work. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4044.0s)]
*  That's where all the good research comes out of. Right. And good cognitive function work. Yeah. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4049.0s)]
*  And a whole slew of different repairs. Like if you've had a stroke, if you've had any kind of neurodegenerative disease, [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4053.0s)]
*  it really is stimulating neuronal growth in an amazing fashion. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4060.0s)]
*  But my concern is their work is premised on a significant amount of time in those hyperbaric chambers. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4066.0s)]
*  And I'm stealing, I'm going back to Jeff Bezos's, I'm trying to optimize my tooth brushing time right now. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4074.0s)]
*  Well, that's why I built the studio in the hyperbaric. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4080.0s)]
*  Because I was like, I don't have 90 minutes. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4082.0s)]
*  Not everybody can do that. I don't know that I have an hour. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4084.0s)]
*  And if I had an extra hour, I don't know that I would spend it like this. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4086.0s)]
*  I wouldn't either. Yeah. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4090.0s)]
*  Yeah. I wouldn't say a hyperbaric would make my top three modalities. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4091.0s)]
*  Now, if God forbid I should have had a stroke or something, then I'm all in. It's like getting- [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4098.0s)]
*  100%. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4105.0s)]
*  Or if post-surgical recovery, this is also one of my favorites. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4107.0s)]
*  So, HOCAT. What's the HOCAT stand for? [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4111.0s)]
*  So, that's a hyperthermic oxygen carbonic acid transdermal therapy. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4113.0s)]
*  So, it's a mouthful. But basically, a HOCAT is transdermal ozone. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4119.0s)]
*  So, ozone can be infused into the bloodstream transdermally. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4123.0s)]
*  I'm a huge fan of ozone mold, microtoxins, metals, glyphosate. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4128.0s)]
*  I remember during COVID, one of the many physicians I went to- [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4137.0s)]
*  One of the most effective therapies. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4142.0s)]
*  I had IV. I'd take my blood out, circulate it with ozone, and then put it back in. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4143.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. So, there's multiple ways you could do ozone. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4149.0s)]
*  You could just take an ozonator and put the air into a syringe, and you can hang an IV bag below the level of the heart, [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4153.0s)]
*  allow the blood to drain into a sterile IV bag, and then add the ozone gas to the IV or to the blood. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4162.0s)]
*  You'll see the blood go from like a Cabernet wine to a bright red as red blood cells take up that oxygen. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4169.0s)]
*  And then you can infuse that back in. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4176.0s)]
*  Now, ozone's O3, so there's an oxygen. It's an O2. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4179.0s)]
*  It is the ultimate oxidator. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4183.0s)]
*  It is the ultimate oxidator. And that third oxygen molecule is one of the most reactive species known. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4184.0s)]
*  It's like a missile to free radicals in oxidation. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4190.0s)]
*  And so, we happen to live in the mold capital of the world, in Miami. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4194.0s)]
*  And so, I don't think I've seen anything as effective for mold toxicity as ozone. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4198.0s)]
*  And then you can do what's called 10-pass ozone, which is where it's pulled into a glass vial and agitated with ozone and put back in and pulled out and put back in. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4207.0s)]
*  There's a very advanced form of ozone called EBO2. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4219.0s)]
*  I haven't heard about that. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4223.0s)]
*  So, EBO2 is extra blood corporal ozone. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4224.0s)]
*  It sounds actually like what I did during COVID. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4228.0s)]
*  If it had a filter, that's what it was. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4234.0s)]
*  So, essentially, the blood comes out. It comes out of one arm. It goes back in the other arm. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4236.0s)]
*  It comes out. It goes through a filter. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4241.0s)]
*  And this is a filter that's designed to remove BPAs, these bisphenols. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4245.0s)]
*  It will remove mold spores, mycotoxins. It will remove metals. It will remove microplastics and glyphosate. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4252.0s)]
*  And as it passes through the filter, it's also ozonated. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4261.0s)]
*  And the ozone gas is added to that. And then it's circulated around and comes back in. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4265.0s)]
*  Sometimes they also pass it through a light filter. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4269.0s)]
*  So, EBO2 is probably, in my opinion, the most advanced. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4272.0s)]
*  If you have a mold, mycotoxin, metals, something like that, and you can't get down to Tijuana to do an extra blood filter, then EBO2 is a great choice. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4275.0s)]
*  That machine, the previous one you were showing, will actually... [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4289.0s)]
*  So what that does, those doors close. They close around your neck. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4293.0s)]
*  And it will steam you up like a steam room. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4296.0s)]
*  And then it will release ozone gas into the chamber. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4299.0s)]
*  First, it releases CO2 gas. CO2 is carbon dioxide. It's the main vasodilator in the human body. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4302.0s)]
*  People think it's nitric oxide. It's not. Nitric oxide is actually a caustic gas because it competes for oxygen. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4308.0s)]
*  I wouldn't take any kind of nitric oxide supplement on purpose. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4314.0s)]
*  But the reason why we get vascular during... [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4317.0s)]
*  You wouldn't do nitric oxide tablets for increasing NO2 in your vaso, your vasoconstriction? [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4320.0s)]
*  No. Never on purpose. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4330.0s)]
*  I mean, there's a great book called The Ultimate Guide to Methylene Blue. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4332.0s)]
*  He goes deep down the rabbit hole of nitric oxide as an oxidative free radical. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4336.0s)]
*  And then also its implication in all kinds of neuropathic disorders, including Alzheimer's, early onset dementia, cognitive decline, autism, learning disabilities. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4344.0s)]
*  Nitric oxide will compete with cytochrome C oxidase for oxygen. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4357.0s)]
*  And so anytime we are depriving the mitochondria of oxygen, that's a bad thing. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4364.0s)]
*  In fact, when you do red light, you release the nitric oxide, which will go into the vascular wall and cause a, we say vasodilation. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4370.0s)]
*  It's really a vasorelaxation effect in the arterial wall. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4380.0s)]
*  So you do get some increased circulation, but you also get the benefit of the oxygen. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4384.0s)]
*  But this has also rife frequency in it. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4389.0s)]
*  So you put your feet on rife frequency plates and you can select different modalities. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4392.0s)]
*  So you could select thyroid, immune system, adenoids, what have you. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4396.0s)]
*  But it runs carbon dioxide to dilate the blood vessels and dilate your pores. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4401.0s)]
*  And then it will run transdermal ozone. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4405.0s)]
*  And that goes right transdermal, right into the bloodstream. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4408.0s)]
*  And I'm telling you, that will shift you from a sympathetic to a parasympathetic state like nothing you've ever done in your life. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4411.0s)]
*  You are so relaxed and zen getting out of that thing. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4417.0s)]
*  That's great. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4421.0s)]
*  All right, we got the Balancer Pro here. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4423.0s)]
*  Those are just very expensive compression gear, but they work. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4425.0s)]
*  Okay, so this is a vascular muscular compression. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4429.0s)]
*  Yeah, so this is mainly lymphatic compression. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4432.0s)]
*  You know, a lot of the compression gear, people think that the more pressure, the better. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4434.0s)]
*  And that's absolutely not the case with lymphatic circulation. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4438.0s)]
*  You know, there's no pressure again behind the lymphatic system. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4441.0s)]
*  It's a static system, so it needs muscular contraction in order for it to flow. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4444.0s)]
*  So it needs motion and activity. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4448.0s)]
*  So these Balancer Pros, they'll start at your feet and they'll actually very rhythmically and gently, [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4450.0s)]
*  and the pressure will slowly increase, they will push all of the lymphatic fluid up into the dermal vein. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4456.0s)]
*  Like toothpaste through a tube. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4462.0s)]
*  Yeah, like toothpaste through a tube. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4464.0s)]
*  All right, PEMF, pulsed electromagnetic field therapy. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4466.0s)]
*  People swear by it. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4472.0s)]
*  I swear by it. I have one in my bag. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4474.0s)]
*  So PEMF, pulsed electromagnetic field, so this is one of those modalities where you can use high-frequency PEMF, [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4476.0s)]
*  which it can actually cause a muscle contraction and is really good for muscle spasms, muscle soreness, [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4484.0s)]
*  recovering from joint injuries. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4491.0s)]
*  But as a daily modality, you want to use something called a low-gauss PEMF, GAUS, [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4493.0s)]
*  which is a current measurement, similar to the surface of the earth as a low-gauss current. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4500.0s)]
*  It's a magnetic field measure. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4504.0s)]
*  Yeah, magnetic field, sorry, measure. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4506.0s)]
*  Does this go under your sheets of your bed? [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4508.0s)]
*  Yeah, so you can put it right under the sheets of your bed and pull the sheets over top of it. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4511.0s)]
*  I have an eight-sleep mattress that'll blast right through that. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4515.0s)]
*  And what it will do is it'll just run a low-gauss current through the body, low-gauss field, sorry, through the body. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4518.0s)]
*  And what this low-gauss field does, and you can measure this. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4524.0s)]
*  You can dark-field your blood. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4527.0s)]
*  You can measure the outcome of a red lightbed. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4529.0s)]
*  You can actually do nitric oxide strip testing before you get in and when you get out. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4533.0s)]
*  And you can prove that your red lightbed is working. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4538.0s)]
*  Before you get in the red lightbed, just put a nitric oxide test strip in your mouth, [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4540.0s)]
*  which you can get for like six bucks on Amazon. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4545.0s)]
*  It'll be like a pale pink. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4547.0s)]
*  And then you'll lay in the bed for 15 or 20 minutes, wait about 10 or 15 minutes, and do it again. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4549.0s)]
*  And you'll see that your nitric oxide levels are working. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4554.0s)]
*  Nice. I knew that. I had those bedside. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4556.0s)]
*  Yeah. But what this will do is repolarize the surface of your cells. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4558.0s)]
*  So I think they call it RULO when the red blood cells start to stack and stick together. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4563.0s)]
*  When cellular surfaces have similar charges, they repel. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4568.0s)]
*  When they have opposite charges, they attract. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4572.0s)]
*  Everywhere that they touch, you lose surface area to exchange with the outside environment. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4574.0s)]
*  So now you're comparing this cell's capacity to eliminate waste or repair or detoxify or regenerate. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4578.0s)]
*  So what a pulsed electromagnetic field will do is it will restore that surface polarity. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4584.0s)]
*  And you can see this pre and post PEMF. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4589.0s)]
*  By the way, you can see it pre and post grounding as well. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4592.0s)]
*  People think that grounding and earthing is like voodoo science. It's not. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4597.0s)]
*  If you don't have the budget for a PEMF, Matt, take your shoes off and touch the surface of the earth. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4600.0s)]
*  What does one of these put send you back here? [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4607.0s)]
*  So this one will run you about five grand. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4609.0s)]
*  But it really works. If you look at the coils, they go from the top to the bottom. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4612.0s)]
*  Yeah. So I have an eight sleep mattress and this will, this goes underneath. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4616.0s)]
*  It'll go right under the eight sleep. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4622.0s)]
*  The thing I love about the eight sleep is there's no EMF in that. It's just the coils in the bed. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4623.0s)]
*  I get markedly better sleep when I use the eight sleep too. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4628.0s)]
*  And again, like you, I'm just trying to condense time. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4633.0s)]
*  Like how can I bio stack these? I can lay down, I can run pulse electromagnetic field, which is mimicking. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4636.0s)]
*  This will be on my buy list after this. Yeah, for sure. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4641.0s)]
*  And then the eight sleep. But these are these low gauss current mats are phenomenal for restoring cellular polarity. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4644.0s)]
*  Fantastic. I'll just add a few of these. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4656.0s)]
*  I'm usually wearing a continuous glucose monitor and it's not. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4660.0s)]
*  It drove me crazy when I wore CGM. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4665.0s)]
*  It's for no other reason than to gamify what I eat. That's basically it. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4667.0s)]
*  Have you gotten used to seeing what? [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4673.0s)]
*  Yeah. So my game is, and so, you know, I'm not wearing it today. I should have, but the battery ran out two days ago. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4675.0s)]
*  I've got a stack. I moved out of my house because of the, you know, the fires. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4684.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4689.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, no, I was on the edge of the Santa Monica and Pacific Palisades. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4690.0s)]
*  So the house is now, I've been out of it for three weeks and we have remediation to get all the smoke there out. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4693.0s)]
*  Anyway, long story short, so a lot of my stuff is there, [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4703.0s)]
*  but I wear it simply to see how low I can keep my blood glucose from spiking throughout the day. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4706.0s)]
*  I mean, that's basically it. And it's fun to see that and fun to play that game. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4714.0s)]
*  Yeah. And do you see what happens if you eat high glycemic carbs? [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4720.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's like, it's like, it's just not worth it. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4723.0s)]
*  It's interesting, right? Because I will say, okay, if I eat that, I'm going to spike it and I'm not going to be happy about that. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4725.0s)]
*  So it just creates a hack. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4730.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4731.0s)]
*  It's like, we'll talk about the Oro Ring in a second, which I'm wearing. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4732.0s)]
*  And the only, you know, Oro Ring is not going to help you get to sleep better, [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4734.0s)]
*  but at night when I'm going to sleep, I know if I, so I've pretty much given up most alcohol. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4739.0s)]
*  I'll have like a sip of red wine, something like that. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4748.0s)]
*  But if I should ever drink a glass of alcohol, my Oro score will plummet or if I go to sleep late, it will plummet. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4750.0s)]
*  So CGM for me, it's super easy, fun, gamify what I eat. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4760.0s)]
*  Here's the Oro Ring I got last night in preparation for you. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4765.0s)]
*  I got like one of my high scores at 95. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4769.0s)]
*  You did? Nice. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4773.0s)]
*  So one of the things that's interesting, that's what I get here. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4774.0s)]
*  That's great. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4777.0s)]
*  What time do you go to bed? [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4778.0s)]
*  I went to bed at 8 45 PM. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4780.0s)]
*  And I tell you, that is everything. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4782.0s)]
*  It is everything. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4787.0s)]
*  Everything that we discussed matters little compared to sleep. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4788.0s)]
*  And it's like when I go to sleep impacts everything for us today. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4794.0s)]
*  And I used to be a night owl where it'd be up till midnight, one or two o'clock. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4798.0s)]
*  And my wife and my friends like, you know, you don't go out and party with us. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4803.0s)]
*  Well, you know, it's yes, true. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4807.0s)]
*  But I get up at five and I write. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4809.0s)]
*  And so last night I got an hour and a half of REM and an hour and 15 of deep sleep. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4812.0s)]
*  You get up and you write or you write, you said? [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4819.0s)]
*  I write. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4821.0s)]
*  Oh, you write, yeah. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4822.0s)]
*  I write. It's like my first two hours are mine. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4823.0s)]
*  So good. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4825.0s)]
*  But the Oro Ring doesn't give you a good night's sleep. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4826.0s)]
*  It does gamify the fact that if I eat too late, if I drink too much water too late, [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4829.0s)]
*  I have to get up and urinate. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4838.0s)]
*  If I go to sleep too late, it's like I'm going to have a shitty score in the morning. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4839.0s)]
*  You know that if you eat too close to bedtime, if you drink at all, you know, any of those things. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4844.0s)]
*  So I get a sleep score on my eight sleep mattress as well. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4849.0s)]
*  My eight sleep always gives me hundreds. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4854.0s)]
*  My Oro Ring is a harder grader. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4856.0s)]
*  Yeah, same with whoop. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4859.0s)]
*  It's usually they're usually within I wear a whoop. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4860.0s)]
*  I actually am charging right now. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4862.0s)]
*  I think Aura and whoop both do the same thing. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4866.0s)]
*  You can disconnect the Bluetooth at night and then it will upload in the morning, which I like. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4869.0s)]
*  But the eight sleep is always slightly better than my whoop, but usually is not demonstratively. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4873.0s)]
*  It's like 96, 97, 96, 98. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4881.0s)]
*  I feel like it grades on a higher curve. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4884.0s)]
*  But it was like one of the earliest investors in Aura when it first came out. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4887.0s)]
*  And the Oro Ring used to be this giant like scarab size thing on your finger. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4892.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're beautiful. That's it right there. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4897.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, this is the Gen 3 that's out now. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4898.0s)]
*  But when you think about the amount of integrated electronics and circuitry in there, right? [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4902.0s)]
*  It is mind-blowing. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4908.0s)]
*  It's got four or five days of battery. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4909.0s)]
*  It's got a multitude of sensors and lasers and Bluetooth. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4911.0s)]
*  I mean, it is amazing. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4916.0s)]
*  It's the beginning of what we're going to see in the wearables revolution. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4918.0s)]
*  Well, when this integrates with labs, genetic testing, body scans, all of these different modalities, [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4922.0s)]
*  when AI is able to pull all of that into one place. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4932.0s)]
*  The thing I'm really a fan of wearables for is Aura, whoop. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4936.0s)]
*  These guys can do studies that I think are more important than individual randomized clinical trials. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4943.0s)]
*  Because when you take six people or eight people and you send them to the University of Miami to do a sleep study [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4952.0s)]
*  and they walk into a sterile room that's like two clicks shy of a jail cell, [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4957.0s)]
*  you put the monitors all over their body and you tell them to go to sleep. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4960.0s)]
*  Versus you get a thousand people or five thousand or ten thousand people to opt into a study with whoop or with Aura. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4963.0s)]
*  And you're studying them in their own environment or in their own family sleeping in their own bed and in their own habitual pattern. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4970.0s)]
*  I think you get better data. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4976.0s)]
*  You do. It's amazing. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4978.0s)]
*  Eventually, there will be implantables. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4980.0s)]
*  I've got a, if you feel this right over here, there's a little glass capsule in there. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4983.0s)]
*  You're next level. What is that? Dude, what is going on there? [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4990.0s)]
*  That's my business card. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4993.0s)]
*  Is it really? [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4995.0s)]
*  Yeah, I've been chipped. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4996.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4997.0s)]
*  So I was on stage. I was on stage in Amsterdam at Singularity University event. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=4998.0s)]
*  And the guy was there showing the future of implantables. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5004.0s)]
*  This is like 12 years ago, really early on. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5009.0s)]
*  That's how long that's been in there. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5012.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's been in there. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5013.0s)]
*  And so it's a non-bioreactive glass and inside is a near field reading device, so a NRF. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5014.0s)]
*  And it's like when you chip a dog, and you can read, that's what this has my business card on it. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5024.0s)]
*  But eventually, it will be measuring everything, not on the surface, but subdermally. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5030.0s)]
*  And so these are coming. My venture fund, we've invested a number of these. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5038.0s)]
*  Really? Yeah, that's so fascinating. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5042.0s)]
*  Tonal, I love the device for its ease of use and it's all about consistency. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5044.0s)]
*  It's all about consistency. I use an in-body. I love the devices. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5051.0s)]
*  Oh, to measure your... [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5056.0s)]
*  Yeah, and again, it's gamified. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5057.0s)]
*  So last year, I focused on adding 10 pounds of muscle mass, and it was like consistency in the gym, five days, if I could, six days, creatine, 150 grams of protein, because I weigh 150 pounds. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5059.0s)]
*  And it was like just measure, measure, measure, measure, measure to play that game. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5071.0s)]
*  And you have to want to play the game. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5076.0s)]
*  Yeah, but you also have to enjoy it. You've got to have trackable things to track it like this. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5078.0s)]
*  Yeah. And then I love my Manta sleep mask. This is the... [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5084.0s)]
*  I use one every now and then. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5089.0s)]
*  There are three versions of it. This is the most advanced version with speakers in it. I actually don't use this one. It's a little bit heavier, but I can't sleep without it. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5090.0s)]
*  I can't sleep without a sleep mask either. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5101.0s)]
*  I also use a, I don't have it on the list here, but a mandibular advancement device. It is a upper and lower device that moves the jaw forward, the mandible, that opens up the airway, keeps you from grinding my teeth, and the oar ring, the Manta, the H sleep, those are my sleep kit. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5103.0s)]
*  You're like, I am just throwing as many hacks as possible. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5125.0s)]
*  It's like I travel with this stuff. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5128.0s)]
*  Yeah, I do too. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5130.0s)]
*  And my slippers. I've got my slippers on at home. And that's, you know, we talked about the H sleep cooling mattress. And it's really, for me, maintaining that body temperature at, you know, I put it... [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5131.0s)]
*  I'm fascinated by how much of an impact just slight changes in temperature variation have at holding you in, because I notice I will sleep the same length of time, but my REM and deep scores will not be as much. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5146.0s)]
*  And when I look back at what the H sleep is doing, changing its temperature to hold you in deep sleep, to hold you in REM sleep. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5160.0s)]
*  I mean, honestly, how it even knows that is wild to me. But it, you know, my whoop will validate that as well. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5168.0s)]
*  And people should know on your sleep, there are two important phases, right? There's your deep sleep, which typically occurs in the first half of your night's sleep cycle. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5177.0s)]
*  And your deep sleep is where your glymphatic system is clearing proteins, toxic proteins in your brain. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5189.0s)]
*  And if you have to choose, you know, deep sleep is, I think, more critically important for our long-term health. REM is where you're consolidating memories. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5197.0s)]
*  And REM will typically occur in the later stage of your sleep cycle. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5205.0s)]
*  Right. If you are getting good deep sleep, but you wake up four hours after you start, you might get an hour. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5209.0s)]
*  You know, I try and get at least an hour of deep sleep and at least an hour of REM sleep is my goal. And it's hard to control that. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5216.0s)]
*  The only way I control it is no alcohol, no food for a couple hours before and getting asleep early. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5223.0s)]
*  And when I do that, I'm typically get into that great cycle. But if I wake up after a shortened sleep, the deep sleep's there, but the REM has been eliminated. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5230.0s)]
*  Yeah. So, you know, I'd like to wrap with a conversation on a technology that we're both passionate about, which came out of DARPA called Extera and their filter. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5240.0s)]
*  So I'm going to have Extera on stage with me at the Abundance Summit, you know, this year for the first time. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5258.0s)]
*  So every year at the Abundance Summit, which I hold in March, I've got, you know, a day on AI, a day on exponential technologies, a day on moonshots, a day on longevity. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5265.0s)]
*  And this is the first year that I'm really going from a focus on diagnostics to a focused on advanced therapeutics. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5276.0s)]
*  Tech to enable you to extend your life and to really cure, prevent diseases is finally coming online right now. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5285.0s)]
*  I'm a huge believer in the Extera. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5295.0s)]
*  Yeah. So talk about it, please. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5297.0s)]
*  So I did a podcast with Dr. Mink Chawla. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5299.0s)]
*  Yeah, the CMO, the Chief Medical Officer. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5303.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's the Chief Medical Officer there and it's worth a watch if... [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5305.0s)]
*  And please, the Ultimate Human Podcast. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5309.0s)]
*  The Ultimate Human Podcast. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5313.0s)]
*  So Dr. Chawla is a nephrologist. He was an ICU septic specialist. You know, one of the challenges in ICU is that people get sepsis. It's pretty common. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5315.0s)]
*  Bacteria in your blood. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5324.0s)]
*  Bacteria in your blood. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5326.0s)]
*  Very painful, very dangerous. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5327.0s)]
*  I mean, it's sometimes not painful because you're not conscious, but very, very dangerous nonetheless. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5329.0s)]
*  And part of what happens is you can shut your kidneys down. So he was a nephrologist. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5334.0s)]
*  So obviously he's been studying how the blood is filtered throughout his entire career. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5338.0s)]
*  He's also published some unearthly amount of peer-reviewed studies. It's well in excess of 100. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5343.0s)]
*  And he's a sweetheart guy. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5349.0s)]
*  He's a sweetheart of a guy. I mean, he's literally one of my favorite humans and I've been talking to him about spike protein detox. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5350.0s)]
*  And so this filtration system that he's co-developed has not just filters, which most filters are filtered based on size. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5357.0s)]
*  Right? So a filter will be a step-down filter. It will have progressively decreasing size. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5369.0s)]
*  Size pores that things can get through. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5375.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. And so you're filtering things out by size. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5377.0s)]
*  But when you're filtering the blood and you're filtering it by size, like you want to get down to the size of the micron size of a virus, [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5380.0s)]
*  well, now you're going to take platelets and you're going to take all kinds of growth factors. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5388.0s)]
*  You're going to take all kinds of positive, useful things out of the bloodstream. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5393.0s)]
*  So what you'd prefer to do is creating a binding affinity. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5398.0s)]
*  And if you could selectively create an affinity that attracted things like viruses, [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5402.0s)]
*  mycotoxins, circulating tumor cells, which is fascinating to me that you can get circulating tumor cells, bisphenols, microplastics. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5409.0s)]
*  And you could create this binding affinity. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5419.0s)]
*  And essentially what these heparin binding sites do, aside from increase the surface area inside this filter, [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5422.0s)]
*  is they sort of mimic the wall of the artery, the glycocalyx. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5429.0s)]
*  The glycocalyx, yes. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5433.0s)]
*  And so, which a lot of pathogens have a natural affinity for because that's how you leave the blood and enter the tissue. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5434.0s)]
*  The way when he was speaking at my longevity platinum trip, he said, [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5442.0s)]
*  Listen, you typically have these things that are circulating through your blood. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5447.0s)]
*  And if they're trying to attack you, they need to attach to the surface of the blood vessel and then enter through that. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5452.0s)]
*  And our blood vessels are coated with this glycocalyx, this large protein structure. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5462.0s)]
*  And he built this filter, you call it the sephora? [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5466.0s)]
*  Serif. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5472.0s)]
*  Serif, serif filter. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5473.0s)]
*  And the number I remember, it's a tennis court size surface area of this glycocalyx protein that your blood flows through. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5474.0s)]
*  And so if your blood has any kind of viruses, and we are constantly building up these viral loads. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5482.0s)]
*  Oh, thousand percent. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5489.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, we were talking before the podcast, and I'm a big fan of this sort of emerging viewpoint that aging is this process of immunofatigue. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5490.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5501.0s)]
*  Immuno exhaustion. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5502.0s)]
*  Immuno exhaustion. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5503.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5504.0s)]
*  So it's, you know, the immune system is just fighting on too many fronts. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5505.0s)]
*  You know, eventually, we're sort of micro poisoning ourselves to death. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5509.0s)]
*  We're bathing our cellular biology in this toxic soup. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5513.0s)]
*  Even those of us that are trying, are best not to. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5516.0s)]
*  And if you could filter these pathogenic compounds, including a lot of the inflammatory compounds out of the human, out of the bloodstream. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5520.0s)]
*  Now, all of a sudden you give your immune system a leg up, you know, so, you know, so mold, micro toxins, viruses. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5529.0s)]
*  You know, they have some really interesting data on long COVID and, you know, 27 million people report suffering from long COVID. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5537.0s)]
*  They can filter long COVID out of your blood in two or three filters. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5544.0s)]
*  It's, it's incredible. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5547.0s)]
*  Which is astounding. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5548.0s)]
*  That gives somebody their life back. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5549.0s)]
*  It does. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5550.0s)]
*  And the way I think about it is the following. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5551.0s)]
*  We are living in this world of embedded with viruses and we get a, we might get a CMV. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5556.0s)]
*  We might get a Epstein-Barr virus. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5565.0s)]
*  I shingled. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5568.0s)]
*  Yeah. All of these viruses and they don't go away. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5571.0s)]
*  They're embedded in your cell, in your DNA and they flare up. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5574.0s)]
*  Literally wound into your DNA. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5578.0s)]
*  And, and it turns out your innate immune system, your natural killer cells are there and they have two primary functions. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5580.0s)]
*  One is they're looking for cells infected by viruses and killing those cells. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5588.0s)]
*  The other one is they're looking for cancer cells. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5594.0s)]
*  The same natural killer cells. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5597.0s)]
*  And if you are bombarding your body with these embedded viruses that you're getting and you get a cold and you get COVID on top of that, [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5599.0s)]
*  you exhaust it to the point where it cannot battle on all these fronts. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5608.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5612.0s)]
*  And so when you put one of these filters and you literally are taking the blood out of your body, you're filtering it over this tennis court size of glycocalyx, all of those, those, you know, pathogen. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5613.0s)]
*  Circulating tumor cells, pathogen. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5627.0s)]
*  Get pulled out and you return to your blood. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5629.0s)]
*  And then your immune system is like, ah, it's a field day. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5631.0s)]
*  We're going to sweep up all the guys that are left. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5634.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5636.0s)]
*  I think it would be a great treatment to do before you did biologics. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5637.0s)]
*  So if you were doing stem cells or exosomes or a natural killer cell treatment or one of the other advanced biologic treatments to actually have a clean slate. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5640.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5648.0s)]
*  You know, one of the things that we do for, you know, athletes and other folks that are leaving the country to go do stem cell treatments, as we say, well, let's take 10 weeks and really get your blood as clean as we can. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5649.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5659.0s)]
*  So it's lower. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5660.0s)]
*  You don't want to hit your body with stem cell treatments if you've got any kind of cancer in your body or anything that the stem cells could activate a continuous growth of. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5661.0s)]
*  Yeah. And not only that, you don't want to do it if you have, you know, hyperinsulinemia, but, you know, a lot of pro-inflammatory cytokines or, you know, very high C-reactive protein, high homocysteine. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5672.0s)]
*  These, you know, stem cells have an affinity to, for inflammation and you want the inflammation to be in the areas where you need the stem cells to go to work, not just sort of dispersing once they get to the bloodstream. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5683.0s)]
*  Yeah. Buddy, tell everybody where they can find you. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5695.0s)]
*  My first and last name, just at Gary Brekka on Instagram or at The Ultimate Human. My podcast is The Ultimate Human. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5699.0s)]
*  I have a community. I write a free newsletter every week. I write challenges and guides. I host free challenges about every other month, cold plunge challenges, breath work challenges, whole food challenges, gut challenges, all kinds of things. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5708.0s)]
*  And people go through a community, with a community, go through that challenge together. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5724.0s)]
*  I have a paid community that's $97 a month. I do four private podcasts a month with that community, do a lot of one-on-one, like, you know, Q&As, bring lots of special guests on there. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5728.0s)]
*  I've had Dana White, Jelly Roll, Stephen A. Smith, you know, lots and lots of fun folks on our challenges. I have a free challenge coming up in February, which is my morning routine challenge. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5740.0s)]
*  Nice. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5751.0s)]
*  The science of morning routines, the science of circadian rhythm. I stay with them for three days. We're actually measuring sleep scores. It's a really, really cool, fun, active, engaged community. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5752.0s)]
*  And, you know, listen, if you want to make a change in your life, doing this with a community is the number one way to do it. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5763.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5771.0s)]
*  For sure. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5772.0s)]
*  And that's what we're trying to do. That's what we are doing at The Ultimate Human is just building a community, and we call them The Ultimate Human VIPs. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5773.0s)]
*  So you can go to theultimatehuman.com, read what it would be like to become an Ultimate Human VIP. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5779.0s)]
*  So I'm back in Miami, end of February, the FII Summit is happening down there. I'm coming through to play with your toys. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5785.0s)]
*  Let's do it, man. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5793.0s)]
*  Thank you, buddy. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5795.0s)]
*  We'll do a podcast in the hyperbaric chamber. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5796.0s)]
*  Oh, I love that. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5798.0s)]
*  All right. Awesome, Peter. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5800.0s)]
*  All right. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR4oWQuCXSA&t=5801.0s)]
