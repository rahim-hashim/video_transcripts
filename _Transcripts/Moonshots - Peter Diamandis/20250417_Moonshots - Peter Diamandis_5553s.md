# Why This Billionaire Is Bringing Back the Dire Wolf, Woolly Mammoth & More w/ Ben Lamm & Salim | 165
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY)
*  The howl of a dire wolf hasn't been heard on planet Earth for more than 10,000 years. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=0.0s)]
*  13,000 years after the last dire wolf walked the Earth, scientists say they've now brought [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  them back. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=12.32s)]
*  Ben, I have to say you pulled off what I think is the scientific miracle of the decade. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=13.32s)]
*  What's your roadmap here, pal? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=19.44s)]
*  So we're working on the man with, we're working on the Tasmanian tiger, we're working on the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=20.44s)]
*  dodo. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=23.48s)]
*  I think we could save every species on the planet. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=24.48s)]
*  Save every species on the planet, that's pretty extraordinary. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=26.36s)]
*  Alright, so be extinction 101, and remember I'm not a scientist. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=29.6s)]
*  I'm really curious and I feel like I like to ask questions. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=31.96s)]
*  I don't know anything about it, so I can ask, you know, childlike questions about it and [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  then I get these answers. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  One of the spin outs I can't wait for you to talk about is the idea of artificial wounds. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  I think that if we continue on the current course and speed by the end of 2026, we will [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=47.6s)]
*  have the world's first mammal birth fully ex utero. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=53.36s)]
*  This provides a bridge to future developments like this that will break open all sorts of [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=57.28s)]
*  potential. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=62.04s)]
*  What's the next species that we can look forward to? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=63.04s)]
*  Now that's the moonshot, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=65.52s)]
*  Everybody welcome to Moonshots. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=75.0s)]
*  I'm here with two incredible entrepreneurs and two dear friends, Salim Ismail, head of [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=76.0s)]
*  exponential organizations who you all know and love, and Ben Lam, the founder, CEO of [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=81.76s)]
*  Colossal Biosciences. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=88.36s)]
*  Colossal has been all over the news around the world. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=91.04s)]
*  One of the top stories in April, the cover of Time Magazine. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  And Ben, I have to say, you pulled off what I think is the scientific miracle of the decade. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  Seeing Elon capture the super heavy booster on Starship was sort of the technological [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=109.75999999999999s)]
*  miracle, but bringing back the dire wolf. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=115.47999999999999s)]
*  And so what I put out a blog yesterday, because I was really pissed off about this, this incredible [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  achievement of bringing back to the planet Earth after over 10,000 years of extinction, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=125.0s)]
*  three dire wolf pups. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=132.84s)]
*  And a lot of people said amazing, but there were way too many people saying, is this real? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=135.48s)]
*  Is this crazy? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=141.96s)]
*  What is this guy doing? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=143.4s)]
*  And to those haters out there, listen to this episode because I think this is an extraordinary [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=145.76s)]
*  achievement that heralds a future of synthetic biology that's going to blow our minds as [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=151.0s)]
*  much as AI is blowing our minds today. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=158.62s)]
*  So Ben, how are you feeling about this? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=162.0s)]
*  What was all this controversy about? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=164.28s)]
*  Well, I feel great. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=166.92s)]
*  I've got weird tough skin, right? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=171.16s)]
*  I think that if anyone thought they were going to go into the de-extinction world, which [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=174.56s)]
*  involves conservation, synthetic biology, AI, there's actually about 31 different ways [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  to classify an animal. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=188.44s)]
*  You're dabbling into an area where a lot of people have a lot of opinions on a lot of [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=190.8s)]
*  different topics. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=195.92s)]
*  So I think that it would have been really naive to think that you're going to go into [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=196.92s)]
*  something like this and not have a lot of skepticism and a lot of negative feedback [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=203.0s)]
*  from the start. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=208.0s)]
*  And then it's only going to get worse as you're successful, right? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=209.16s)]
*  It doesn't go the other way. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=213.16s)]
*  And so we've talked about this for a long time. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=214.8s)]
*  What happens when we actually start to show the world animals? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=217.9s)]
*  How does that feel? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=221.62s)]
*  But I feel fantastic. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=222.62s)]
*  The team feels fantastic. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=224.62s)]
*  I think the only, and I'll talk about the controversy, the only thing that I think is [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=226.02s)]
*  a little sad in my mind, I think you nailed it in your blog post, is that people miss [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=230.18s)]
*  the science. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=236.34s)]
*  People miss the fact, I'm sure we'll go into it today, but it's like, and look, I'm not [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=239.02s)]
*  a scientist or it doesn't affect me. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=242.74s)]
*  I sleep fine at night. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=245.5s)]
*  You know, we had these incredible women and men that have spent the last, you know, 18 [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=246.9s)]
*  months, seven days a week, passionately in love with bringing back the direwolf. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=252.1s)]
*  And whether you want to classify it as a direwolf or colossal's direwolf or a genetically modified [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=257.3s)]
*  gray wolf, whatever you want to do, which we'll get into that conversation at some point, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=262.78s)]
*  that doesn't matter. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=267.3s)]
*  The fact that they took 72,000 year old DNA from a skull and 13,000 year old DNA from [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=268.46000000000004s)]
*  a tooth mapped it and built a nearly complete direwolf genome, which before this, there [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=277.42s)]
*  was only 0.15% coverage, right, of the genome to go to nearly complete genome and to then [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=283.66s)]
*  select the genes that drove the core phenotypes of a direwolf, engineer it into a gray wolf [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=294.3s)]
*  cell, which for many don't know this, it is the closest living relative. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=300.22s)]
*  It's not the closest relative. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=304.22s)]
*  It's the closest living relative on the planet, which is a non-model species, by the way. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=305.5s)]
*  No one's ever done this. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=309.98s)]
*  And then to clone that where you have a healthy birth of animals that exude phenotypes or [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=311.42s)]
*  physical attributes that are driven by genes that have been lost for 12,000 years, it's [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=318.54s)]
*  magic. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=324.3s)]
*  It's a miracle. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=325.3s)]
*  It's a miracle. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=326.3s)]
*  And people just like, and not to mention just the genome engineering, right? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=327.3s)]
*  So on our mouse, we announced the one mouse a couple of months ago and we had eight edits [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=330.90000000000003s)]
*  in seven genes and we did it all at once using multiplex editing, meaning we did it all at [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=336.86s)]
*  once, 100% delivery, 100% efficiency, zero off-target effects. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=341.5s)]
*  That's a miracle. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=347.46s)]
*  And yet we did get feedback on that. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=348.46s)]
*  There's like people have made eight edits before, but yeah, they made them sequentially [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=350.02s)]
*  over eight generations. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=353.35999999999996s)]
*  And so to go from eight edits to 20 edits, now using 15 of those edits being ancient [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=354.82s)]
*  DNA variants, it's awesome. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=361.46s)]
*  And so the only thing that I was sad about is I don't really care what people call it, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=363.9s)]
*  right? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=367.21999999999997s)]
*  I'm not asking people to go to our website or watch our videos. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=368.21999999999997s)]
*  I don't really care. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=370.38s)]
*  I think it's sad for the scientists that at a minimum, I think people could have elevated [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=372.14000000000004s)]
*  the incredible work by the women and men at Colossal and our academic contributors to [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=378.70000000000005s)]
*  the project. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=383.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=384.66s)]
*  Salim, what question comes and pops out at you? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=385.66s)]
*  I mean, you saw the press going back and forth. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=388.06s)]
*  I did and I read your blog post, I thought that was phenomenally detailed. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=391.3s)]
*  I've been tracking this for a while. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=395.22s)]
*  We first talked about this at Singularity University and the way we used to frame it [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=397.46000000000004s)]
*  was, and this is going back 10, 15, 10, 12 years ago, was we essentially can now navigate [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=400.68s)]
*  conservation in a completely different way, in a totally different mindset. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=409.2s)]
*  And there's some magic that comes from that. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=413.92s)]
*  So I've got 100 questions, including as a company, your business model. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=416.2s)]
*  My biggest question though is how? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=421.14s)]
*  Because a lot of people have tried this in the past and I'd love for you to give our [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=423.8s)]
*  sense of how you went about this because this provides a bridge to future developments like [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=427.76000000000005s)]
*  this that will break open all sorts of potential. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=433.24s)]
*  And I'd love for you to give some sense of the methodology you used. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=436.6s)]
*  Let me inject one thing here, which is really important, that this idea of de-extinction [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=439.32000000000005s)]
*  is not just four years old, right? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=447.6s)]
*  So Ben, you co-founded with George Church, who's the scientific genius at Harvard Medical [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=450.04s)]
*  School, a dear friend of both of ours, I dare say a very, very close friend of yours [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=455.32s)]
*  at this point. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=462.28s)]
*  But he's been dreaming about it for many years and it's been discussed for decades and it [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=463.96s)]
*  hasn't happened. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=469.24s)]
*  It's just now, in the last four years, that the tech exists. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=470.38s)]
*  But I would say there's another thing that exists right now and for those moonshot entrepreneurs [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=475.8s)]
*  I want you to hear this, it's the difference that a CEO can make, the difference that a [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=481.28000000000003s)]
*  moonshot CEO can make in taking something from theory and making it real. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=488.28000000000003s)]
*  And Ben, of course, you've got multiple PhDs in biology and CRISPR and gene editing, right? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=495.08000000000004s)]
*  I mean, your background is... [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=500.88000000000005s)]
*  I have no background in biology whatsoever. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=501.88000000000005s)]
*  I know, that's the key point. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=505.24s)]
*  No background in biology, but just a passion. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=506.8s)]
*  So if you could, let's bridge this into two parts. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=509.92s)]
*  Number one, what attributes do you have that enabled you to do this? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=513.0s)]
*  And number two, what was the tech that enabled this, you know, the direwolf to come back [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=519.88s)]
*  and will enable a multitude of other species? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=526.16s)]
*  We'll talk about those. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=528.76s)]
*  Everybody, I hope you're enjoying this episode. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=529.76s)]
*  You know, earlier this year, I was joined on stage at the 2025 Abundance Summit by a [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=532.36s)]
*  a rock star group of entrepreneurs, CEOs, investors focused on the vision and future [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=537.22s)]
*  for AGI, humanoid robotics, longevity, blockchain, basically the next trillion dollar opportunities. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=543.98s)]
*  If you weren't at the Abundance Summit, it's not too late. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=550.6s)]
*  You can watch the entire Abundance Summit online by going to exponentialmastery.com. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=553.1600000000001s)]
*  That's exponentialmastery.com. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=559.3000000000001s)]
*  So fundamentally, I think that there's two things that you're going to pursue a moonshotty, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=561.9s)]
*  you know, approach to a project. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=567.4599999999999s)]
*  There's two things that you have to remember. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=569.26s)]
*  One is entrepreneurship. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=571.1s)]
*  It's a team sport like it is. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=572.72s)]
*  It is a team sport. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=574.74s)]
*  You know, everyone's got to play their role. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=576.34s)]
*  Everyone's got to play it well. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=578.34s)]
*  A lot of times, you know, one or two people get the glory or the negativity. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=579.8199999999999s)]
*  But it is a team sport, right? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=587.22s)]
*  Like you mentioned, I don't have a background in biology, so I have to trust our science [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=588.5799999999999s)]
*  teams to be able to do what they do and I just have to empower them. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=593.06s)]
*  And then the second thing is I think you have to be a little more persistent than time. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=596.34s)]
*  And I think you have to think about things in just knowing that like, you know, whether [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=601.62s)]
*  you have a great day or a bad day, everyone talks about like the trough of disillusionment [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=607.22s)]
*  and all these things. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=613.1800000000001s)]
*  I think those things fundamentally don't matter. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=614.1800000000001s)]
*  I think that if you're doing a moonshot, you just have to be looking like I think about [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=616.86s)]
*  colossal 50 years from now. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=620.62s)]
*  I don't think about the dire wolf watch. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=622.38s)]
*  People were like, oh, my gosh, like just to go through a little bit of PTSD, because I [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=624.3399999999999s)]
*  think it's important. I don't think anybody knows this. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=629.06s)]
*  I've yet to say this, but let me let me and then we'll get into the science. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=630.8599999999999s)]
*  It's Salim asked. But I do think this is important. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=634.9399999999999s)]
*  Day one, we on Monday of last week, and I think you could make like a fun like 24 hour [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=637.5799999999999s)]
*  or like a five day story about this in just what happened last week. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=644.18s)]
*  So we were not supposed to launch until Tuesday. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=650.02s)]
*  We launched on Monday because we went to a couple of because the science is so detailed. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=653.78s)]
*  And if you just look at a press release without like the scientific papers, without all the [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=659.22s)]
*  data, without sitting down with the scientists, you could just say, oh, it's not a dire wolf. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=664.4599999999999s)]
*  Right. Like they like like I could easily have people get to that conclusion very easily. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=669.74s)]
*  But I think that what we did, which I thought was smart, was we went and spent hundreds [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=674.18s)]
*  of hours with Time magazine and with the New Yorker and with Rolling Stone and with a couple [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=679.3s)]
*  of key outlets and brought them completely unfold. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=684.9399999999999s)]
*  We actually moved the wolves to a secure location and let them see the wolf because we live [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=688.14s)]
*  in an AI generated world. Like who's not to say someone couldn't just generate something. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=692.9399999999999s)]
*  Right. Like not that we did it. We would ever do that. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=698.46s)]
*  But I mean, but that's that's the level that we put into that. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=700.62s)]
*  You know, we're certified by American Humane Society. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=703.26s)]
*  We flew the wolves on private jets. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=705.62s)]
*  We literally brought in American Humane Society. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=707.8199999999999s)]
*  We had I mean, we had 15 personnel with them at all times. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=710.5s)]
*  We waited till they got acclimated to this new location. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=714.54s)]
*  Just think of it. So we spent a lot of time and thought into this. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=717.6999999999999s)]
*  Right. Well, then we're supposed to launch on Tuesday. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=721.6999999999999s)]
*  And so on Monday, we had all these people that have covered us over the years. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=724.02s)]
*  We were going to give them the heads up. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=727.3399999999999s)]
*  We actually did have a scientific paper and we had nine handouts, nine handouts and an [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=728.8199999999999s)]
*  11 page press release. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=734.5799999999999s)]
*  So we had a lot of material. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=736.5s)]
*  We were going to give it to all these people under under embargo. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=737.94s)]
*  So they didn't feel left out, even though we went really deep with these other people. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=741.42s)]
*  And we said, we think this is a story that's going to persist. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=745.14s)]
*  So we did that Monday morning. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=747.58s)]
*  I'm getting in the shower. Kiss my my nine month old son. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=749.58s)]
*  Say, I'm going to go get ready for work. Kiss him goodbye. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=753.46s)]
*  About to get the shower. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=755.86s)]
*  Looked at my phone. It's the cover of the New Yorker. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=757.9s)]
*  New Yorker broke the embargo. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=760.62s)]
*  So that happened. And websites not live. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=762.14s)]
*  The hundreds of press people that we worked with for years, for years, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=766.54s)]
*  that have covered us pretty favorably when we didn't even have animals feel betrayed. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=770.82s)]
*  People are like, you know, Time magazine's calling me like we're on the cover of time. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=777.98s)]
*  Like, what did you do? Did you do this? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=783.26s)]
*  It's saying, wow. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=786.78s)]
*  So I'm on my I'm in my car speeding to one of our labs as fast as possible. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=788.22s)]
*  And it's like websites going live. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=793.18s)]
*  People on Twitter are like, there's Laura Mipsum on the website. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=795.22s)]
*  And we're like, no shit. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=798.5400000000001s)]
*  It's a website. What about to be live? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=799.78s)]
*  It's like we had about two hours of content for YouTube that explains all the making up. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=802.1s)]
*  We're going to roll out. We're just like, push everything live. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=806.78s)]
*  So so that was Monday. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=809.74s)]
*  And then all those stories that we talked about came out and they're all super positive. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=811.34s)]
*  But no one got to digest that the scientific paper didn't get submitted to bio archive. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=816.0600000000001s)]
*  There was just all this stuff. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=820.74s)]
*  So then Tuesday was wait. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=821.94s)]
*  Oh, by the way, Monday, we're going to talk to all our scientific advisors, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=824.5s)]
*  give them an update on the project because we're worried that it could leak because it was just so cool. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=827.14s)]
*  Our scientific advisors are cause being like, why didn't you tell us about that? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=831.42s)]
*  Like it was it was an insane ripple of best laid plans. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=834.2199999999999s)]
*  No, no, it didn't. Wait, wait, let me just give you I know I got I know it's limited time, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=838.7399999999999s)]
*  but you have to know how crazy. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=842.02s)]
*  Yeah. Then on the embargo, that's really, really, really. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=844.0999999999999s)]
*  It gets way worse. It gets way worse. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=847.9799999999999s)]
*  Then so I called up Revive and Restore, who's an incredible nonprofit. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=850.26s)]
*  I love Ryan and I love Stewart. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=855.98s)]
*  They actually, to your point, Peter, have been talking about the extinction for a long time. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=857.74s)]
*  They're nonprofit. Right. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=861.82s)]
*  It's like this takes hundreds of millions of dollars in systems theory [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=862.74s)]
*  modeling to actually achieve this. Right. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=866.46s)]
*  You can't just do it with a nonprofit. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=868.14s)]
*  And so I said, hey, just so you know, there's [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=869.66s)]
*  I was going to call you today to tell you about what's coming tomorrow. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=873.0600000000001s)]
*  But this just happened. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=876.86s)]
*  And I will tell you, we did meet with the Department of Interior [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=878.54s)]
*  and they're excited about classifying the extinction as a form of conservation. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=881.98s)]
*  And the feedback was overwhelming. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=886.66s)]
*  They're like, we've been trying to do this for 10 years. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=888.06s)]
*  Oh, my gosh, this is huge. That's Monday. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=889.54s)]
*  Well, then Tuesday, we get this academic backlash, which is, you know, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=891.66s)]
*  no one cares about two things, the science, which blew my mind. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=895.4599999999999s)]
*  And I mentioned I thought was a travesty. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=899.4599999999999s)]
*  And no one cared about the fact that while we made three direwolves, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=901.5s)]
*  yes, they're direwolves, there were four red wolves that we cloned. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=904.9s)]
*  Using a new noninvasive cloning technique, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=908.42s)]
*  which I'm sure we'll talk about with you, Salim, in a second. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=911.5s)]
*  But we developed a new technique to clone that's less invasive for animals. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=914.42s)]
*  We made four red wolves, which are the most critically endangered wolves [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=918.3s)]
*  on the planet. There's only 15 left in the wild. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=921.98s)]
*  Wow. No one covered that either. Right. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=924.46s)]
*  And then it became a philosophical and semantic debate on what makes a species. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=927.46s)]
*  But what's interesting is there's about 30. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=932.18s)]
*  I thought there's 11. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=934.38s)]
*  There's about 31 ways to classify species in all these different ways. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=935.18s)]
*  And so by many ways, a polar bear and a brown bear [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=938.9s)]
*  should not are considered the same species, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=944.4599999999999s)]
*  but they have a different species name and they look completely different [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=946.78s)]
*  phylogenetically. So there's all these different reasons or different ways to do [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=950.4599999999999s)]
*  this. And so that became the discussion. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=954.06s)]
*  So then we're like, like fighting fire and just kind of like not really trying to [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=956.5s)]
*  explain ourselves, but just saying, like educating people, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=960.5s)]
*  like not trying to persuade, but just educating, like actually a lot of ways to [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=963.5s)]
*  do all this. So that was Tuesday and then Wednesday. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=967.18s)]
*  And then, by the way, conservation community is super stoked about, you know, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=970.82s)]
*  at least new tools and conservation. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=974.3s)]
*  So I was like, OK, well, it's a win, whatever. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=975.62s)]
*  So then Wednesday, there's a cabinet meeting, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=977.42s)]
*  which obviously we're not a part of the president, like like the U.S. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=979.86s)]
*  cabinet, U.S. cabinet. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=983.38s)]
*  There's a cabinet meeting. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=984.86s)]
*  And, you know, we have yet to we've not talked back to the Department of Interior [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=986.26s)]
*  so we don't know the full context of the meeting, right, because we're not in the [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=989.18s)]
*  cabinet meetings, we're not part of the cabinet of the United States. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=991.66s)]
*  And a comment was made about de-extinction and and [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=994.02s)]
*  the Department of Interior and Secretary Burgum is very passionate. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=999.2199999999999s)]
*  He told us in the meeting with us that he's excited about getting animals off [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1003.1s)]
*  the endangered species list, but that's not removing them. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1007.02s)]
*  That's recovering them. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1010.3s)]
*  That means that we have enough of them that's that's healthy enough that they're [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1011.74s)]
*  no longer on the and he made a comment that we put things on endangered species [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1016.38s)]
*  list, but they never come off. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1019.5s)]
*  And so how do we get animals off using technology? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1020.82s)]
*  And so we thought it. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1023.62s)]
*  But once again, we live in a moderately polarizing climate right now. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1025.78s)]
*  And so that became [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1029.74s)]
*  and I don't know if they I can't speak for the administration, but that became [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1032.18s)]
*  de-extinction is now being used to get rid of endangered species. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1035.78s)]
*  Like, wait, what? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1039.74s)]
*  So that was my win. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1041.22s)]
*  So that was my Wednesday. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1042.66s)]
*  And then Thursday, I was like, we'll just answer whatever questions come up. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1044.8600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1049.54s)]
*  And so so last week was a little bit of a crazy thing. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1049.86s)]
*  But going back to your original question, you know, at the end of the day, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1053.3799999999999s)]
*  like that was one week in time and Colossal is looking at 50 years. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1057.8999999999999s)]
*  And our goal with Colossal is to bring back these species as well as [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1063.5s)]
*  use all those technologies to save existing species. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1068.1399999999999s)]
*  And so in that model, you have to think on a 50 year horizon. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1071.34s)]
*  So if you get great press on day one, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1077.02s)]
*  which we did, and you get crazy press on day two, that's OK. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1079.1s)]
*  Those are two days in a 50 year journey. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1082.98s)]
*  And I think you have to think like that. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1086.54s)]
*  So let's talk about [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1088.26s)]
*  I have so many questions, buddy, and I'm so proud of you. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1090.4599999999998s)]
*  And just for full disclosure, I'm a seed investor and advisor to Colossal [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1094.5s)]
*  Biosciences. I've I've met Ben and there's something about you as a CEO [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1099.98s)]
*  that have you've got the right [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1106.54s)]
*  phenotypic attributes that people just want to support you. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1109.1s)]
*  And what you've done, I mean, how old is Biosciences Colossal these days? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1112.3s)]
*  So we were founded in September 2021. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1115.8999999999999s)]
*  OK, so you're four years old and [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1119.26s)]
*  you you went from a zero dollar valuation at a first conversation with George [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1122.1399999999999s)]
*  Church to now you're say it, what's your valuation today? [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1128.8999999999999s)]
*  Our current valuation is ten point two billion. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1133.54s)]
*  Ten point two billion. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1135.78s)]
*  That's pretty insane in four in four years. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1136.94s)]
*  Yeah, I want to talk about the business model, but the science real quick, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1139.58s)]
*  you know, sort of Deextinction 101. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1146.02s)]
*  All right. So Deextinction 101. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1149.02s)]
*  Remember, I'm not a scientist, but you basically in so far. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1150.5s)]
*  Can I just pause for a second? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1154.62s)]
*  I think this is so important when people think about moonshots, etc. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1156.34s)]
*  You have no background in biology to be doing this. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1161.34s)]
*  Right. Just as Elon has no background in space or the car industry, the energy [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1164.54s)]
*  industry, it's people coming in with a beginner's mind and an MTP leveraging [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1168.6200000000001s)]
*  new technologies that are accelerating naturally. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1174.14s)]
*  And that formula gives you any possibility in the world. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1176.7s)]
*  And I think that's such a huge thing that we should drill down on. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1179.78s)]
*  Anyway, the science is so great. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1183.5s)]
*  I'm really curious and I feel like I like to ask questions and [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1187.1000000000001s)]
*  you know, and George will sometimes say that I'm the best student he's never had [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1193.3400000000001s)]
*  because I just I like to ask weird questions. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1197.6200000000001s)]
*  And he's like, I didn't think of it like that. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1200.8600000000001s)]
*  And those aren't like scientific breakthroughs. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1202.98s)]
*  They're just I just I to your point, I don't know anything about it. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1204.9s)]
*  So I can ask, you know, childlike questions about it. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1208.1000000000001s)]
*  And then I get these answers and it's great. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1211.54s)]
*  OK, under the science. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1215.18s)]
*  OK, so the science in the one of the reasons why I've had to raise so much [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1216.74s)]
*  capital is you have to build the entire system. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1220.5s)]
*  Right. So just like going to space or even just building a software system, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1222.46s)]
*  the whole system has to work and just design the software. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1225.9s)]
*  You got to build the software, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1228.18s)]
*  you got to build the hosting, you got to build all the API calls. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1229.02s)]
*  So you have to think about it. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1231.46s)]
*  So I think like my background is mostly in software. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1233.06s)]
*  So I try to think about things like how you build software. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1235.74s)]
*  And so you first have to get ancient DNA. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1239.38s)]
*  Right. And so there's kind of three fundamental parts. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1242.66s)]
*  Right. There's ancient DNA. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1245.54s)]
*  There's the closest living relatives. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1247.14s)]
*  And then there's the tools to make it possible. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1249.1000000000001s)]
*  So how old is the oldest ancient DNA? [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1251.5800000000002s)]
*  Because, I mean, I'm going to ask you because everybody asks you. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1254.94s)]
*  It's your number one question. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1257.8200000000002s)]
*  Can you bring back dinosaurs? [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1258.94s)]
*  Is there any dinosaur DNA out there? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1260.26s)]
*  There is no dinosaur DNA. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1262.38s)]
*  George and I both agree philosophically that you should not ever say things are [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1264.38s)]
*  impossible because maybe we don't fully understand it yet. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1269.5800000000002s)]
*  I think we're learning things every day, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1272.22s)]
*  which is also not a very academic mindset. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1274.5800000000002s)]
*  I might have you most academics that we know everything. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1276.5s)]
*  So I deal with that quite a bit, but I think I know nothing. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1279.7s)]
*  So I'm on the other side of the spectrum. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1282.62s)]
*  But right now you can go back a little over a million years. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1284.98s)]
*  Our oldest we have about 59 mammoth genomes we're working with. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1289.18s)]
*  And our oldest is a step mammoth, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1292.7s)]
*  which I would argue is still a mammoth, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1296.14s)]
*  but a step mammoth is currently classified and it's one point two million years old. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1297.62s)]
*  Awesome. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1303.42s)]
*  But most of the DNA we work with is [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1304.46s)]
*  depending on the project's hundreds to thousands of years old. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1307.8600000000001s)]
*  That kind of range. We're still on time. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1311.6200000000001s)]
*  It degrades DNA, degrades very rapidly. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1313.5800000000002s)]
*  Very, very rapidly. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1316.26s)]
*  The minute you get blood out of a system, it starts to degrade. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1317.5800000000002s)]
*  And so so what we do is we first have to get fine ancient DNA. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1321.5800000000002s)]
*  And you've got it. A lot of times there's this thing called coverage. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1326.9s)]
*  Because these these big DNA reading machines, they aren't like a hundred. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1329.66s)]
*  They've gotten incredible, but they're not 100 percent accurate. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1336.54s)]
*  So the more coverage you can get, meaning the more times the full genome that you [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1339.02s)]
*  can read, the higher likelihood that they know it, you know, at 3081, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1343.18s)]
*  that that's a C, right, versus a G. Right. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1349.26s)]
*  And so it's giving it almost like a probabilistic score for each letter at [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1351.98s)]
*  each at each space and at each position. Right. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1356.74s)]
*  Yeah, the position. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1359.58s)]
*  So so the more coverage you can get, so if you only have like one X, meaning that [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1360.74s)]
*  there is you do this is a destructive sampling process, meaning you put it in. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1364.74s)]
*  It's like, you know, it's like it's like when that old claw game, you put it in. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1369.5800000000002s)]
*  And if you don't get the teddy bear, you still lost your money. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1373.38s)]
*  Right. And so you put the DNA in into the you do this library prep, but it destroys [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1376.46s)]
*  the library in the in the sequencing process. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1381.38s)]
*  Right. So so therefore you've got to get enough DNA. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1383.8200000000002s)]
*  And the problem with ancient DNA is to your point, Peter, it degrades very quickly. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1387.42s)]
*  Cold, dry places are the best places we get DNA, but it degrades very quickly [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1392.54s)]
*  because of heat, acidification. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1396.78s)]
*  That's why I love brand tarpritz is terrible for this. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1399.02s)]
*  And also you have animals that die on top of the animals. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1402.4599999999998s)]
*  You have animals that eat animals, defecate on animals. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1405.58s)]
*  You got bacteria. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1407.9399999999998s)]
*  So you have to then screen it and make sure you understand what's truly endowed. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1409.3799999999999s)]
*  What is actually that animal? [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1412.9399999999998s)]
*  Right. And so and that's literally kind of a numbers game. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1414.9399999999998s)]
*  Right. So sometimes you get zero DNA on species. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1418.4199999999998s)]
*  Sometimes you get a lot of endogenous DNA. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1421.78s)]
*  So the mosquitoes trapped in amber just isn't the thing. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1424.1399999999999s)]
*  It's just so not that we've tried, but [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1427.86s)]
*  amber is not a great storage vehicle. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1431.22s)]
*  It's very porous. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1434.3799999999999s)]
*  It's not a great storage vehicle for DNA. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1435.42s)]
*  So there is no DNA for that. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1437.5s)]
*  And I don't think that we'll get back to I don't want to ever say impossible [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1439.8999999999999s)]
*  because who knows, but but I know people still think Loch Ness Monster is there. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1443.22s)]
*  So if some crazy lineage of dinosaur magically existed somewhere and died [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1448.7s)]
*  during the ice age, that would be great. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1452.66s)]
*  But I don't know that that I don't think that most likely did not happen. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1454.5s)]
*  So so you can go back about a million years. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1458.3000000000002s)]
*  So then you get these pieces of DNA, you do the sequencing and we got about a 13x. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1460.74s)]
*  So we had a full read of the genome 13 different times. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1466.14s)]
*  And for you can do what we do probably at five to six X. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1469.7s)]
*  But you really if you get north of 10 or especially north of 20, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1475.6200000000001s)]
*  then for what we do, which is called functional, the extinction, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1479.54s)]
*  because we're not trying to clone these extinct species, there's no living cells. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1482.38s)]
*  You can't clone from a dead cell from from from bone. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1485.66s)]
*  You can't clone from a dead bone. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1488.94s)]
*  We're trying to identify and read the genome and then use synthetic biology [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1492.18s)]
*  to engineer in those lost genes to time. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1496.5s)]
*  And so once you read it, you compare it to the closest living relative, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1500.94s)]
*  because why would you know it's like if you're going to make a dire wolf, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1504.14s)]
*  you shouldn't start with a frog because hundreds of millions of you. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1507.18s)]
*  That's a lot of changes. Right. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1510.3000000000002s)]
*  And so dire wolves, for example, are ninety nine point five percent the same as [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1511.74s)]
*  as gray wolves. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1516.7s)]
*  And in many people didn't know this until we just submitted this paper, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1518.7800000000002s)]
*  which is currently the number one paper on bio archives. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1522.66s)]
*  We actually crashed bio archives on two other weird things. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1525.26s)]
*  We crashed bio archives on Friday, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1528.94s)]
*  on Thursday when we uploaded bio archives went down. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1532.22s)]
*  It was the number one research paper. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1535.3799999999999s)]
*  I think it still is right now. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1537.7s)]
*  And it's on a preprint server. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1539.3s)]
*  Oh, and also read it, read it, shut it down, shut down colossal for a week. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1540.94s)]
*  They said they literally put out a statement. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1544.74s)]
*  I don't know if this is happening before. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1546.34s)]
*  There was a statement last night that said any mention of colossal colossal [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1547.86s)]
*  biosciences, dire wolves, any names will be banned for one week. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1551.94s)]
*  It's the craziest thing I've ever seen. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1557.4199999999998s)]
*  So anyway, back to the science. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1559.62s)]
*  So so once you once you have [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1561.1s)]
*  and there's no like GCP of species, which I think there needs to be, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1563.7s)]
*  we're actually advocating the federal government to do this. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1567.14s)]
*  There's no like bio bank or bio vault like the equivalent of the seed vault that has [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1569.38s)]
*  all these cells for wolves that are immortalized or ployed in stem cells. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1574.14s)]
*  No one's done genome sequencing on all of this. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1578.42s)]
*  No one's done any of that. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1580.6200000000001s)]
*  So then we have to go do all that. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1581.74s)]
*  And then you compare the two. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1583.34s)]
*  And then once you identify those genes, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1584.94s)]
*  we look for areas in coding regions and in regulatory regions in the areas that we [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1587.1000000000001s)]
*  know will drive or we at least believe will drive certain types of phenotypes. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1592.18s)]
*  And then we engineer them into the genetic donor. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1598.06s)]
*  In this case, it's the closest living relative being the gray wolf. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1601.6200000000001s)]
*  And then we identify those. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1605.02s)]
*  We edit those into the gray wolf. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1606.46s)]
*  And then we do a process called somatic cell nuclear transfer, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1608.6200000000001s)]
*  which is basically cloning, which they which Dolly made famous. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1611.26s)]
*  Only we now use like robotics and lasers and all kinds of stuff to make it much [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1614.74s)]
*  more efficient. You put it into a host and if everything goes well, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1618.26s)]
*  you get a healthy animal. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1621.6999999999998s)]
*  Then what percentage of your team and your tech do you consider [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1623.1399999999999s)]
*  software versus biology? [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1627.8999999999999s)]
*  How much is this is a is a biology company? [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1631.3s)]
*  I'd say I'd say it's half and half. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1634.22s)]
*  And so we spend a lot like the sequencing, like, like, you know, one of the once again, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1636.4199999999998s)]
*  this goes back to education. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1642.26s)]
*  People some people were critical or they're like, but they didn't use tiny [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1643.86s)]
*  tweezers to move the DNA. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1647.98s)]
*  But they don't understand synthetic biology. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1650.7s)]
*  And so it's like it's like so this is this is awesome. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1652.22s)]
*  I like people were like, were you frustrated? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1655.06s)]
*  I got an interview over the weekend. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1656.5s)]
*  Like, were you frustrated by that comment? [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1657.62s)]
*  I was like, no, this is an educational opportunity. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1659.1s)]
*  Right. No, like, this is cool. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1661.46s)]
*  Like you think that you move the DNA from here over here. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1662.98s)]
*  That's not how it works. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1665.82s)]
*  We just read it. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1666.9s)]
*  You said this before, Peter. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1668.22s)]
*  It's just a different coding language. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1669.58s)]
*  And so we read the code and then we rewrite the code [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1671.4199999999998s)]
*  and we either change this code or we synthesize a block of code and stick it in. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1676.58s)]
*  We don't we don't move it with tiny tweezers. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1681.5s)]
*  How much of this is done by using CRISPR? [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1684.1399999999999s)]
*  You know, CRISPR has become the catch all for genome engineering. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1687.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1691.1399999999999s)]
*  It's a combination. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1692.1799999999998s)]
*  So one of the things that we've done really well is there's knockouts. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1693.3s)]
*  There's knock ins. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1697.4199999999998s)]
*  We can knock stuff out of the genome. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1698.1399999999999s)]
*  You can knock stuff in the genome. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1699.5s)]
*  You can change individual letters. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1700.8600000000001s)]
*  We do a lot of changing individual letters. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1702.8600000000001s)]
*  And some people trivialize that, which I think is insane. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1705.22s)]
*  I'll give you an example. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1709.38s)]
*  This is a conservation example. That's amazing. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1711.18s)]
*  And this goes directly to your question. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1713.66s)]
*  So in one of our tools of just being able to change the individual letters, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1716.14s)]
*  you write not doing a full knockout, but changing this from like a C to a G. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1720.02s)]
*  We have a project where in Australia, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1723.9s)]
*  they've actually introduced cane toads from South America. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1727.6200000000001s)]
*  What's killing all of the marsupials, specifically the northern quoll, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1730.74s)]
*  they're critically endangered now because they're eating this cane toad that they [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1734.14s)]
*  did not evolve next to and the neurotoxin kills. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1737.42s)]
*  Well, guess what we found out when we [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1740.46s)]
*  studied snakes, obviously not mammals, and other small mammals that eat cane toads [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1742.3s)]
*  in South America, that they have a similar change at one nucleotide. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1747.46s)]
*  So think of that three, three, you know, three point five billion base pairs. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1751.82s)]
*  One letter, one change confers a five [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1755.46s)]
*  thousand time resistance to cane toad toxin. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1759.62s)]
*  So we've now made dunnarts, which are the close livid relative before we wanted to [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1763.22s)]
*  work in the endangered species, we want to work in a little model species. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1767.74s)]
*  We've made dunnarts, which are another carnivorous marsupial that are now five [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1770.54s)]
*  thousand times more resistance to cane toad toxins with one letter change. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1775.06s)]
*  And so when people say, but that, you know, making one letter change is an [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1779.78s)]
*  idea, I was like, one letter change could change the entire animal. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1783.6999999999998s)]
*  You could literally like George Badao's [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1786.98s)]
*  statement says you could make an entire new species with one letter change. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1788.26s)]
*  That's extraordinary. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1791.98s)]
*  Wow. And so to answer and then we also do DNA synthesis. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1793.78s)]
*  So if there's a lot of changes all at the same time, sometimes we'll synthesize that [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1797.34s)]
*  block and just put that whole block in because it creates a lower probability of [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1802.26s)]
*  off target effects, because you'll you'll potentially only have off targets at the [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1807.26s)]
*  ends versus like making 20 changes in a gene. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1810.7s)]
*  So and where we are, what Colossal is probably, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1813.9s)]
*  I would argue, where the best stat is multiplexing, meaning that we take all [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1817.38s)]
*  those technologies, put it all in one big array and kind of one big guide and [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1821.18s)]
*  deliver it and kind of and we're pretty good at that. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1826.38s)]
*  How much easier is the next species to de-extinct? [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1831.5s)]
*  Because when I look at what you're doing, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1835.58s)]
*  it's if I use the computing architectures and analogy, you've got hardware, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1837.82s)]
*  you've got BIOS, you've got operating system applications. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1842.7s)]
*  Right. And you're essentially reinventing [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1846.5400000000002s)]
*  that entire stack to in different ways to do to cobble together what you're trying [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1848.46s)]
*  to do. It's not like you're writing one little application that runs on a very [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1853.1000000000001s)]
*  standardized, well understood stack. You reinventing the whole stack completely. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1856.66s)]
*  Now that you've done it once, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1862.18s)]
*  does the next time become exponentially easier and then much easier after that? [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1863.74s)]
*  I think that the editing becomes exponentially easier and the delivery [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1867.94s)]
*  becomes exponentially easier. We're working on some things with [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1872.22s)]
*  on the embryology side around like, how do you have a we're not there yet. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1876.46s)]
*  Just be clear, we've not done this. I don't want to claim we've done this. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1881.7800000000002s)]
*  We are working on some pretty interesting [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1884.3000000000002s)]
*  ideas around a universal donor egg where you can have matched mitochondria. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1885.9s)]
*  Because you can't go too insanely different. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1892.26s)]
*  I can't use like a cow egg, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1895.22s)]
*  which is a different size to grow an elephant, even if the size work the same, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1897.5400000000002s)]
*  because you'll have you have the potential, let's say, for mitochondria rejection. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1901.5400000000002s)]
*  But if you can make a universal egg and you can match the mitochondria, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1906.5400000000002s)]
*  then you have a universal egg that can work for any species. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1911.22s)]
*  It's pretty interesting. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1913.8200000000002s)]
*  And then you don't have to do the process of stem cell gametogenesis. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1914.7800000000002s)]
*  So sometimes people like you guys haven't thought about embryology. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1919.0600000000002s)]
*  That's all we think about. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1922.1000000000001s)]
*  And and so to your question, you know, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1924.14s)]
*  I think the editing, the comp bios scaling quite well, right, software and compute, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1928.3799999999999s)]
*  the models that we're retraining on what works gives us a better idea of what [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1934.4599999999998s)]
*  tools to use for what job, so that's scaling really well. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1938.86s)]
*  The the the multiplex ability in off target in the monoclonal screening. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1941.78s)]
*  So then screening all the cells, we do a lot of sequencing. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1946.5s)]
*  We even do all of the reason why we know [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1948.98s)]
*  that our animals are healthy before we put them in is we screen the embryos. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1950.86s)]
*  We do full genotype sequencing. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1954.4199999999998s)]
*  You have to, which is insane. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1956.54s)]
*  It's a lot of money and time that we do all of that. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1958.94s)]
*  So this sequence is scaling. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1961.74s)]
*  We're getting better at the library preparation DNA. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1964.46s)]
*  You know, I think that the big thing is [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1966.86s)]
*  I think that we will get to the point that we will be able to synthesize [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1970.22s)]
*  eventually full chromosomes and I think we'll get to the side, get to the point [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1974.22s)]
*  that we I think is a ways away, but I think we'll get there. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1977.46s)]
*  And then I think we'll be like we've already delivered in published literature, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1979.74s)]
*  35 KB or 30 KB I think is the biggest large cargo swap. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1985.42s)]
*  We've already done 100 KB is a kilobase, a thousand kilobase. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1990.78s)]
*  So it's a thousand letters. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1995.58s)]
*  So we're going to be. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1996.98s)]
*  You're good. Sorry. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1998.34s)]
*  So so so I think that that's all scaling. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=1999.58s)]
*  What what what the two areas that I think will scale over time is this goes back [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2002.42s)]
*  to your assault, your your stack analogy is like like the bios is similar. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2009.02s)]
*  Right. But we have to create different like we have to create like the editing [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2014.3799999999999s)]
*  and all the tools that you develop for the application layer. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2018.78s)]
*  I think it better and better and better. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2021.5s)]
*  The two things that we that we are seeing a lot of time on is that universal egg [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2023.26s)]
*  embryology side to make that easier. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2028.8999999999999s)]
*  So it doesn't have to be a custom chip architecture for every single species. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2031.02s)]
*  Right. The second thing is is in kind of on the bio side, I think it's interesting [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2034.86s)]
*  to think about or what we've been trying to think about is how do we make it where [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2040.18s)]
*  what are the universal truths across certain [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2047.74s)]
*  genes or gene families or pathways? [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2051.9s)]
*  Right. So like dogs scale really well. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2055.1400000000003s)]
*  So you have a Chihuahua and you have a Great Dane or you got a dire wolf. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2057.7400000000002s)]
*  Right. Dogs and wolves are dogs. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2061.2200000000003s)]
*  They they they scale really well. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2063.1800000000003s)]
*  Right. They scale one to one. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2065.5s)]
*  Not all species scale really well. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2067.06s)]
*  And so if you were to take like a goldfish and try to make it the size of [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2068.74s)]
*  a whale, it wouldn't scale like that. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2072.22s)]
*  So there's only a couple of clades of animals that scale like that. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2074.62s)]
*  And so how does that work? [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2078.2599999999998s)]
*  And, you know, how do we how does that work? [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2080.5s)]
*  Like with Al Corl and some of these gene [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2083.2599999999998s)]
*  families and how is that then replicatable across mammals? [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2085.22s)]
*  And then separately, what are those functional equivalents in birds? [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2089.02s)]
*  So those are the things that we're trying to that don't scale as well as the media. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2092.58s)]
*  So all these cells kind of like a little bit different media, which media is a [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2096.7799999999997s)]
*  growth, the growth medium in which these cells are getting nutrients and growing. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2101.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. So, Ben, one of the things about taking [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2105.5s)]
*  on a moonshot like this is along the way towards this massive vision. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2108.3399999999997s)]
*  You're solving all these other problems that can easily become spin out companies. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2113.74s)]
*  And and you've been doing that. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2118.5s)]
*  You spun out form bio, which is which is fantastic. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2121.54s)]
*  And one of the spin outs I can't wait for [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2125.7s)]
*  you to talk about is the idea of artificial wombs. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2128.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean, you just had a baby. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2131.74s)]
*  You didn't use an artificial womb. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2133.7s)]
*  You used your your your wife, which was great. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2135.34s)]
*  We have surrogates we can go to. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2138.94s)]
*  But this idea of an artificial womb we've seen in science fiction for a while. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2141.38s)]
*  How far off are we from full gestation artificial wombs? [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2146.82s)]
*  It's a great question. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2150.98s)]
*  So we have a 17 person team on it. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2152.3s)]
*  Our goal with artificial wombs, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2154.8999999999996s)]
*  because colossal to your point, doesn't work on anything human. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2156.7s)]
*  Anytime that we have a technology that has an application to human, we patented [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2159.3399999999997s)]
*  we've had a lot of technologies. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2163.7799999999997s)]
*  We actually patents and stuff recently around [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2165.8999999999996s)]
*  around P53 and cancer and whatnot. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2169.18s)]
*  And so, which, by the way, P53, one of the reasons that whales live so long [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2173.58s)]
*  is they've got extra copies of this P53 gene. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2178.66s)]
*  Yep. And so do elephants and elephants. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2182.46s)]
*  You know, we read we I guess we all read the same thing with whales, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2185.7400000000002s)]
*  but it's easier to sell the elephants because they still go underwater. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2188.78s)]
*  The [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2193.1400000000003s)]
*  and so I think there's a lot of cool tech that can come from that. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2194.7000000000003s)]
*  But on the artificial womb side, you know, we spin everything out. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2199.54s)]
*  So we won't ever make an artificial [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2202.78s)]
*  womb for humans, but I think that someone could potentially use our technology to do that. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2204.1400000000003s)]
*  I will say it's harder to grow an elephant, not ethically regulatory or [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2208.8599999999997s)]
*  philosophically or religiously. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2215.5s)]
*  It is harder biologically to grow some of the species we're working on and a human. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2217.3799999999997s)]
*  And I think that if we continue on the [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2222.58s)]
*  current course and speed by the end of twenty twenty six, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2225.62s)]
*  we will have the world's first mammal birth fully ex utero, where we went from. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2229.3399999999997s)]
*  You know, it'd be a wow, be an elephant, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2234.5s)]
*  it'd be small and then we'll scale from there. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2236.58s)]
*  But our vision for that once again goes back to conservation because imagine a [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2238.3s)]
*  world where you can grow everyone knows about the northern white rhino, which were [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2242.7000000000003s)]
*  the genetic rescue partner on, but imagine a world where you could grow [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2246.78s)]
*  200 genetically diverse northern white rhinos in a lab. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2251.82s)]
*  And then, you know, [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2255.58s)]
*  in without ever having to interfere with another animal or a rhino. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2257.46s)]
*  And then that goes into those baby rhinos, then [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2262.54s)]
*  those work with rewilding partners with them back into the field. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2269.06s)]
*  So I think artificial wombs, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2272.7000000000003s)]
*  if you can do multiple different placental types, will change conservation. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2275.34s)]
*  And I think we could productionize endangered species development. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2279.98s)]
*  And we can I think we I think we could save every species on the planet. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2283.34s)]
*  Well, let's let's pause on that moment, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2287.26s)]
*  save every species on the planet. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2289.58s)]
*  That's that's pretty extraordinary. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2291.3s)]
*  When you said 2026, that's like next year. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2293.54s)]
*  No, I know. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2296.5s)]
*  It's right there. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2297.98s)]
*  OK, yeah. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2299.1s)]
*  OK, I want to give you an umbrella comment and then you tell me how close we are to [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2300.34s)]
*  this. OK, one of the holy grails of synthetic biology when we used to talk [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2304.94s)]
*  about this was that if you if you get to that holy grail, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2309.5s)]
*  you essentially are looking at DNA as a Microsoft Word document, which we can edit. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2313.58s)]
*  And every one of our cells is governed by the DNA that tells it to be a liver cell [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2319.2999999999997s)]
*  or heart cell and how to operate, etc. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2323.3399999999997s)]
*  If you get to that point, the human being of 50 trillion cells or whatever is [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2325.46s)]
*  essentially a software engineering problem. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2329.8999999999996s)]
*  How close are we to that to that point [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2332.66s)]
*  where you can edit it as easily as you can edit a product? [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2335.2999999999997s)]
*  It is a focus and funding problem. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2338.18s)]
*  It's not a lack of knowledge problem. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2340.8999999999996s)]
*  And so like everyone's spending all this time on large language models, which is [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2342.66s)]
*  great if the same effort goes into that into this solving specifically this. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2346.5s)]
*  I think it's five years. If it doesn't, I think it's 10. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2352.42s)]
*  Costo. And by the way, AI is going to be the biggest accelerant to all of this. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2355.98s)]
*  Yeah, AI access to compute and then eventually quantum. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2360.9s)]
*  Those combined with with synthetic biology. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2365.42s)]
*  George has visions of that are crazy about synthetic. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2369.74s)]
*  We've talked about like. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2372.42s)]
*  So to find synthetic biology and let's talk about crazy. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2373.8199999999997s)]
*  Let's go crazy. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2377.66s)]
*  So the way there's lots of definitions for these things. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2379.22s)]
*  We look at synthetic biology as a way that we can use data and AI and other tools [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2383.14s)]
*  to basically change life, engineer life or direct life in a specific way. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2389.02s)]
*  So that's things like making drought resistant plants, making drought resistant [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2395.3799999999997s)]
*  animals. There's a terrible process that people that that animals go through for [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2400.42s)]
*  dehorning them because the cows are now like everyone loves to think about cows [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2405.1800000000003s)]
*  in these beautiful fields like they stand Yellowstone, but they're really not for [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2408.9s)]
*  the most part. And so they dehorn them because a lot of times they'll they're so [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2412.1400000000003s)]
*  close together, they'll stab each other and they'll get infections that causes [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2415.86s)]
*  disease and hurt. So they physically dehorn them. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2419.02s)]
*  You can actually now we could engineer them to just be hornless cows. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2422.06s)]
*  Right. So then, you know, I'm not encouraging me to eating meat. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2425.02s)]
*  I'm just telling you that is something that exists today. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2428.82s)]
*  And so synthetic biology affords us all these opportunities. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2431.54s)]
*  Right. We've got a company called Breaking that we started, which is about using a [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2434.02s)]
*  synth, using synthetic biology to supercharge this microbe that literally [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2438.2200000000003s)]
*  breaks the chemical bonds and plastics. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2442.46s)]
*  It doesn't make microplastic doesn't eat plastic. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2444.26s)]
*  It breaks. So I call it breaking. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2446.38s)]
*  It breaks the chemical bonds and plastics. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2448.3s)]
*  Right. And so it just makes biomass as an output. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2450.38s)]
*  And so, you know, I think that we will eventually get to the CAD software of [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2453.1000000000004s)]
*  biology. You know, you know, to some point is like I think that we will be able to [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2457.78s)]
*  cure most disease states. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2464.1800000000003s)]
*  I think that we will be able to do epigenetic cell resetting. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2466.6600000000003s)]
*  I think we'll be able to live youthful lives for as long as we want outside of [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2470.86s)]
*  natural causes or outside of like, you know, acts of God and crazy things happens to. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2475.02s)]
*  I think that we will. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2480.1400000000003s)]
*  George and I talk about living one with nature. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2481.5s)]
*  And we have this vision because George and I both believe that we're going to [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2484.82s)]
*  live hundreds of years. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2487.46s)]
*  And so we think that there's and so one of the things that we think that's pretty [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2489.2200000000003s)]
*  interesting is if we can grow like instead of like a tree grows and you chop it down, [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2493.86s)]
*  right, and you make a house, why don't we make trees that like, [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2502.34s)]
*  like, why don't we make trees that like this is literally George and I is like crazy. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2506.14s)]
*  Like, you know, people are going to think, oh, these guys do like mushrooms. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2509.62s)]
*  But we have this idea of like, what if we [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2512.9s)]
*  could engineer trees to grow faster and grow in the shape of a house? [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2515.06s)]
*  And like, what if you could use trees as water filtration? [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2519.06s)]
*  What if you could have bioluminescent fungi in there? [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2522.94s)]
*  And like, what if you could literally [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2525.42s)]
*  build it, engineer and tell a tree to to grow in the form of a house? [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2527.7400000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2534.06s)]
*  And I don't that sounds psychotic, but I don't think that's in the next five years. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2534.98s)]
*  But I don't I think that's in the next hundred. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2540.3s)]
*  Like, I don't think it's that I think it's closer than people think. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2542.74s)]
*  We are we as humans and all animals are effectively molecular robots, right? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2548.46s)]
*  Yeah, we're designed on a molecular basis and we function in different ways. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2556.02s)]
*  And one could imagine putting ethics and morals aside that and I use this always [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2562.1s)]
*  an example at Singularity University for synthetic biology. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2567.22s)]
*  I said, I'm going to engineer [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2570.02s)]
*  a something that looks like a cat, except it walks around your carpet and it eats [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2572.26s)]
*  lint and it pees stain remover and that's its purpose. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2577.42s)]
*  And it just goes around and cleans the house. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2581.34s)]
*  Yeah. And but you can imagine you can imagine that. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2583.62s)]
*  I'm not going to get into the alien [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2586.98s)]
*  conversation, but if I were a future civilization, I would engineer the sort [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2588.34s)]
*  of aliens to, you know, to pilot the spaceships and [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2593.5s)]
*  and instead of robotic robotic systems, you want systems that are self-healing. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2598.3s)]
*  Yeah, it's about 13 years ago. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2603.62s)]
*  I had my two kids, my two boys. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2605.78s)]
*  And I remember at that moment in time, I made a decision to double down on my health. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2608.02s)]
*  Without question, I wanted to see their kids, their grandkids. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2613.62s)]
*  And really, you know, during this extraordinary time where the space [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2618.26s)]
*  frontier and A.I. and crypto is all exploding, it was like the most exciting [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2621.9s)]
*  time ever to be alive, and I made a decision to double down on my health. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2626.1400000000003s)]
*  And I've done that in three key areas. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2631.06s)]
*  The first is going every year for a found upload. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2634.1400000000003s)]
*  You know, found is one of the most advanced diagnostics and therapeutics [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2638.42s)]
*  companies. I go there, upload myself, digitize myself about 200 gigabytes of data [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2641.9s)]
*  that the A.I. system is able to look at to catch disease at inception. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2647.7799999999997s)]
*  You know, look for any cardiovascular, any cancer, [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2652.7799999999997s)]
*  neurodegenerative disease, any metabolic disease. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2655.62s)]
*  These things are all going on all the time and you can prevent them if you can find [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2658.9s)]
*  them at inception. So super important. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2663.98s)]
*  So found is one of my keys. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2666.18s)]
*  I make it available to the CEOs of all my companies, my family members, [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2667.74s)]
*  because health is a new wealth. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2672.06s)]
*  But beyond that, we are a collection of 40 [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2674.98s)]
*  trillion human cells and about another 100 trillion bacterial cells, fungi, [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2677.98s)]
*  viri, and we don't understand how that impacts us. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2683.86s)]
*  And so I use a company and a product called Viome and Viome has a technology called [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2688.42s)]
*  Metatranscriptomics, who was actually developed [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2695.42s)]
*  in New Mexico, the same place where the nuclear bomb was developed as a biodefense [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2699.1400000000003s)]
*  weapon, and their technology is able to help you understand [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2704.38s)]
*  what's going on in your body to understand which bacteria are producing, [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2709.1000000000004s)]
*  which proteins, and as a consequence of that, what foods are your superfoods that [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2713.7000000000003s)]
*  are best for you to eat or what food should you avoid? [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2718.98s)]
*  What's going on in your oral microbiome? [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2722.86s)]
*  So I use their testing to understand my [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2725.98s)]
*  foods, understand my medicines, understand my supplements. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2729.5s)]
*  And Viome really helps me understand from a biological and data standpoint, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2732.8999999999996s)]
*  what's best for me? And then finally, feeling good, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2738.02s)]
*  being intelligent, moving well is critical, but looking good. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2742.3399999999997s)]
*  When you look yourself in the mirror saying, [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2745.3399999999997s)]
*  I feel great about life is so important. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2747.8999999999996s)]
*  And so a product I use every day, [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2751.1s)]
*  twice a day is called OneSkin, developed by four incredible PhD women that found [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2753.9399999999996s)]
*  this 10 amino acid peptide that's able to zap senile cells in your skin [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2759.7799999999997s)]
*  and really help you stay youthful in your look and appearance. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2766.1s)]
*  So for me, these are three technologies I love and I use all the time. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2770.62s)]
*  I'll have my team linked to those in the show notes down below. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2775.9399999999996s)]
*  Please check them out. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2779.7799999999997s)]
*  Anyway, I hope you enjoyed that. Now back to the episode. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2781.18s)]
*  What are some of the crazy [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2784.22s)]
*  conversations you have with George when you're dreaming up without any limits? [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2786.2999999999997s)]
*  Let's hear some of that. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2791.02s)]
*  Well, I think the treehouse one is pretty crazy and weird. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2792.98s)]
*  Yeah. Another one that we've talked about [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2796.82s)]
*  that I think could be pretty interesting is how do we engineer in, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2800.2999999999997s)]
*  like you've seen these, you've probably heard about phages, right? [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2808.42s)]
*  And these like microbes that you can get in the dirt. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2811.62s)]
*  Like every time they like think a scoop of dirt, they find new bacteria and stuff [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2814.94s)]
*  that doesn't exist. Right. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2818.62s)]
*  So phages are viruses that infect bacteria versus viruses that infect humans. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2819.86s)]
*  And the numbers are I think there's like a billion quadrillion phages on the planet. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2828.14s)]
*  There are more phages on the planet than there are stars in the universe. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2834.82s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. It's the most insane. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2838.02s)]
*  Like every time you scoop a thing of dirt, [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2840.42s)]
*  they just like literally just go outside. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2842.98s)]
*  Just Google. Everyone can make a discovery. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2845.1s)]
*  Just Google. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2847.3399999999997s)]
*  The number of phages on Earth. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2848.14s)]
*  You'll throw it away. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2849.62s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2851.1s)]
*  But they've been using these like lattice architectures [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2852.06s)]
*  is to actually, and they've shown that, you know, in a typical scuba tube, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2855.54s)]
*  and this isn't with like synthetic biology, not even taint, [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2861.62s)]
*  it's like biology with just a scuba tank, they can like three or four x [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2864.46s)]
*  the volume of oxygen that it can hold using this kind of like structure from [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2869.2999999999997s)]
*  some of these pages, and I think it's really interesting. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2875.58s)]
*  And so I think so some of the stuff that we've like George, [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2878.2999999999997s)]
*  I've also talked about is, you know, how do we build self-healing outside [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2882.8199999999997s)]
*  of outside of humans and outside of outside of houses? [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2888.66s)]
*  But how do we build underwater cities that are also self-healing? [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2892.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2896.5s)]
*  And so that's probably our biggest and craziest dream is like, how do we, [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2896.86s)]
*  you know, if you look at the world's, you know, what's interesting about space [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2901.02s)]
*  is it makes you think about closed systems. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2905.5s)]
*  What's interesting about underwater is that it makes you think about closed [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2907.42s)]
*  systems, but you don't have a more of a stable temperature. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2910.86s)]
*  You don't have this like, you know, negative 500 to 500 degree [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2915.2200000000003s)]
*  fire 500 or 250 to 250, 500 degree variant in the sun. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2919.78s)]
*  That's instantaneous. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2924.5s)]
*  You don't have the vacuum. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2926.02s)]
*  You don't have the radiation. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2927.34s)]
*  It's also the cost per kilogram of sinking. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2928.62s)]
*  Something is much cheaper than putting it up in space. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2930.58s)]
*  And so so we've talked a lot. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2933.62s)]
*  One of the more weird ideas out there was we talked a lot about if you just look at [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2935.82s)]
*  the surface of the Earth, you know, we could do a lot of cool things and you'd [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2939.34s)]
*  have to it would force you to build, you know, very sustainably [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2943.62s)]
*  cities underwater. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2949.9s)]
*  And so that that that's a project that we're interested in. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2951.1800000000003s)]
*  That may be a 2090 project, but I think we'll get there. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2954.94s)]
*  All right. I got to ask you this question and [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2958.7400000000002s)]
*  I'm going to I'm going to force some version of an answer. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2961.46s)]
*  So a [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2964.6200000000003s)]
*  a royal or a, you know, a decade billionaire comes to you and says, Ben, [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2967.6200000000003s)]
*  I know you say it's impossible, but I want to I want to create a dinosaur. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2974.86s)]
*  How do you do it? [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2982.1400000000003s)]
*  I'm not saying you are doing it, not saying you plan to do it, [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2983.18s)]
*  but sort of theoretically. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2986.46s)]
*  Yeah. So so there is no dino DNA. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2990.94s)]
*  Right. And so [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2993.3s)]
*  just to kind of, you know, give a shout out to the haters. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=2995.5s)]
*  Jurassic Park is not a movie about dinosaurs, [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3001.86s)]
*  it's a movie about genetically modified birds with dinosaur and frog alleles. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3003.74s)]
*  Or it's a movie about dinosaurs, depending on how you want to classify our [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3008.58s)]
*  world. But so so [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3012.06s)]
*  there is no dino DNA. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3016.26s)]
*  If I were to if I were to try to go build a [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3017.86s)]
*  I don't I don't I don't think today you can I don't I don't think that you could [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3022.3s)]
*  bring back a dinosaur, I think using synthetic biology and probably not today, [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3027.54s)]
*  but probably 10 years from now, eight years from now, some period in time, [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3033.58s)]
*  you could do an ancestral state reconstruction of [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3038.02s)]
*  what we know of the tree [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3043.5s)]
*  and and I think that the phylogenetic tree and I think that you could do a giant [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3046.26s)]
*  sequencing project to and I think there's enough that is conserved across [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3050.82s)]
*  multiple clades of birds and reptiles that you would probably be able to go down [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3056.34s)]
*  to make like an archosaur, which is probably the very base of the trees. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3061.3s)]
*  Like the basil animal before it kind of stuff starts to get weird and split. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3065.34s)]
*  And yeah, I would I think that you could do that and then you would be engineering [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3071.26s)]
*  for phenotypes, right? [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3077.6600000000003s)]
*  So I think you'd be looking at looking to drive certain phenotypes. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3078.86s)]
*  And I think a lot of those, [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3083.46s)]
*  at least we understand computationally at this point what those protein [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3085.94s)]
*  coding regions are. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3092.42s)]
*  So I don't even know if it'd be less of a dinosaur than a dinosaur existed. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3093.86s)]
*  And so that's probably where I would start. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3098.9s)]
*  But I think it's a huge project. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3101.94s)]
*  I think it's a I think it's a lot of money. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3103.86s)]
*  I don't think it's a I don't think it's a hundred million dollar project. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3106.1800000000003s)]
*  I think it's quite a lot more. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3109.42s)]
*  Is there any possibility that we can [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3110.9s)]
*  harvest DNA of a dinosaur and find that it is preserved in some place, some way, [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3113.34s)]
*  somehow? The problem is DNA degradation and fossilization. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3118.38s)]
*  And you have to remember when the dinosaurs perished, it was due to extreme heat. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3121.82s)]
*  And so, [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3127.42s)]
*  you know, there is dinosaur DNA in the form of birds, right? [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3129.9s)]
*  Birds that exist in their dinosaurs. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3133.5s)]
*  And so but I do think that I don't think you'll ever get to the point that you will [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3136.6600000000003s)]
*  have dinosaur true dinosaur DNA. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3141.2200000000003s)]
*  There's people like Dr. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3145.94s)]
*  Kenneth Lacavara, who's arguably the number one paleontologist in the world, [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3147.5800000000004s)]
*  who's who discovered the four biggest dinosaurs, including Dreadnoughtus, [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3150.9s)]
*  which is the biggest dinosaur. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3154.14s)]
*  And he called me last week when we're when everyone was debating all this stuff. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3156.26s)]
*  We're not debating all this. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3161.6600000000003s)]
*  They're only debating the name. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3162.98s)]
*  And he and he said he had the same problem with Dreadnoughtus. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3165.1s)]
*  He said that he said that it was the biggest dinosaur and he did it based on [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3168.6600000000003s)]
*  kilograms and all this stuff. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3173.7400000000002s)]
*  And, you know, a lot of dinosaurs, they find like a bone and they're like, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3174.94s)]
*  it looked like this. But this one, it was a nearly you can Google. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3177.5s)]
*  And I don't know what percent, but it was like 40 or 60. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3180.94s)]
*  It's very, very complete for a large dinosaur. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3183.02s)]
*  And he found in Argentina a super cool story. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3185.54s)]
*  And he had people that called him and he said it was so annoying because they [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3189.2200000000003s)]
*  wanted to argue not like us versus metric system. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3194.5s)]
*  But they he what they wanted to come up with, they with a measure with a dinosaur [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3198.6200000000003s)]
*  mass unit. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3203.98s)]
*  And so he got into this big debate when it came. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3207.1800000000003s)]
*  One of the one of the biggest dinosaur [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3210.42s)]
*  discoveries ever, and it was in a large part of it was because he I think he said [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3212.54s)]
*  it was like 60 tons or something like that. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3217.3s)]
*  And they people wanted to debate a metric that everyone could agree on of dinosaur [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3219.78s)]
*  mass, which is just which is which is ludicrously absurd. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3226.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3230.7s)]
*  But Kenneth, one of the things he said [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3231.74s)]
*  that's pretty cool is he's demineralized dinosaur bones where he can we can get [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3233.62s)]
*  those amino acids and what his long term goal is, it'd be cool if you could pick [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3238.62s)]
*  up a dinosaur bone and this is his work, not ours. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3243.2599999999998s)]
*  We are not doing this. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3246.38s)]
*  I just want to make sure I give him full credit. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3247.46s)]
*  It'd be cool if you could pick up a dinosaur bone and be like, and you know, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3249.74s)]
*  you found it in, you know, Montana or North Dakota. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3254.38s)]
*  So you could say is it's a T-Rex bone, is this the Triceratops? [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3257.9s)]
*  And let's say that you didn't have like [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3261.34s)]
*  the gene, the the the dating of the geological formations around it. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3263.7000000000003s)]
*  You could demineralize a piece of the bone and based on the amino acids say, oh, [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3268.98s)]
*  this is a Triceratops bone, which is kind of cool. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3273.94s)]
*  So those are those are like, I mean, those are like, I mean, you can't [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3277.5s)]
*  you can't glean any data on how to build the animal out of that. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3282.26s)]
*  So, listen, I remember at the very beginning, we're talking about about your vision. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3285.98s)]
*  It started with the woolly mammoth. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3291.1400000000003s)]
*  It it sort of it sort of went off into [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3292.7s)]
*  thylacine and discussions about the dodo bird, about the dire wolf. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3296.7799999999997s)]
*  And so how many different species have you had conversations about bringing back [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3301.06s)]
*  rough order magnitude? [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3307.42s)]
*  Because you must be getting calls from all different parts of the world. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3308.86s)]
*  Twenty twenty five. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3311.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3312.82s)]
*  What's your roadmap here, pal? [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3313.7s)]
*  So we're working on the mammoth, [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3317.1s)]
*  we're going to test me and tiger, we're going to the dodo. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3318.58s)]
*  You know, given our most recent round of funding, we will most likely expand those [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3321.46s)]
*  into other avian and non avian species. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3326.94s)]
*  You know, we have not quite cracked the code on the primordial germ cells. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3332.42s)]
*  It's a little bit different in birds and males. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3337.1800000000003s)]
*  This goes back to that media question, right? [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3339.5800000000004s)]
*  It's like getting the media that PGC is what to grow in for birds is pretty hard. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3342.86s)]
*  And once we do that, once once we show we can do it for pigeon, [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3348.2999999999997s)]
*  which has never been done before, because dodo's for pigeons, [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3352.22s)]
*  just like dire wolves for wolves. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3355.1s)]
*  The once we do that, then we I'd probably feel confident in adding another avian [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3358.06s)]
*  species, but there's amazing species out there and there's some we can't do until [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3363.54s)]
*  we get further in the tech. Like my favorite animal is you should look this up. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3367.8199999999997s)]
*  It's the stellar sea cow. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3371.8199999999997s)]
*  It's the coolest damn animal ever. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3373.2599999999998s)]
*  So I don't know anyone in the world that doesn't like manatees like manatees. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3374.9s)]
*  Just awesome. Right. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3380.78s)]
*  They're harmless. They're cute. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3382.5s)]
*  They're vegetarians. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3384.7400000000002s)]
*  They're kind of tubby. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3386.2200000000003s)]
*  They move kind of slow. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3387.5s)]
*  They're you know, they do great stuff for the ecosystem. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3389.6200000000003s)]
*  Nobody there's not like Facebook hate groups for manatees. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3393.34s)]
*  Right. If they are, those people should go straight to jail. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3396.78s)]
*  And yeah. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3400.86s)]
*  Yeah, or apparently we do that too now. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3402.7799999999997s)]
*  And so the [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3406.74s)]
*  there was this thing called the stellar sea cow. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3409.2599999999998s)]
*  And I'm probably going to butcher the years. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3411.42s)]
*  So someone will yell at me online about it. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3412.8599999999997s)]
*  But it was like it went extinct like 60 years or 30 years after it was discovered. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3414.38s)]
*  And it was all upon the Pacific Northwest. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3420.1s)]
*  And apparently the kelp forests there were even thicker because it would eat [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3422.9s)]
*  and defecate and they are whale size like they're literally like bigger than whales. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3427.14s)]
*  Manatees. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3432.7s)]
*  And they were apparently really docile and they would just like swim up to people [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3433.8199999999997s)]
*  and they're curious, like I guess like dolphins, like dolphins are. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3437.8199999999997s)]
*  And people would just spear them and kill them. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3440.58s)]
*  And so [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3442.58s)]
*  curiosity is a bad evolutionary trait for [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3443.74s)]
*  large, slow moving megafauna for sure. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3446.5s)]
*  We've seen the rise of anthropolot. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3449.7799999999997s)]
*  We've seen like the rise of early human on continents and the decline of [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3452.2599999999998s)]
*  megafauna be inversely related, nearly one to one. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3458.18s)]
*  What's once humans move to a certain scale on a continent or subcontinent, [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3462.82s)]
*  the megafauna drops at a very predictable rate. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3468.5s)]
*  Yeah, we just like we're we're we're kind of like we go after big, you know, [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3473.46s)]
*  we all work together, tell a couple of big things. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3477.7000000000003s)]
*  A lot of times the big things have single births, long gestations. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3481.02s)]
*  You don't have to kill all of them to send them down on a on a decline. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3486.94s)]
*  But I would love to do the stellar sea cow. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3491.34s)]
*  And I will say publicly it's I've said a hundred times. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3493.5s)]
*  You don't listen to me. It's a hundred percent on the list. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3496.82s)]
*  We just can't grow it in anything. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3499.2200000000003s)]
*  So I got to get artificial wounds to work and we got to get it to work for elephants. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3500.86s)]
*  And then eventually we could do cellar. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3505.1000000000004s)]
*  I would love to do cellar. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3506.7000000000003s)]
*  You got amazing. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3508.5s)]
*  Talk about the business model that gets your evaluation of where it is. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3510.5800000000004s)]
*  Is it spinning off breakthrough medical ideas? [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3515.3399999999997s)]
*  It's really it's really it's I would say originally. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3518.3399999999997s)]
*  And this is what's been cool. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3522.7s)]
*  You know, like one of the things I think we're good at [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3524.18s)]
*  is we're also good at saying what we don't know. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3527.2599999999998s)]
*  And the original pitch deck deck, which Peter saw, which was moderately shitty, [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3529.94s)]
*  was, hey, George Church says he can bring back a mammoth. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3536.98s)]
*  We're pretty sure that we make money somewhere in there. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3540.2999999999997s)]
*  But we don't know. Right. That was kind of. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3542.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. And so here's how it's evolved. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3544.8999999999996s)]
*  And here's kind of the three ways that it's evolved. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3547.8199999999997s)]
*  It then became tech, which is working. Right. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3551.06s)]
*  You know, we we've spun out two companies publicly, Orm Bio and Breaking. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3554.3399999999997s)]
*  We spent on a third one that we can't talk about yet. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3559.22s)]
*  But I'm super excited about its valuations already over one hundred million dollars [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3561.06s)]
*  in the seed. I think it's super cool. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3564.62s)]
*  I don't think it will have any philosophical debates on what to call it. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3567.66s)]
*  So it's cool. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3571.7s)]
*  It's like it is what it is. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3573.5s)]
*  And so so I'm super stoked about that one. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3575.78s)]
*  We have another one in embryology that we're really excited about, [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3578.6600000000003s)]
*  that we're working on, that we got to go a little further. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3582.54s)]
*  I think it'd be helpful to IDF clinics. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3585.98s)]
*  So there's technology, which is what you get. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3588.1800000000003s)]
*  There is a long term. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3591.54s)]
*  And this is a [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3593.54s)]
*  this is a not really a science thing. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3595.98s)]
*  This is more of working with governments and working with [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3598.62s)]
*  auditors, ecologists and whatnot. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3603.98s)]
*  But you've probably heard about carbon credits. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3605.98s)]
*  There's now a new thing called biodiversity credits. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3608.34s)]
*  It's getting a lot of traction because some of the problems with carbon credits [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3610.8199999999997s)]
*  is not that they're manipulatable, but they're sort of manipulatable on some level. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3614.5s)]
*  But certain things like biodiversity credits aren't right. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3618.58s)]
*  Like you can understand and quantify the value that a forest elephant brings [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3621.98s)]
*  to Gabon. Like that's now a thing. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3628.74s)]
*  Like it's like it's like research by people like PwC. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3630.86s)]
*  It's certified by Lloyds of London. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3636.06s)]
*  And so there now is becoming a biodiversity economy where in part of that, [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3637.9s)]
*  it's really helpful because if you can put the value of an animal, right, [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3643.34s)]
*  this is the old hunting adage, right, where people are like, well, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3647.42s)]
*  if we kill a lion for one hundred thousand dollars, it's a good thing [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3650.7799999999997s)]
*  because we're putting or saying that lines were one hundred thousand dollars. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3653.74s)]
*  Don't poach them. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3656.58s)]
*  I feel as though I'm not a hunter. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3657.5s)]
*  I've never killed anything intentionally, probably goldfish. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3659.46s)]
*  But like that was intentional. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3662.42s)]
*  But it's like I wouldn't like I as not a hunter, I at least can step back [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3664.1400000000003s)]
*  and understand what they're trying to stay there on some level, even though I think [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3670.2200000000003s)]
*  that's partly manipulated so that they can achieve what they want to achieve. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3674.34s)]
*  What I'll tell you, though, is that I do think that if you do put [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3678.38s)]
*  things of value, people tend to protect. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3682.5400000000004s)]
*  And so if you can protect an animal [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3685.66s)]
*  and it has a certain value that you can trade against, it becomes some sort [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3688.02s)]
*  of a commodity play. And what we're seeing is with this Paris [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3693.18s)]
*  agreement that, you know, 62 percent of the pledges [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3698.78s)]
*  pledged nature based solutions, rewilding, restoring ecosystems, [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3704.18s)]
*  restoring bogs, all these types of things, right. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3708.42s)]
*  And wetlands and so in animals are critical to all of that. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3711.42s)]
*  And so where we think that market's going is accommodation of biodiversity credits, [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3715.02s)]
*  nature and carbon credits into what will probably end up being called nature credits. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3720.46s)]
*  That's highly quantifiable. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3724.46s)]
*  And the variant trade on it will probably be based on sexy factor. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3727.06s)]
*  Like you have a lot of these companies [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3731.94s)]
*  that cannot become carbon negative because they're in the mining business, [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3734.3s)]
*  they're in the oil extract, they're in the extraction economy. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3737.78s)]
*  Right. And we still live on some level. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3740.86s)]
*  We still live in a world where there's not unlimited, you know, [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3743.18s)]
*  or there's unlimited solar, but there's not unlimited, you know, cold fusion [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3747.06s)]
*  and stuff like that yet. Right. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3751.54s)]
*  And so, like until that happens, we still have some point. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3753.4199999999996s)]
*  There'll still be a transitional period where you have an extraction economy. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3757.2999999999997s)]
*  Well, if you put a value on nature, then you can create annuities based on that. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3760.8599999999997s)]
*  And so we're working on models around [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3765.02s)]
*  rewilding that turns the animals into annuities. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3767.8599999999997s)]
*  And so if we can show that we can make these animals with this genetic diversity, [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3770.8599999999997s)]
*  think about an annuity that's not only growing and is highly valued because of [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3775.4199999999996s)]
*  a company like Chevron or Simutomo or Exxon or whoever would buy those credits [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3780.1s)]
*  because they have to be from a compliance perspective or kind of an ESG. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3784.5s)]
*  And they're kind of social good perspective. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3788.3399999999997s)]
*  They are also annuities that multiply because they have more babies. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3792.06s)]
*  They cause more of a. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3796.14s)]
*  So the second thing that we are now pretty deep in. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3797.18s)]
*  Right. And so the science has to work to do that, [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3800.7s)]
*  which is proven to be on the right track. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3803.74s)]
*  And then the third thing that's interesting is while we open source, [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3806.02s)]
*  we didn't know this. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3810.2599999999998s)]
*  I talked to Peter about this offline like six months ago, [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3811.18s)]
*  but we open source all of our technologies for conservation. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3815.02s)]
*  So anybody can use our technologies for conservation. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3818.22s)]
*  We also started a foundation with 50 [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3820.3s)]
*  billion dollars to go fund conservation projects, right. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3822.2599999999998s)]
*  They're innovative. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3824.86s)]
*  By the way, congratulations on that. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3825.8999999999996s)]
*  And I just people need to. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3828.1s)]
*  That's huge. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3829.3799999999997s)]
*  You know, but it's like, but it's not a dire wolf. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3830.62s)]
*  Yeah, what embargo? [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3836.7799999999997s)]
*  And so those are my life. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3838.74s)]
*  But the but yeah, the foundation is great. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3842.02s)]
*  And we're working right now to get another big donation that once again aren't [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3845.14s)]
*  coming from conservation, they're coming from tech people that we're trying to [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3850.2999999999997s)]
*  bring tech into conservation. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3853.1s)]
*  So this is new money to conservation. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3854.62s)]
*  And but what we're finding is, you know, even I think you'll love this, [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3856.26s)]
*  Salim, because it goes directly to open source software. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3861.18s)]
*  You know, if you build open source [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3864.06s)]
*  software, you build a community, people start to use it. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3865.14s)]
*  Devs start to use it. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3867.54s)]
*  But then you have someone like the Red Hat, [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3868.66s)]
*  Microsoft type opportunity where it's like, OK, we want to go implement this at [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3870.82s)]
*  scale for Cisco. We don't want our developers to do that. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3875.06s)]
*  We love that you have all this documentation. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3879.2200000000003s)]
*  You guys made this code. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3881.66s)]
*  We want you to do it right. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3883.18s)]
*  And so while we open source all this for governments and NGOs and everyone else, [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3884.8999999999996s)]
*  we are now having governments saying in our hands, we think we can get this done. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3889.54s)]
*  But in your hands, we'll pay you. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3894.7799999999997s)]
*  And there's one government that's trying to get a recovery of a species. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3898.2999999999997s)]
*  It's going to cost them about 300 million dollars to get to that species. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3902.94s)]
*  And it's going to take 23 years. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3907.22s)]
*  We can do it in less than three. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3909.5s)]
*  And we can do it for like 70 million dollars. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3911.38s)]
*  And so it's not just the 33 million. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3914.78s)]
*  It's like that could go to more recovery efforts or education or water or whatever. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3917.7400000000002s)]
*  It's the fact that we can recover species in less than two decades. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3922.98s)]
*  And so we're starting to see these [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3928.1800000000003s)]
*  government opportunities like biovolts and other things where it's like, you know, [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3929.7400000000002s)]
*  this is work, right, so it's not free. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3935.34s)]
*  It'd be easy if it was all just free. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3937.26s)]
*  But we're now saying, how do we build a [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3938.82s)]
*  consortium of partners around the world where we can also bio bank all species, [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3940.98s)]
*  but not just put them in a freezer. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3945.82s)]
*  Like, how do we build pluripotent stem cells? [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3947.86s)]
*  How do we do immortalized cell lines? [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3949.94s)]
*  How do we do sequencing? [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3951.6600000000003s)]
*  Well, all of that's compute money, right? [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3953.02s)]
*  Someone's got to pay for that. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3954.94s)]
*  So I think that we can offer this like, you know, redundancy model as well as kind [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3957.2200000000003s)]
*  of this acceleration if people want it. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3963.06s)]
*  But once again, we're happy to have people [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3965.5800000000004s)]
*  just use all of our stuff for free. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3967.58s)]
*  Then when am I going to go to L.A. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3969.06s)]
*  Zoo and see a colossal dire wolf or a, you know, some woolly mammoth? [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3971.22s)]
*  I mean, that has to be a important future business line where it's [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3979.5s)]
*  it's scientific education, right? [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3987.34s)]
*  I mean, you'd have lines winding around any of these facilities. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3989.18s)]
*  It's a really it's a really great question and we get it a lot. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3994.94s)]
*  And in the early days, we had a lot of folks from that community want to like, [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=3999.1800000000003s)]
*  where do we what do we have to do to sign up first, both nationally, internationally? [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4006.02s)]
*  But, you know, as we've spent a lot of time thinking about it, [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4010.0600000000004s)]
*  I think it's more likely that you will see them in a ecological preserve being back [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4014.1400000000003s)]
*  in their natural habitat than you're going to see them in Los Angeles. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4020.1000000000004s)]
*  So you do have to travel, unfortunately, you have to travel to their locations. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4024.62s)]
*  But but I also think that that, you know, one of the things that we've started [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4027.7400000000002s)]
*  to have conversations with with governments is the brand building [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4030.82s)]
*  that that can do for the country. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4034.7400000000002s)]
*  So we're talking to northern states of the United States [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4036.54s)]
*  and we don't want to be exclusive. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4039.02s)]
*  So like, you know, [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4040.42s)]
*  our exclusionary, you know, like people, [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4043.06s)]
*  people argue the zoo thing to us all the time in a positive route. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4046.02s)]
*  They're like, but if you made a zoo, like, [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4049.5s)]
*  what about kids that want to see this and get inspired by it? [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4051.62s)]
*  Because there's been all these studies that show that zoos actually are good for [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4054.46s)]
*  people care more about animals if they go to zoos as a kid. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4057.98s)]
*  There's like actual peer reviewed science that shows that like not all zoos are [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4060.22s)]
*  Tiger King, there's great zoos like the San Diego Zoo. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4064.22s)]
*  They do great stuff. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4066.62s)]
*  You know, groups like the AZA and others are trying to do more to conservation. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4067.66s)]
*  So you've got that right. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4071.8199999999997s)]
*  You've got that. And we're seeing that that works. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4073.42s)]
*  What I would tell you, though, is, you know, our focus is on [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4076.46s)]
*  rewilding back into the ecosystem. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4081.58s)]
*  And so the two things that we've talked about and I don't know where we'll end up [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4084.1s)]
*  on it is, you know, we've said to like Tasmania, you should once, you know, [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4088.22s)]
*  once we have enough thylacines and once they're back in genetically [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4093.66s)]
*  receptive to be reintroduced, we've gone through a very thoughtful [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4096.9s)]
*  feasibility study of rewilding them, they're benefiting the ecosystem. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4101.78s)]
*  You should offer ecotourism to see them back there. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4105.58s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4109.9s)]
*  And then, you know, not like there's like there's this thing that I didn't even know [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4111.139999999999s)]
*  existed, but there's like a sloth cam and there's like a bald eagle cam and there's [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4115.139999999999s)]
*  all these cams. But it's like, how do if you can't we don't want to be exclusionary. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4118.66s)]
*  So if you can't afford to go to Tasmania, [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4123.179999999999s)]
*  which is really not the easiest place to get to, I go several times a year, [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4125.259999999999s)]
*  the the, you know, how do we bring that [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4129.78s)]
*  experience to you without making it about exhibition of the animals? [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4133.0599999999995s)]
*  And so we've been talking a lot about this. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4136.94s)]
*  We've actually been talking to a lot of education partners, including the [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4139.3s)]
*  Australian government, about how do we do content? [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4142.14s)]
*  Right. Which I know is the same. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4145.14s)]
*  Peter's like seeing a mammoth in in real life. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4146.9400000000005s)]
*  But, you know, I and so so we don't have an answer. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4150.18s)]
*  I think the short answer is we'll put [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4153.38s)]
*  animals back into the wild with collaborations with indigenous people, [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4155.740000000001s)]
*  groups in private land and governments for the purpose of ecosystem restoration. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4159.18s)]
*  And then how do we put the science on display? [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4163.58s)]
*  Because the animals are awesome. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4166.46s)]
*  But how do we bring the science on display? [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4167.86s)]
*  Right. Because that is something that Jurassic Park nailed, [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4170.179999999999s)]
*  regardless of whether you how you feel about Jurassic Park, the movie. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4172.7s)]
*  A lot of people know about genetics because of Jurassic Park and that, [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4176.099999999999s)]
*  you know, who cares about the Rotten Tomatoes score that did something like [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4181.42s)]
*  there are geneticists today that don't want to make dinosaurs, but went into [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4184.0199999999995s)]
*  genetics because that movie got them excited about genetics. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4187.66s)]
*  And so we were filming a docu series. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4190.5s)]
*  We you know, we'd like to build more educational content. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4193.82s)]
*  What I hear, Ben, is you've got an incredible respect for the life that [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4197.78s)]
*  you're bringing back and it's not your goal to to commercialize it in a crass fashion. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4203.42s)]
*  Right. And so that so I would rather us [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4210.26s)]
*  put animals back on ecological reserves, protect them. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4213.219999999999s)]
*  We don't even know. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4216.66s)]
*  I mean, you know, but very few people know where the actual wolves are. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4217.74s)]
*  But like the but like we'd rather get them back in the wild doing [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4220.62s)]
*  a thing in the wild. Maybe there's ecotourism like Kruger National Park, [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4227.9s)]
*  where money goes back to help the environment, help the indigenous people, [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4231.46s)]
*  help the local communities. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4234.099999999999s)]
*  Maybe we do something like that in collaboration with governments. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4235.58s)]
*  But then, you know, but to your question, how do we also it is awesome science. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4238.58s)]
*  So how do we we're trying to film everything? [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4243.0599999999995s)]
*  How do we put how do we put science on display, not animals on display? [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4245.54s)]
*  And we don't have an answer yet. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4250.219999999999s)]
*  I have a fun question. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4252.3s)]
*  You and I have a common friend who's [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4255.22s)]
*  another extraordinary moonshot entrepreneur by the name of Palmer Lucky. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4258.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Palmer's great. Yeah, Palmer's amazing. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4263.780000000001s)]
*  I'll be doing a follow up podcast with him in a couple of weeks. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4266.38s)]
*  And when I get together with him, I brainstorm, OK, what would be a great X [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4271.3s)]
*  Prize, you know, what should we be doing? [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4274.820000000001s)]
*  Because he's one of the teams competing in our wildfire prize. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4276.5s)]
*  In fact, he was the very first person to register to compete in the X Prize [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4280.06s)]
*  wildfire, and he's got a crazy solution, which I love. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4284.58s)]
*  But we brainstorm. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4288.38s)]
*  And so one of the prize ideas that we [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4289.9s)]
*  kicked around over dinner was the idea of an uplift prize. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4292.26s)]
*  Can we uplift a species? [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4297.54s)]
*  Can we take, you know, a dog and make it far more intelligent or, [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4300.62s)]
*  you know, shall we say, plant of the apes, [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4307.22s)]
*  introduce the genes that increase intelligence to these animals? [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4310.58s)]
*  Is that something that's that's, you know, putting aside the moral ethical? [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4314.66s)]
*  It's a very Palmer Lucky. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4319.02s)]
*  Yes, it's about as Palmer Lucky as it gets. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4321.02s)]
*  Right. And sometimes Palmer gets a mixed rap, but he is so brilliant. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4324.9s)]
*  He's absolutely so passionate about the safety of America. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4330.78s)]
*  And, you know, I've seen the people attack him online. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4336.1s)]
*  And it's like. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4339.099999999999s)]
*  I want people like Palmer that wake up every day that are that smart and that are [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4341.179999999999s)]
*  like working on a defensive weapon system or an offensive weapon system that is a [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4347.259999999999s)]
*  deterrent for some bad guy not to hurt my kid. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4353.0599999999995s)]
*  And so I want them on your side. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4356.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you want them on yours. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4359.98s)]
*  We are lucky to have all. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4361.299999999999s)]
*  I'm a huge. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4363.339999999999s)]
*  I mean, obviously, he's a friend full disclosure. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4364.62s)]
*  And I think very highly of him. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4366.7s)]
*  But sometimes he gets this polarizing thing because it's like, you know, [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4368.66s)]
*  it's cute to go to the grocery store and drive your car or Tesla or whatever and [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4372.38s)]
*  think that that all is free and it's just not. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4378.66s)]
*  And you've got to have our incredible armed forces and people supplying them like [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4382.18s)]
*  Palmer to make our way of life possible so that we can do this and we can do it. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4386.86s)]
*  It's wonderful that we can debate whether we can call it a dire wolf or not versus [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4392.7s)]
*  someone killing us for that. Right. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4397.18s)]
*  And that's fucking amazing. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4398.860000000001s)]
*  And so anyway, back to your question, [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4400.54s)]
*  I think that [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4403.06s)]
*  there are genes associated with that that could be associated with intelligence. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4405.780000000001s)]
*  There's been studies been done in mice, [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4411.820000000001s)]
*  you know, and I think that [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4415.740000000001s)]
*  you can do noninvasive sequencing of really smart animals. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4418.9400000000005s)]
*  You know, Colossal is never going to work outside of humans. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4423.66s)]
*  We also drew the line at nonhuman primates because we got we get the Neanderthal [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4426.58s)]
*  question all the time. And so we just said, great. Sorry. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4431.0199999999995s)]
*  And then people get sad. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4434.38s)]
*  But what about trying to pick this? [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4435.82s)]
*  And I'm like, there's not really any DNA anyway. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4437.38s)]
*  So, no, we're not making giant apes. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4439.46s)]
*  That's just not that's not that's not what we are trying to do at this time. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4441.34s)]
*  Kong is coming back. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4444.5s)]
*  Yeah, King Kong is not here. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4445.58s)]
*  And so I would say that for us, [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4448.38s)]
*  I do think that if you could make smarter animals like [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4452.54s)]
*  you know, dogs or cats or something that you have that type of relationship with, [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4459.26s)]
*  I think that's interesting. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4463.86s)]
*  But, you know, you also have to be careful, right? [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4466.34s)]
*  Because, you know, [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4468.42s)]
*  I think it's a very important ethical thing to really think through because [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4471.18s)]
*  it's a slippery slope, because then what happens when you make smarter [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4475.9800000000005s)]
*  livestock, right? [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4479.5s)]
*  Then like it's even worse for livestock. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4481.02s)]
*  Right. And so it's hard. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4483.54s)]
*  I mean, it's hard balancing some of the ethical questions in the name of progress [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4485.900000000001s)]
*  of synthetic biology, you know, also. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4492.18s)]
*  So that's what we've I know it sounds like a cop out, [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4496.46s)]
*  but that's why we've drawn some of these lines saying, hey, we're just going to do [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4499.3s)]
*  this, we're not going to do that, because even though I'm not [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4501.9800000000005s)]
*  philosophically against some of those things, [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4505.42s)]
*  you know, we will never work in some of those categories. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4508.3s)]
*  How do you deal with the invasive species problem? [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4511.02s)]
*  For example, the Scottish went into New Zealand and took the gorse bush with them, [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4515.5s)]
*  figuring that would make good fencing and took over the island and [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4520.5s)]
*  and totally messed up the ecosystem. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4524.66s)]
*  So an area I love is gene drives. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4526.46s)]
*  Like nobody and you know, it's crazy is like certain people like the US hasn't been [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4529.9800000000005s)]
*  as pro gene drives as I think they should be. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4534.46s)]
*  But but island nations like New Zealand and Australia are like, OK, [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4537.58s)]
*  we're in trouble with invasive species. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4542.22s)]
*  We have to have new things. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4544.74s)]
*  And I love gene drives because cats, for example, define the gene drive for folks. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4546.3s)]
*  So gene drives are technologies that you can develop where you can introduce them [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4551.46s)]
*  to a population where it will silence or change certain genes within that [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4555.82s)]
*  organism, within that organism, and you can deliver it by food or other things. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4560.62s)]
*  And so right now, Australia is like the face of mammalian extinction. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4565.0199999999995s)]
*  And it's because of cats. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4571.3s)]
*  They've entered like everyone's cats, cats love to have baby cat kittens. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4572.74s)]
*  And the people let their feral cats, cats get feral. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4576.62s)]
*  And then they're killing and decimating these small marsupials. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4580.42s)]
*  Well, there's people now that kill cats in Australia. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4584.14s)]
*  Right. And in America, like you go to like God knows what happened. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4587.0599999999995s)]
*  They shot cat America. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4590.7s)]
*  But it's like, you know, to Australia, if it's not their personal house cat, they hate them. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4591.78s)]
*  They despise cats because it's killing their most unique. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4597.18s)]
*  They have these unique animals and no one else has in the world. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4601.14s)]
*  Right. And so a way to handle that in a very thoughtful way that is healthy for [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4603.34s)]
*  the animals is you introduce gene drives where that cat eats it instead of it. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4610.9s)]
*  It's not poison. It doesn't die. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4615.3s)]
*  It has an offspring. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4616.98s)]
*  So it does have another generation, but that offspring cannot give rise to more [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4618.7s)]
*  offspring. It's effectively sterile. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4623.18s)]
*  So then after a few generations, there just are no more cats. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4624.82s)]
*  But they get to live out their natural lives. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4630.0199999999995s)]
*  They just don't get to over procreate. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4632.42s)]
*  Right. It's got a lot of attention back about five, six years ago when gene drives [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4634.5s)]
*  were being put forward to basically decimate mosquito populations. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4639.46s)]
*  And everyone. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4643.82s)]
*  And I think the biggest concern is, [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4645.14s)]
*  you know, everyone's seen one too many movies. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4648.0199999999995s)]
*  Right. And so like you got Resident Evil and then people are like, oh, you make a [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4651.099999999999s)]
*  gene drive and then it turns it's all into zombies. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4655.219999999999s)]
*  Right. It just doesn't work like that. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4658.179999999999s)]
*  And so what I do, I do think that or like one of the Mission Impossible, I think they [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4660.9s)]
*  had targeted a bio weapon around that stuff. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4666.219999999999s)]
*  And so you have to be thoughtful about this. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4669.46s)]
*  But I do think that you can [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4671.86s)]
*  silence certain [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4674.3s)]
*  or not. I think you can silence certain [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4676.46s)]
*  procreation in animals using gene drives, especially where it's invasive. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4678.54s)]
*  And I mean, we're doing kind of the opposite of a gene drive with these [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4682.660000000001s)]
*  marsupials, right? That's right. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4685.820000000001s)]
*  If we if we make supercoles, then we don't have to engineer all of the other [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4687.22s)]
*  marsupials to eat coals because the coal are to eat the cane toads. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4693.02s)]
*  The coals love eating the cane toads. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4695.9800000000005s)]
*  So then they eat the cane toads. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4697.620000000001s)]
*  So then they don't die. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4699.9800000000005s)]
*  So their numbers rebound and they recover. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4701.06s)]
*  But at the same time, there's other marsupials that don't eat those cane [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4703.26s)]
*  toads, so then they don't die because there's no there's there's less cane toads. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4706.62s)]
*  So, you know, I people think this is playing God. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4709.780000000001s)]
*  People think this is geoengineering. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4713.9800000000005s)]
*  But I mean, we introduce the cane toads and we're [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4715.780000000001s)]
*  we're geoengineering by default anyway. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4719.58s)]
*  So every day, every day. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4722.42s)]
*  And so we should start being thoughtful on this. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4725.06s)]
*  I love the arguments that GMO is bad for you. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4728.900000000001s)]
*  It's like, oh, my God, that's all we've ever done is genetically modified everything. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4731.58s)]
*  We've just been shitty at it by selective. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4736.0199999999995s)]
*  So I use the I use the analogy. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4738.7s)]
*  Slow and shitty and I'm the analogy of film photography to digital photography. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4740.62s)]
*  We've been doing breeding for thousands of years and nobody says anything. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4746.14s)]
*  Now we've got the digital photography. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4749.62s)]
*  We can do that scale. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4751.46s)]
*  And everybody's like, oh, my God, we should be. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4753.0599999999995s)]
*  Well, we look at a pug. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4755.38s)]
*  Yeah, look at any of this. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4757.98s)]
*  Oh, my God, we should breed a bunch of stuff together that enter the pug. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4759.9s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4765.54s)]
*  Ben, quantum sciences, quantum computation, quantum tech. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4766.86s)]
*  How much do you think about that as the next layer? [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4773.54s)]
*  Yeah, where does that fit in? [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4777.379999999999s)]
*  I mean, I think it will be a game changer for specifically simulation design for [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4779.0599999999995s)]
*  editing and and and if you feed enough data and do the model on top of on top [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4785.5s)]
*  of quantum, you could get you could get, I think, pretty good at predicting not [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4792.14s)]
*  just genotype to phenotype relationships and get pretty good at understanding, [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4796.74s)]
*  you know, what [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4801.34s)]
*  negative effects would be from editing. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4804.02s)]
*  And so in predictions of editing, like, hey, here's the 50 spots you should go [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4805.860000000001s)]
*  at it, you know, we always say the better we are at computation. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4810.34s)]
*  This annoys people, but it's true. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4813.78s)]
*  Every edit has a risk. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4815.54s)]
*  Every edit has a risk. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4817.22s)]
*  It just has a risk. And we don't we to the question you asked earlier about when do [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4818.46s)]
*  we know everything about the genome? [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4822.9s)]
*  You know, I think for humans, it's that but for all life, who knows, right? [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4824.66s)]
*  It's going to take quantum, [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4828.139999999999s)]
*  get the AI before we can truly understand it for all life. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4829.22s)]
*  And I think that I think what's interesting about quantum is if you could simulate [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4832.22s)]
*  these things and simulate those edits, we always say the less edits we can make, [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4837.62s)]
*  they get the desired outcomes and the loss phenotypes. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4843.38s)]
*  That that's the safest for the animal. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4848.26s)]
*  That's the same. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4850.7s)]
*  Like if you could, if it takes a thousand [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4851.900000000001s)]
*  edits to make a thousand of it, but if you can do it in three, do it in three. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4854.38s)]
*  Right. It's it's we have a very programming. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4857.7s)]
*  Like this won't come to surprise you. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4860.74s)]
*  But we think about this like programming. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4863.06s)]
*  Right. It's like if you could do something [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4865.78s)]
*  in three lines of code versus a thousand lines of code, you should do it in three [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4867.860000000001s)]
*  lines of code. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4871.5s)]
*  So I think quantum will be a game changer. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4873.98s)]
*  I just I don't like I meet with like I see Will every year from MIT. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4876.34s)]
*  He's great. And it's just like, but it's like, I never know. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4881.06s)]
*  Like quantum quantum sensing is here, but in quantum sensors are here. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4885.62s)]
*  But it's like in like quantum comms is kind of here ish. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4891.82s)]
*  But it's like, I don't know when we're really going to get there. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4896.06s)]
*  I thought Microsoft's breakthrough earlier or last late last year on some [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4900.18s)]
*  of their chip architecture is really interesting. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4904.34s)]
*  But, you know, when is it going to be truly here? [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4906.38s)]
*  Still, to me is a question mark. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4910.38s)]
*  It's it's two years every two years. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4912.02s)]
*  You employ ethicists. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4916.02s)]
*  In the company, don't you? Yeah. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4918.9800000000005s)]
*  What are they what are they debating right now? [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4922.26s)]
*  Well, I mean, [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4926.34s)]
*  I mean, we we every single species we bring on, we go through a pretty rigorous [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4928.099999999999s)]
*  process and include obviously them in that, you know, right now we're talking to them [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4932.219999999999s)]
*  about one of the biggest things we're talking to them about is, you know, [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4938.94s)]
*  the current conservation. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4942.86s)]
*  You know, we want to we're opening sourcing these technologies for conservation. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4944.099999999999s)]
*  We're making Red Bulls working on these [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4947.219999999999s)]
*  projects, but then you get the it's kind of our ethicists right now are focused [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4949.94s)]
*  mostly on how do we recognize like I think that conservation is a bipartisan [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4955.38s)]
*  issue and and by the way, we hear that from the government, not just we don't just [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4962.9800000000005s)]
*  look at both sides of the aisle, like a go look at who retweeted us. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4967.9800000000005s)]
*  Right. It's like you've got Biden's number one advisor and you've got Elon. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4972.06s)]
*  Like you kind of both sides of the aisle. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4976.62s)]
*  Right. And as far as the the political spectrum, we think that this is these are [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4978.5s)]
*  really important technologies and conservation important. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4982.78s)]
*  Right now, the bioethicists are helping us think through how do we educate the [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4985.0199999999995s)]
*  existing people on and how do we bridge? [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4990.78s)]
*  How do we how do we show these technologies off from an ethics perspective, [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=4997.179999999999s)]
*  but also be able to rise above the politicizing of it on either side, not just one side. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5002.86s)]
*  And so they're going kind of a step [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5008.98s)]
*  beyond even the bioethic side, thinking about how do we have these dialogues? [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5011.0199999999995s)]
*  Because, you know, I was really sad that within a 24 hour period, we made a huge [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5015.54s)]
*  leap forward for conservation using these technologies by the federal government. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5021.82s)]
*  But because it was by this government, it's seemingly bad. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5025.7s)]
*  And, you know, I don't philosophically agree with that. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5029.46s)]
*  And so, you know, I think that we worked great with the last administration. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5033.58s)]
*  We're working great with this administration. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5038.299999999999s)]
*  There's pros and cons to every administration. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5040.26s)]
*  And so I think we just have to. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5042.860000000001s)]
*  But I watch Bill Maher every week [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5045.620000000001s)]
*  to probably show you where I lean on a lot of these things. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5048.54s)]
*  And, you know, Bill Maher's show last week was really telling. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5050.860000000001s)]
*  Right. And if you haven't watched, I highly recommend people watching it. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5053.660000000001s)]
*  It's a great episode. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5056.620000000001s)]
*  I think having a refusal to have a dialogue. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5057.46s)]
*  Because one party or another party is super polarizing, you can acknowledge [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5063.46s)]
*  they're doing bad things or you can acknowledge you don't agree with them. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5068.58s)]
*  But refusing to have a dialogue, that is as ignorant as as things that you may [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5071.38s)]
*  accuse another administration of doing. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5077.54s)]
*  So, you know, I think it's a testament. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5079.74s)]
*  There's a testament here to your ethics and your MTP, where you're able to work [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5082.3s)]
*  with either side of that aisle because of the and the objectives, the open sourcing. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5088.14s)]
*  I love the fact that you're open sourcing everything. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5093.34s)]
*  It's such a huge thing for the world. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5095.5s)]
*  It's really great to have somebody like you be at the forefront of something like [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5098.780000000001s)]
*  this because it could go so badly so many other ways. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5103.860000000001s)]
*  And you're navigating a very fine line of breaking through science, but doing it [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5107.06s)]
*  in a very, very thoughtful, ethical, even a spiritual kind of way. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5111.54s)]
*  So I just want to hats off to you and all that. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5114.660000000001s)]
*  No, it's really it's really kind of you. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5116.9800000000005s)]
*  Like I got feedback, pretty negative feedback from from someone I respect [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5118.9800000000005s)]
*  in the community, in the conservation community, because they said that I was [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5123.58s)]
*  empowering this administration and I was like, there's a difference between [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5127.74s)]
*  empowering and educating, and if you don't educate people and you don't show up, [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5131.139999999999s)]
*  I think it's always better. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5135.66s)]
*  We showed up for the last administration. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5137.26s)]
*  We're going to show up for this administration. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5138.86s)]
*  And we're going to show up for the next [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5140.0599999999995s)]
*  administration, because like we said at the beginning of this, [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5141.0599999999995s)]
*  we are looking at conservation and de-extinction. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5144.0199999999995s)]
*  We're looking at this on a 50 year horizon. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5146.98s)]
*  And that goes beyond a four year party or an eight year party. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5149.139999999999s)]
*  It goes way beyond that. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5152.9s)]
*  And this this to me is as big of as an existential threat as anything else. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5154.66s)]
*  My 13 year old heard I was doing this. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5159.94s)]
*  So he did a quick book run in his class [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5162.18s)]
*  and his class collectively asked the following question. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5164.26s)]
*  What's the next species that we can look forward to? [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5167.34s)]
*  I don't want to let your kids down. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5171.78s)]
*  We are on target for the mammoth by end of 2028. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5175.46s)]
*  We feel good about that. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5177.74s)]
*  But the editing is moving really fast. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5179.099999999999s)]
*  You know, we have done 300 edits in a Dunn-Art cell. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5181.9s)]
*  And so if the Dunn-Art, this is a bad, not answer. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5185.139999999999s)]
*  But if there's a 13 and a half day gestation on the thylacine, [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5189.58s)]
*  if the if editing progresses at the same exponential rate than it is, [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5193.34s)]
*  I think the thylacine could be the mammoth. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5197.139999999999s)]
*  And if we saw PGCs in Dodo's because of the easy, not easiness, but the easy or [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5199.0199999999995s)]
*  it's a pretty self-contained system being an egg, they and you don't have to solve [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5205.62s)]
*  IVF or smacks on the transfer in a non-model species, then the Dodo could be. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5210.26s)]
*  So I mean, right now it's kind of a three [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5215.38s)]
*  horse race and it's unclear who's going to win. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5218.06s)]
*  Not that it's a competition. We love all the species equally. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5221.02s)]
*  Gestation periods play into this, right? [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5223.9400000000005s)]
*  So what is the gestation period of an elephant? [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5226.38s)]
*  Twenty two months, twenty two months. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5228.820000000001s)]
*  Wow. For any pregnant women out there, can you imagine 22 months carrying crazy? [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5231.34s)]
*  And the thylacine is how many how long? [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5238.5s)]
*  Thirteen and a half days. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5240.78s)]
*  Yeah. Talk about two ends of the extreme. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5242.38s)]
*  And the chickens, a chicken, which is what we use as a surrogate, [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5245.1s)]
*  we use these genetically modified chickens for the surrogates for 30 days. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5248.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5252.38s)]
*  Ben, you know, Slene, you have a closing question, but I just want to say thank you [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5254.18s)]
*  for all the work that you're doing. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5258.38s)]
*  I've never I have said this over and over again. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5260.1s)]
*  The difference that a individual can make [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5263.3s)]
*  in birthing a company is extraordinary. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5266.7s)]
*  And I want all the entrepreneurs out there listening to understand that. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5269.58s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5274.46s)]
*  It's you can have the idea, you can have access to technology. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5275.78s)]
*  But if you've got a compelling CEO who [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5280.26s)]
*  builds a moonshot team, is driven by a clear, measurable vision and passion. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5284.26s)]
*  You've attracted hundreds of millions of dollars at a, you know, [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5290.86s)]
*  at a 10 billion dollar valuation, which is I don't want to say it's insane, [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5295.46s)]
*  but it's massively impressive and you're executing over and over again. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5300.18s)]
*  So thank you. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5305.1s)]
*  And in four years and four years, I remember that I have to say one thing. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5306.42s)]
*  I remember the early in the earliest days, because when you when you started Colossal, [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5310.58s)]
*  the idea of a de-extinction company for the woolly mammoths had been around [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5316.34s)]
*  for some period of time and people have been working on it. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5320.18s)]
*  And it had been extremely slow in the nonprofit world. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5323.0199999999995s)]
*  And people were upset that this moved into the for-profit world. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5327.0599999999995s)]
*  But guess what? [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5331.62s)]
*  It's like hitting the, you know, the acceleration button when you did that. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5332.74s)]
*  Well, that's one of the that is one of the things that we often get is like, [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5337.62s)]
*  there's an article that came out a couple of weeks ago, said, [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5341.099999999999s)]
*  you can't trust a for-profit. It's like, well, we are very honest that we are going [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5343.099999999999s)]
*  to make a lot of money off the rewilding. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5347.94s)]
*  Like I said that here. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5350.339999999999s)]
*  We think that we'll make billions of dollars on the animals being back in their natural habitats. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5351.46s)]
*  We also think that we will make billions of dollars off of the tech that we're building. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5356.54s)]
*  And so for us to be able to give that technology and subsidize, [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5360.9s)]
*  people don't realize this unless they've done technology development. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5365.62s)]
*  They think of research and development as free. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5368.38s)]
*  Well, it's typically a lot of research and very little that goes into development. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5370.42s)]
*  A lot of this stuff just doesn't work. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5374.22s)]
*  And I love that there's a metaphor merging in my head, which is you're not just [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5375.9s)]
*  incubating and bringing back all species. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5379.62s)]
*  You're actually an incubator and a womb yourself for breakthrough technologies [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5382.54s)]
*  that change everything, that change humanity and change everything, which I think is awesome. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5387.14s)]
*  It's very meta. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5391.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5392.5s)]
*  And we're I mean, we're look, we're having fun and I think we're making a difference. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5393.22s)]
*  And so that's all we can do. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5397.42s)]
*  It's rare that I get to say that I get to say I'm jealous about somebody's job, [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5398.82s)]
*  but I think you might have it. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5403.02s)]
*  It is a it is a three sixty five, seven day a week. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5405.42s)]
*  But I like I don't have I always joke that I don't have friends or hobbies. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5409.06s)]
*  So I mean, I do have friends, but I work with all of them in some level, right. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5412.54s)]
*  On some level. So I just it's fun. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5416.3s)]
*  I love what we do. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5419.34s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5421.42s)]
*  Ben Lamb, CEO of Colossal Biosciences. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5422.580000000001s)]
*  Thank you, buddy, for your work. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5425.620000000001s)]

*  I'll be chatting with him shortly as well. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5428.660000000001s)]
*  Salim, as always, love having you in this conversation with me and for everybody. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5430.5s)]
*  So where do folks go to learn more about Colossal? [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5434.860000000001s)]
*  So we're just at Colossal on [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5437.42s)]
*  X and we're then go to Colossal dot com and find the rest of our social channels. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5441.26s)]
*  And when you go, if you listen to this podcast, you know, go to your friends and [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5447.18s)]
*  say, did you hear about the miracle that occurred last week? [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5451.14s)]
*  It's extraordinary. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5453.74s)]
*  Three dire wolf pups that have been extinct off the face of the earth for 12000 years [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5454.9400000000005s)]
*  are back again. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5462.9400000000005s)]
*  And that's that is incredible. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5464.860000000001s)]
*  They're also cute. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5466.66s)]
*  Cute. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5468.3s)]
*  Congrats on the baby, which is a real startup. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5470.74s)]
*  Yeah, it is a real startup. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5474.14s)]
*  Learning that in a hard way, too. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5475.62s)]
*  So, yeah, all right. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5476.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's a self-learning startup. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5478.22s)]
*  It's I have my I have my own large language model continually growing. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5480.34s)]
*  It's interesting. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5484.9s)]
*  You have to be looking at your the birth and your and your son very differently [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5485.74s)]
*  given the business that you're in. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5491.66s)]
*  Yeah, my my my son has no idea obviously what I do and [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5493.98s)]
*  I think he'll really like it or not. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5501.42s)]
*  I think it'll be a moderately binary outcome. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5503.7s)]
*  I just can't wait to neither of our 13 year olds have any idea what we do either. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5506.299999999999s)]
*  So don't take it the wrong way. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5510.66s)]
*  He's pretty curious, like at an early age, he's really weirdly curious. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5513.099999999999s)]
*  And so I think I think he'll dig it. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5516.299999999999s)]
*  We'll see. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5517.82s)]
*  We'll see what kind of pets he grows up with his in his teenage years. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5518.46s)]
*  Awesome. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5522.9s)]
*  All right. Take care, guys. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bAf4t1CwY&t=5524.179999999999s)]
