# Latest AI News, Apple Vision Pro & Bitcoin Surge w/ Salim Ismail | EP #87
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [February 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM)
*  We're going to see the convergence of AI Vision Pro and then crypto and blockchain, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=0.0s)]
*  all those things coming together, just reinventing industry after industry. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  That augmentation, I think, is unbelievable and very, very powerful. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=8.96s)]
*  There's just no way human beings should be focused on driving when a car can do it much [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=14.84s)]
*  better than you anyway. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=21.8s)]
*  We're at a point now where the amount of compute coming from silicon is exceeding 8 billion [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=22.8s)]
*  mines worth of compute. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=28.64s)]
*  A 7 trillion dollar raise? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=30.16s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  AI's can create, spin up a billion, a hundred billion simulations and therefore know a lot [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  more about where these different roads are going to go and therefore by virtue of that [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=41.2s)]
*  level of multi-universe simulations could generate tremendous wisdom. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=46.2s)]
*  We won't be able to navigate a volatile world in the future without that lens of depth and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=51.24s)]
*  operating in real time to help make sense of the world. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=57.96s)]
*  Hi everybody, Peter Diamandis here. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=60.96s)]
*  Welcome to Moonshots. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=64.48s)]
*  I'm here with the most amazing exponential thinker I know of, Salim Ismail, the CEO of [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=65.48s)]
*  OpenEXO, my partner at Singularity University. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=71.4s)]
*  Salim, good to see you buddy. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=74.28s)]
*  Let's talk about what in the world just happened in tech this week. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=76.36s)]
*  I call it WTF in tech. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=79.36s)]
*  In particular, I'd love to talk about things like the Apple Vision Pro, AI raising 7 trillion [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=81.88s)]
*  dollars and what's going on in the world of Bitcoin, which is more than just 7 trillion [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=89.96s)]
*  dollars. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=95.96s)]
*  You're well? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=96.96s)]
*  All good. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=98.6s)]
*  I mean, those are each major Gutenberg moments that each of them will change the world fundamentally. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=99.6s)]
*  They are for sure. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=104.56s)]
*  Just kicking this off, we are in a period of Apple Vision Pro's takeover. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=106.2s)]
*  It's taking over on the pages of X and all of my friends are rushing to go and get theirs. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=113.64s)]
*  I love this story for me broke when I saw this image and I love this phrase. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=120.68s)]
*  It says we're not going to need to worry about overpopulation after all. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  So beautiful. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=134.6s)]
*  These two guys are sitting there at a cafe wearing their Apple Vision Pro. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=135.6s)]
*  Have I ever told you the joke? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=142.88s)]
*  What does an engineer use for birth control? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=145.6s)]
*  No. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=149.0s)]
*  His or her personality. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=151.6s)]
*  So I think that says it all in this. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=153.16s)]
*  As a former engineer who struggled to meet women, I can totally attest to that from personal [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=160.68s)]
*  experience. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=166.12s)]
*  But, you know, listen, everybody walking around with these and I've been seeing them on X. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=167.12s)]
*  I haven't seen them out in the wild yet in terms of people walking around, but I'm sure [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=173.72s)]
*  we will. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=178.68s)]
*  Let me share this image. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=180.28s)]
*  This is an image of Apple's first generation products from the MacBook to the iPad to the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=182.6s)]
*  iPhone and there's the Vision Pro. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=189.48s)]
*  It says a lot, doesn't it? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=193.56s)]
*  You know, their ability to deliver breakthrough new platforms, computing platforms that are [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=196.2s)]
*  all in one has never been beaten, challenged or even come close to. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=203.16s)]
*  It's pretty staggering. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  I think there's no question that when they make a decision to release a product, it's [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=209.92s)]
*  going to be awesome. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=213.64s)]
*  And the Vision Pro is, but I think what's most awesome about the Vision Pro, we'll talk [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=215.51999999999998s)]
*  about it, is its integration into the Apple ecosystem. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=220.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=223.44s)]
*  If it was a standalone product by itself, it wouldn't have half the awesomeness. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=224.44s)]
*  But the fact integrates, you know, you can see your Apple Watch as a virtual icon. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=229.6s)]
*  You can integrate with your Mac, with all of the products out there is pretty extraordinary. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=233.96s)]
*  You know, for me, it's the app store. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=240.24s)]
*  You know, the fact that I can just pull up any app and run it and soon they'll have, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=244.04000000000002s)]
*  you know, they have already what, 700 apps that are native to the Vision Pro, right? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=248.56s)]
*  So the richness and depth of those is going to be kind of incredible, I think. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=253.36s)]
*  The thing that they did which was right is, you know, I've got around here some, oh there [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=258.64s)]
*  it is. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=265.0s)]
*  I've got my Oculus Quest 2. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=266.0s)]
*  It's like unboxed. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=268.64s)]
*  I mean, it's unopened. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=269.64s)]
*  It's sitting on the shelf because I had another one I used and I have my Oculus One sitting [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=271.03999999999996s)]
*  someplace and that's the problem with a lot of the XR headsets. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=275.08s)]
*  You get it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=280.28s)]
*  It's really cool for a little bit and then you don't use it again. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=281.28s)]
*  Because the apps just are not engaging enough and it's not useful enough. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=287.6s)]
*  And I think what really was a super smart decision by Apple here was saying, we're going [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  to make this independent of apps. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=299.12s)]
*  We're going to allow you to read your book, do your work, you know, watch movies. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=301.44s)]
*  And so the whole universe of content that you would use on your MacBook is the same [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=307.72s)]
*  universe of content that you'd use on your Vision Pro. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=312.6s)]
*  And that was brilliant. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=315.56s)]
*  I think there's some more extensions that are very powerful. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=317.28000000000003s)]
*  For example, one of the use cases I found that I heard about was if you're sitting [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=320.88s)]
*  on a plane and you want to watch a movie, you are essentially watching it on a big screen. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=324.96000000000004s)]
*  Right? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=330.2s)]
*  And that augmentation, I think, is unbelievable and very, very powerful. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=331.2s)]
*  But I continue to think the real application here is specialist B2B applications like surgery [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=335.96000000000004s)]
*  or training somebody or make sure you install the bolts on the on the Boeing plane before [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=342.28s)]
*  you get it out there and doing visual analysis of things. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=348.03999999999996s)]
*  I think that's where the real power will come in. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=351.8s)]
*  It will, but it's also going to come in from your ability to do mobile computing while [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=354.08s)]
*  you cross the street here. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=359.91999999999996s)]
*  And here's a video of that that BefJezos launched here. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=362.15999999999997s)]
*  And here we see a guy in his Vision Pro just crossing the street and typing away. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=367.76s)]
*  I mean, I do think that this is sort of an evolutionary Darwin moment. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=372.88s)]
*  You know, the Darwin Awards, my favorites, and we'll see how many people get killed [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=377.0s)]
*  with wearing their Vision Pro and doing stupid things. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=382.52s)]
*  It's if not if not doing stupid things, they're just going to get punched just from the, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=386.76s)]
*  you know, the social signaling that comes with this is just has so many connotations [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=393.23999999999995s)]
*  that will attract negative attention. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=398.03999999999996s)]
*  But I think this is it's just dangerous to be doing some of this. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=400.64s)]
*  So, you know, I'm going to check this. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=404.76s)]
*  I'm going to Google this versus using my my Gemini. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=406.64s)]
*  But how many people die each day while taking a selfie? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=409.79999999999995s)]
*  Or actually each year, it's some astronomical number. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=416.71999999999997s)]
*  Oh, here it is. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=421.52s)]
*  So in 2018, a study report showed that 259 selfie deaths occurred. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=422.16s)]
*  I don't know if you've ever heard that. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=428.84000000000003s)]
*  Yes, I have heard that. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=430.24s)]
*  And you're on the ledge. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=431.44s)]
*  You're backing up or you're back up in the traffic. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=433.40000000000003s)]
*  So we're going to have not just selfie deaths. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=436.16s)]
*  We're going to have Vision Pro deaths. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=437.76000000000005s)]
*  And of course, here's another great example. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=440.20000000000005s)]
*  I tweeted this that this was the craziest thing I've seen in years of somebody doing that. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=452.52000000000004s)]
*  I mean, I've driven my Tesla four times up and down the country, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=458.16s)]
*  and I would have killed for something like this, but it's it's unbelievably dangerous. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=462.28000000000003s)]
*  And so I don't know how this can end. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=466.68s)]
*  Well, they're going to have to pass. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=471.48s)]
*  I can't imagine them not passing some regulations saying you can't wear this. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=472.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, I think they have that. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=476.40000000000003s)]
*  I think I think they're going to have to pass. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=478.12s)]
*  I think I think it's called you can't text and drive. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=481.20000000000005s)]
*  And I think they're just going to broaden the definition of texting. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=484.72s)]
*  Yeah, they I think they'll have to. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=487.72s)]
*  Yeah. But but that's why God created self-driving cars anyway. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=490.0s)]
*  You know, this this let's just touch on that for a second. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=495.76000000000005s)]
*  Maybe the biggest delay, most delayed [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=498.6s)]
*  outcome of exponential technologies. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=503.44000000000005s)]
*  I remember 10 years ago, we thought self-driving cars would be prevalent [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=506.08000000000004s)]
*  in a few years, and it's taken way, way longer. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=509.96s)]
*  You know, even now, we're like a few years away. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=513.64s)]
*  It's just because that adaptive intelligence of driving a car is just really, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=516.12s)]
*  really hard and perfectly suited to human adaptive intelligence. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=520.28s)]
*  Whereas a set of sensors with AI, it just makes it's just that much harder to do. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=524.36s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=530.4399999999999s)]
*  But I believe the thesis that if a human can do it [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=532.84s)]
*  with one eye, you know, when I closed, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=537.92s)]
*  a computer should be able to do it with a single camera, let alone all the cameras. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=541.5600000000001s)]
*  You know, it's interesting. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=548.04s)]
*  A couple of things happened in the self-driving world that I think are worth noting. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=550.0s)]
*  The first is that Tesla last year replaced 300000 lines of C++ code [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=553.36s)]
*  with 3000 lines coming from a large language model [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=560.8s)]
*  that was trained on all of the data. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=565.5600000000001s)]
*  People don't realize that when you're driving your Tesla and you grab the... [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=568.88s)]
*  it's in self-driving mode and you grab the wheel, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=573.08s)]
*  all of the imagery before and after you grab the wheel are sent to, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=577.8000000000001s)]
*  you know, Tesla's headquarters to say, OK, why this person interfere [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=583.44s)]
*  with this perfectly good self-driving car? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=586.88s)]
*  And that's training their their equivalent of their, you know, their deep neural networks. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=590.32s)]
*  Equivalent to their large language models. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=594.56s)]
*  The other thing... [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=597.88s)]
*  I'm a huge proponent of self-driving. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=599.0799999999999s)]
*  I mean, human beings are just bad control systems for two ton cars going at high speed. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=601.1199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the idea is that you take a 16 year old test testosterone laden kid [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=606.3199999999999s)]
*  and give them a 2000 or 5000 pound car. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=612.7199999999999s)]
*  It's crazy. It is nuts. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=616.0s)]
*  I remember the statistic when BlackBerry's were around. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=617.5999999999999s)]
*  There's about three day outage in BlackBerry messages around the world. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=620.3599999999999s)]
*  Nobody could send BlackBerry messages for about three days. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=623.88s)]
*  And the accident rate in Abu Dhabi during those three days dropped 40 percent. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=626.96s)]
*  Wow. Right. That was 10 years ago. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=631.32s)]
*  Forget everybody. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=633.12s)]
*  Anybody you look at in a car is looking at their phone. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=634.32s)]
*  So it's just there's just no way [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=636.84s)]
*  human beings should be focused on driving when a car can do it much better than you anyway. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=640.16s)]
*  So the faster we make that transition, all the better for me. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=644.64s)]
*  Notwithstanding, this Waymo car got attacked by a crowd last night [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=648.88s)]
*  in San Francisco. That was just crazy. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=653.32s)]
*  I miss that. What happened? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=654.92s)]
*  A Waymo car in Chinatown, San Francisco, was stopped and a whole crowd [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=657.84s)]
*  surrounded and just vandalized the car and put it on fire. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=662.08s)]
*  Whoa. Yeah, they just. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=665.88s)]
*  Yeah. And the car couldn't drive anywhere because it was surrounded by human beings. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=668.72s)]
*  Oh, my God. You know, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=673.32s)]
*  this year at the Abundance Summit, I'm going to have Austin Russell there, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=675.84s)]
*  who is the CEO of Luminar. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=680.68s)]
*  I don't know if you know, Luminar is the largest provider of [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=683.76s)]
*  of LIDAR, laser imaging radar. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=688.88s)]
*  And I was at a party for a friend, Adeo Ressi, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=691.76s)]
*  I don't know, six months ago, Elon was there and Austin was there. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=695.76s)]
*  And Austin was wanting to meet Elon. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=700.08s)]
*  So I went and introduced them. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=701.84s)]
*  And I said, Elon, here's Austin. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=704.04s)]
*  He's providing the LIDAR for all of the car manufacturers out there. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=705.88s)]
*  And he thinks that Tesla should have LIDAR. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=710.0s)]
*  And Elon's like, no, absolutely no LIDAR. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=712.8399999999999s)]
*  It is cameras only if humans. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=716.04s)]
*  You know, this is his his first principle thinking. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=718.92s)]
*  If humans can drive with just their eyes, cars will drive just with [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=722.12s)]
*  with cameras. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=727.8399999999999s)]
*  And so Austin made his best argument. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=730.1999999999999s)]
*  But Elon sticking with cameras. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=733.76s)]
*  I would stick with the LIDAR idea just because LIDAR can see so much further. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=737.0400000000001s)]
*  And in different in different conditions. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=743.52s)]
*  Yeah. So, you know, I think all of this is AI. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=746.08s)]
*  And let's talk about what's new in the AI world here. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=751.1600000000001s)]
*  And by the way, it's going to be the intersection, right? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=754.72s)]
*  We talk about convergences all the time. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=757.1600000000001s)]
*  The most interesting places on the planet are the convergences of exponentials. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=758.9200000000001s)]
*  I mean, you talk about that in exponential organizations. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=763.4000000000001s)]
*  With me and your your open EXO. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=767.2800000000001s)]
*  Take a second and tell folks what the open EXO platform is, by the way. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=769.88s)]
*  So what we have done is created a global platform for anybody interested in the [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=774.24s)]
*  transformation that we're going through with technology and action, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=779.0s)]
*  enabling that and making it real. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=783.5600000000001s)]
*  So we have thirty five thousand entrepreneurs, technologists, researchers, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=785.48s)]
*  scientists, innovators, change agents all on a global platform. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=790.24s)]
*  We have a subgroup for generative AI that's about 500 people. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=796.32s)]
*  So every week they get together and talk about what's going on. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=799.4s)]
*  And we've created basically a hive mind for transformation. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=802.1600000000001s)]
*  So anybody that wants to transform their company, their country, their city, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=805.24s)]
*  whatever, it's a passport to all of the tool sets around that. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=809.32s)]
*  So that's what openEXO.com is. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=813.36s)]
*  Yeah. And it's a lot of the stuff that we wrote about in exponential [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=815.6s)]
*  organizations, 2.0 that came out are what that community practices, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=819.08s)]
*  preaches, works on together. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=824.56s)]
*  And I think it's the convergence, right? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=826.4399999999999s)]
*  We're going to see the convergence of AI and VisionPro. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=828.4799999999999s)]
*  AI, VisionPro and then crypto and blockchain, all those things coming together, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=833.3599999999999s)]
*  just reinventing industry after industry. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=837.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. You know, going back to the Singularity University observation of we have a dozen [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=840.68s)]
*  technologies that are all on a doubling pattern, right? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=845.0799999999999s)]
*  Each one is doubling on its own, but where they intersect, you have a whole other [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=848.0s)]
*  multiplier to the equation. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=851.3599999999999s)]
*  And you've mentioned before you take two or three of them. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=853.2s)]
*  Now the multiplier is off the charts. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=855.64s)]
*  So the massive transformation that's being delivered is unheard of and [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=858.24s)]
*  unprecedented in human history. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=863.68s)]
*  Everybody want to take a short break from our episode to talk about a company that's [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=865.4399999999999s)]
*  very important to me and could actually save your life or the life of someone that [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=868.72s)]
*  you love. The company is called Fountain Life. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=873.76s)]
*  And it's a company I started years ago with Tony Robbins and a group of very [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=876.32s)]
*  talented physicians. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=880.72s)]
*  You know, most of us don't actually know what's going on inside our body. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=882.04s)]
*  We're all optimists until that day when you have a pain in your side, you go to the [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=886.36s)]
*  physician in the emergency room and they say, listen, I'm sorry to tell you this, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=891.36s)]
*  but you have this stage three or four going on. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=894.52s)]
*  And you know, it didn't start that morning. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=897.8s)]
*  It probably was a problem that's been going on for some time, but because we never [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=900.72s)]
*  look, we don't find out. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=905.28s)]
*  So what we built at Fountain Life was the world's most advanced diagnostic [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=907.72s)]
*  centers. We have four across the U.S. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=912.8s)]
*  today and we're building 20 around the world. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=914.52s)]
*  These centers give you a full body MRI, a brain, a brain vasculature, an AI enabled [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=917.84s)]
*  coronary CT looking for soft plaque, a DEXA scan, a grail blood cancer test, a [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=923.76s)]
*  full executive blood workup. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=929.36s)]
*  It's the most advanced workup you'll ever receive. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=931.36s)]
*  150 gigabytes of data that then go to our AIs and our physicians to find any [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=934.72s)]
*  disease at the very beginning when it's solvable. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=940.96s)]
*  You're going to find out eventually. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=944.64s)]
*  Might as well find out when you can take action. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=946.52s)]
*  Fountain Life also has an entire side of therapeutics. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=948.76s)]
*  We look around the world for the most advanced therapeutics that can add 10, 20 [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=951.8000000000001s)]
*  healthy years to your life and we provide them to you at our centers. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=955.32s)]

*  It's one of the most important things I can offer to you as one of my listeners. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1000.44s)]
*  All right, let's go back to our episode. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1004.24s)]
*  You know, speak about unprecedented in human history is this next [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1005.92s)]
*  article that came out this week. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1012.72s)]
*  Sam Altman seeks trillions of dollars to reshape business of chips and AI. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1014.8s)]
*  And I'm like, you go guy. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1019.48s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1021.92s)]
*  I mean, honestly, you know, I thought Elon had cojones when he was looking to go to [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1023.6s)]
*  Mars, but a $7 trillion raise. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1029.72s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1034.04s)]
*  And, you know, if we believe that we're turning the world into information, which [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1037.12s)]
*  we are, and all that information needs to be managed and computation and AI, the [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1041.8s)]
*  ways you manage and harness and make sense of all that tsunami of data, then [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1046.84s)]
*  this is completely the right thing to do. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1051.0s)]
*  I mean, when you think about what is $7 trillion mean, I mean, that's like, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1053.44s)]
*  that's half the GDP of the U.S. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1059.52s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1064.56s)]
*  Just about, I think. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1065.76s)]
*  I think GDP of the U.S. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1066.6s)]
*  I mean, it's like the total net value of Apple and Microsoft and Google all put [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1068.0800000000002s)]
*  together. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1074.68s)]
*  I mean, it's a lot of money. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1075.0800000000002s)]
*  Where do you go to get $7 trillion? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1076.0s)]
*  Well, you go where people have, you know, in the UAE, they're generating $4 billion [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1078.3200000000002s)]
*  of net income a day from oil. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1082.76s)]
*  So that's a, and that's just, that's a piece of what's happening in Saudi. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1086.3600000000001s)]
*  So you go where the money is. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1090.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1093.1200000000001s)]
*  Saudi and the Emirates for sure. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1093.5200000000002s)]
*  And I'm just, I don't know. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1096.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1099.8799999999999s)]
*  We talk about moonshots a lot. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1100.2399999999998s)]
*  A $7 trillion ask. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1103.1999999999998s)]
*  I mean, you know, he didn't want to go for a trillion. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1105.84s)]
*  Do you want to go? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1110.1599999999999s)]
*  I mean, I guess if you're going to, if you're going to ask for a large amount of [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1111.04s)]
*  money, you might as well put it all out there. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1114.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1117.84s)]
*  I mean, I think the, the thesis is you would enable many trillions time that, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1118.08s)]
*  right? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1123.4399999999998s)]
*  The economic impact could be that big across all sorts of areas. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1124.72s)]
*  I just don't know. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1129.68s)]
*  He, there's some insights there as to where you would apply all that [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1131.8799999999999s)]
*  computational power to, but it would make computation, massive computation [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1135.2s)]
*  reducible down to very, very small devices and enable every little gadget to [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1140.4s)]
*  be in, become intelligent with this trend is very clear that that's happening. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1144.96s)]
*  You know, it's, if you think about the amount of compute on the planet for all [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1150.1599999999999s)]
*  of, for all of known history, compute was neurons compute was the human brain. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1154.4399999999998s)]
*  And I don't have the exact figure. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1161.6399999999999s)]
*  I should have looked it up before this, but we're at a point now where the [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1164.52s)]
*  amount of compute coming from Silicon is exceeding 8 billion minds worth of [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1167.84s)]
*  compute and there'll be a point in the near future where human compute is a [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1173.3999999999999s)]
*  fraction of 1% of all the compute on the planet. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1178.48s)]
*  And that's a fascinating thing to think about. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1181.52s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1184.68s)]
*  The, the, the, the, my issue with it is that that compute power is different. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1185.3600000000001s)]
*  It's a different type of compute, right? [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1189.56s)]
*  Um, because you've got all this, uh, sensory stuff that we compute in our [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1192.0s)]
*  bodies every day, that a huge amount of our neuron capabilities there was you [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1196.52s)]
*  can use pure compute into all sorts of other areas. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1200.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1204.72s)]
*  Well, uh, regardless, this is going to be an interesting one. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1205.16s)]
*  I haven't honestly heard of a, of a raise that big. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1208.44s)]
*  I mean, we're going to see X dot AI probably raise a few hundred billion. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1212.6s)]
*  Uh, and we've seen, you know, a few of the other AI companies in that category. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1217.16s)]
*  But have you heard of a trillion dollar raise before? [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1222.64s)]
*  Never, not even close. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1225.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1227.28s)]
*  Fascinating. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1228.32s)]
*  Good luck, Sam. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1228.88s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1230.04s)]
*  Um, all right. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1231.0s)]
*  Next one is Google's Gemini advanced AI is ready to go. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1231.88s)]
*  So, um, I've been playing with Gemini and hats off to AI to Google for this. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1238.44s)]
*  Um, I actually didn't like the name Bard. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1245.24s)]
*  I do like Gemini better. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1247.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1249.6s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1250.0s)]
*  I actually like Bard. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1250.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1252.3600000000001s)]
*  Why? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1252.6s)]
*  Great shout out to Shakespeare and the art of composition. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1253.08s)]
*  Huh? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1257.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1258.56s)]
*  It just feels dull. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1259.6s)]
*  Gemini feels well, I've got twin boys, so that maybe it's influencing my mindset here. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1261.2s)]
*  But, um, have you played much with Gemini yet? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1266.96s)]
*  I've played with it a bit. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1271.84s)]
*  I think it's, there's some areas where it's a little weaker. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1273.08s)]
*  And then, but I think overall, uh, when I was playing with Bard now, Gemini, I [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1276.76s)]
*  actually preferred it to many of the other tools. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1282.04s)]
*  So, I mean, the biggest issue is Google is, is playing an existential game here, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1285.5200000000002s)]
*  right? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1291.0s)]
*  In terms of how do you, how do you maintain its behemoth in search and also [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1291.3200000000002s)]
*  put generative AI into the loop here? [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1296.0800000000002s)]
*  And when, you know, how often are you Googling versus using, uh, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1298.4s)]
*  using a generative AI tool? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1302.6000000000001s)]
*  Um, I find those are two very different things. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1305.5200000000002s)]
*  I haven't kind of merged them yet because often I'm, when I'm Googling, I'm [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1308.96s)]
*  looking for something specific. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1312.4s)]
*  Uh, and when I'm trying to compose or flesh out some thinking, then I [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1314.44s)]
*  go to generative AI, right? [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1318.88s)]
*  And so those are, I find are two complimentary, uh, thought processes. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1320.76s)]
*  I do find it very powerful to, uh, when I have a general search query, like, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1324.84s)]
*  find me the best way of doing, uh, doing something or give, get me the best [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1332.76s)]
*  Korean restaurant within 10 kilometers. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1338.96s)]
*  Some of those nuances are not easy and typical search, but, but Gemini does [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1341.3600000000001s)]
*  those very well or Chat GPT does those very well. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1345.76s)]
*  And of course, what's going to happen here. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1348.76s)]
*  And it's pretty damn obvious is everything will transition to a single entry point. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1350.96s)]
*  Um, and whatever you want, uh, it's going to enter through a, an AI, uh, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1356.72s)]
*  interface and it will decide whether it uses classical search or generative AI [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1364.2s)]
*  to give you the answer. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1368.2s)]
*  Um, and so the question is owning the customer. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1369.6799999999998s)]
*  Um, you know, so Google's not, it needs to hold on to that customer because, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1373.84s)]
*  uh, it's, it's in a, it's in a death race. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1379.0s)]
*  I, I happen to believe in Google, uh, uh, as the most viable and dominant player. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1382.3999999999999s)]
*  And I think they'll, they'll maintain, uh, their, their dominance. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1389.9199999999998s)]
*  I love the team there. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1393.8s)]
*  I'm biased. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1395.1599999999999s)]
*  I know I've known them for 20 plus years. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1395.76s)]
*  But, uh, it's, it's a challenge. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1398.24s)]
*  Well, I think what has to happen is, is the others, whether it was Microsoft or [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1401.76s)]
*  Facebook or opening, I have to totally change the paradigm, right? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1406.3600000000001s)]
*  So when chat GPT got integrated into Bing, um, it didn't dense at all. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1410.24s)]
*  Google's search dominance, like zero. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1415.96s)]
*  And so I found that really interesting. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1418.72s)]
*  It's these habits that we have of, of looking things in the way we've [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1420.72s)]
*  done it is unbelievably hard. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1424.2s)]
*  Just going back to my Yahoo days, right? [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1426.24s)]
*  Yep. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1428.2s)]
*  Um, you had the Yahoo mail, uh, page, and if you move that send button by just a [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1428.56s)]
*  few pixels, one way or the other, the usage dropped off pretty dramatically [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1435.0s)]
*  because people are so used to going to that spot and clicking send, right? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1438.92s)]
*  It's incredible how habitual we become with even web pages, very hard to [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1443.24s)]
*  update and change in that pattern. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1447.6s)]
*  I think unless we change the paradigm of how we do search, which is what, uh, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1449.12s)]
*  open AI and Bing and so on are trying to do, uh, it'll stay Google [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1453.6399999999999s)]
*  dominant for a while and Google's got to get out. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1457.52s)]
*  I mean, people will realize that the technology used by open AI, the large [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1460.4399999999998s)]
*  language models were pioneered by Google first. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1465.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1468.48s)]
*  The transformer paper was written by Googlers. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1468.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1471.48s)]
*  I mean, Larry and Sergey, when they started, uh, when they started Google, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1471.9199999999998s)]
*  they viewed themselves as an AI company. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1476.3999999999999s)]
*  Um, and what people don't realize is I think they also viewed themselves [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1479.92s)]
*  ultimately as a brain computer interface company, but we'll see where that goes. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1483.96s)]
*  Do you know, think in Google. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1488.44s)]
*  Um, anyway, it's, uh, it's, you know, we'll talk about, uh, BCI and one [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1491.6000000000001s)]
*  of our next conversations here, but, um, here's a, uh, here's another, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1497.3200000000002s)]
*  uh, AI article that came out. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1503.0800000000002s)]
*  Um, this is Nat Friedman, who is the, uh, founder, uh, or the past CEOs of GitHub. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1506.08s)]
*  We've talked about GitHub before, how dominant and critical GitHub is. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1513.64s)]
*  Um, Nat's going to be giving the opening talk this year, uh, with me, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1518.28s)]
*  fireside at, uh, at abundance 360, contextualizing what in the world just [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1522.48s)]
*  happened in the AI world in the last year and where we're going, but he's had [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1527.52s)]
*  a side project, which I find fascinating. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1531.52s)]
*  Uh, it's the Vesuvius challenge, a little less than a million bucks. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1533.96s)]
*  Uh, so these large, uh, collection of papyrus scrolls were buried at Mount [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1538.0400000000002s)]
*  Vesuvius and 79 AD and here they are, they're rolled up there, you know, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1544.5600000000002s)]
*  they've gone through hell and back literally, uh, and they're going to crumble. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1550.8000000000002s)]
*  And so what Nat and the scientists did was they X-rayed them and were able [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1555.6000000000001s)]
*  to actually get different X-ray diffraction off of the ink. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1560.84s)]
*  And then they took the data from that, those X-rays, which was basically [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1564.4399999999998s)]
*  noise and put it up there for AI scientists to solve. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1568.36s)]
*  And they did, which I find amazing. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1573.9599999999998s)]
*  I think this is just such a great use case of being able to do things [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1578.72s)]
*  that we struggle with as human beings. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1583.4399999999998s)]
*  Um, a deciphering those hieroglyphics, even what it is, and then B making [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1586.72s)]
*  sense of it and three, uh, understanding, interpreting them. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1592.0s)]
*  That's just massive, uh, potential that for me, one of the favorite [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1595.72s)]
*  applications I've got is understanding and translating human to animal language. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1599.8799999999999s)]
*  Um, there was a project in, I think I was tracking 2017 that was trying to [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1605.24s)]
*  use machine learning to, uh, understand and read, write dolphin language. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1609.2s)]
*  And they thought by 2022, they would have a working version. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1614.56s)]
*  It got derailed by the pandemic, but now we'll be able to do it trivially. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1618.4s)]
*  The big problem with that is that let's say you want to talk to dolphins. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1621.92s)]
*  We probably don't want to hear what they have to say. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1625.76s)]
*  Cause I think the big danger point there. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1629.08s)]
*  You know, I just had, uh, as you know, you're on my, on my board at the [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1631.96s)]
*  X-Prize foundation and this year at Visioneering, which is our big event [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1635.68s)]
*  of the year where we debate and we discuss what prizes should we do next. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1639.48s)]
*  Uh, we had two great AI prize ideas that bubble to the top. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1643.52s)]
*  Uh, one that I think is really needed, which is AI for truth. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1647.96s)]
*  Um, and, and that prize we've talked about before is given to Datum. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1652.84s)]
*  Can an AI engine tell me that this is based in fact, this is someone's [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1657.9199999999998s)]
*  opinion or this is actively disinformation. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1663.1599999999999s)]
*  Would so love that. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1666.1599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1667.56s)]
*  And, and so important in today's world of like obvious deep fakes and the [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1668.32s)]
*  this ease with which we can create deep fakes, I think is, is going to pause [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1673.52s)]
*  a massive challenge for our elections and for our media globally. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1677.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1682.72s)]
*  I'm going to show you my favorite deep fake of the week. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1682.84s)]
*  Um, uh, it came out, but before that, going back to, uh, interspecies [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1684.84s)]
*  communications, uh, the other X-Prize we've talked about is just that an [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1690.76s)]
*  interspecies communications X-Prize. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1694.8s)]
*  And, and, uh, I've had some meetings since Visioneering about that. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1696.64s)]
*  And I love the idea that we could talk to a dolphin for search and rescue [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1701.04s)]
*  or talk to birds to say there's a child lost in the forest. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1706.08s)]
*  Can you go help us find it? [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1709.56s)]
*  And one of the questions is, you know, if we're communicating to animals, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1711.2s)]
*  maybe we need to be careful about what we say to them. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1717.56s)]
*  So we don't, um, we don't pollute their mindset, so to speak. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1721.28s)]
*  Uh, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1726.16s)]
*  I mean, it's hard to imagine that we could do much worse than we're doing now. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1726.92s)]
*  Right? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1730.96s)]
*  Like there's all this data about the, the, the vibration by big ships in [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1731.24s)]
*  interfering with whale song all around the world and causing massive barriers [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1735.72s)]
*  and shipping lanes act as like, uh, boundaries that whales, the whales can't [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1740.24s)]
*  communicate through those anymore. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1744.24s)]
*  Uh, so there's all this stuff that's happening negatively anyway. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1746.2s)]
*  And I think anything we can do to understand it and mitigate those is [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1749.04s)]
*  better because now we just have more data about what's actually happening. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1752.64s)]
*  Uh, I want to just read a paragraph about this Vesuvius text again here. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1756.2s)]
*  Um, so it was a grand challenge, $700,000. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1760.48s)]
*  Uh, these 15 columns, this is from a post. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1764.44s)]
*  Uh, these 15 columns come from the very end of the first scroll. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1768.4s)]
*  Uh, we've been able to read and contains new text from an ancient [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1774.24s)]
*  world that has never been seen before. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1777.48s)]
*  The author, probably Epicurean philosopher, Philodeus writes about music, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1779.2s)]
*  food, and how to enjoy life's pleasures. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1784.4s)]
*  In the closing section, he throws shade at unnamed ideological adversaries, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1787.64s)]
*  perhaps the Stoics who quote, have nothing to say about pleasure, either [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1792.92s)]
*  in general or in particular, unquote. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1797.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1799.8s)]
*  Well, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1800.16s)]
*  debates all the way back then. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1802.52s)]
*  Oh, you know, this is the thing. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1804.76s)]
*  Once you have three people, you have politics, right? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1806.88s)]
*  Two people have a conversation. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1808.92s)]
*  Three people have politics. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1810.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1811.8s)]
*  Love that. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1812.1200000000001s)]
*  I remember in our early days of Singularity University, we had, we got to a [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1812.68s)]
*  point where we had 50 alumni from Italy and within those 50 people, there were [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1816.04s)]
*  14 political factions that have been emerged already. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1821.3999999999999s)]
*  Like, how does this happen? [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1824.92s)]
*  And they were going to create a 15th while they were there. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1827.0s)]
*  Um, so the FCC bans AI generated robocalls, right? [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1829.8799999999999s)]
*  So there was this robocall, this deep fake of president Biden telling [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1834.0s)]
*  New Hampshire voters to stay home. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1838.12s)]
*  Um, fascinating again. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1840.04s)]
*  Uh, it's like, I tell people, uh, you were going to default from seeing as believing [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1842.6s)]
*  to actually just not believing, um, and, and what you hear or what you see. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1848.36s)]
*  You know, the, that, that AI for truth idea is such a powerful and important [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1856.8s)]
*  and necessary instrument because unless it's validated at this point, I think you [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1861.8s)]
*  make a really important point here because unless you know something for sure, you [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1868.1599999999999s)]
*  have to basically take it with several grains of salt. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1872.9599999999998s)]
*  So I was talking to Tristan Harris from, uh, who's also going to be on stage with [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1876.28s)]
*  me at the Abundance Summit. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1880.0s)]
*  Tristan's the head of the Center for, uh, uh, humane technologies. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1881.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1886.3999999999999s)]
*  And you know him from his appearance, uh, on, uh, social dilemma, uh, brilliant [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1887.1599999999999s)]
*  thinker and, and the question he asked was, okay, can humans do this? [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1893.4399999999998s)]
*  Could a human, you know, when you're looking to ask, can an AI do this? [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1898.28s)]
*  Can a human, when given some data actually track down whether it's factual [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1901.8s)]
*  opinion or active disinformation? [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1907.6799999999998s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1910.8799999999999s)]
*  No, the answer is absolutely not. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1911.76s)]
*  I mean, look at some of the stuff. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1913.3999999999999s)]
*  Why would you expect an AI to be able to, I mean, given enough time and resources, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1915.7199999999998s)]
*  could a human track it down? [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1919.08s)]
*  Can you go? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1921.0s)]
*  Oh, of course that, that yes, that can be done, but I think in the time [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1921.6s)]
*  scale that we're looking for, that we're talking about, right? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1925.92s)]
*  The, the, uh, Trump won the 2016 election by the fact that lies were spread so much [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1929.0s)]
*  faster than the truth could catch up to it. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1935.6000000000001s)]
*  Um, and you, he, there were, there were 20,000 verifiable black lies that he [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1938.8000000000002s)]
*  spouted out during the 26th from during his presidency, right? [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1946.76s)]
*  So when I talked to, whether supporters or whatever, what aspect of [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1950.68s)]
*  reality are you living in to operate in that model, right? [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1955.68s)]
*  Whether it's redrawing the maps or where the hurricane will hit or whatever. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1959.48s)]
*  And I think this is the enormous difficulty. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1963.2s)]
*  The, the, uh, the, cause you know, remember we had the conversation last [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1966.0800000000002s)]
*  time about how the, we get hit by negative news and we retain the emotional [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1970.0800000000002s)]
*  element of that much more powerfully. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1976.44s)]
*  And then even when reality hits us, it doesn't change the emotional effect of that. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1979.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1983.04s)]
*  I think this is the difficulty. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1983.2s)]
*  You tell me that a politician has beat his kids growing up and you show [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1984.7199999999998s)]
*  some images or so forth, and I know it's not true, but just in the back of my mind, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1988.1599999999999s)]
*  that neuron is poking up and saying, well, maybe it is, maybe there's some truth in [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1994.08s)]
*  it and that erosion of truth. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=1999.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2003.1999999999998s)]
*  And so this, this FCC banning of AI gender robocalls really needs to be the beginning. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2003.76s)]
*  And I think the only way is to make, uh, deep fakes, not avatars. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2009.68s)]
*  I think of avatars as the positive terminology. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2014.88s)]
*  I have an avatar, you have an avatar. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2017.88s)]
*  We have a Ray Kurzweil avatar for our book, but in a deep fake where I didn't [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2019.72s)]
*  give it permission, that should be as illegal as counterfeiting [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2026.72s)]
*  and punishable by jail time. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2030.6000000000001s)]
*  It should be. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2033.64s)]
*  The problem is that a finding out who generated it, right. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2034.9199999999998s)]
*  And finding the source of that generation is going to be very difficult. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2040.6s)]
*  So now the question is, do you make it the responsibility of the transmitter? [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2044.44s)]
*  So in other words, do you, I mean, let's, you know, how do you stop this? [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2048.72s)]
*  Maybe you say that the conduit, if, if, uh, Facebook or X or LinkedIn is sending [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2053.48s)]
*  it unvireifiable and it turns out to be a deep fake that they're penalized. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2060.68s)]
*  Or if you retweet something. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2066.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2069.08s)]
*  So I think that's where it has to go, but that's where you need the AI [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2069.48s)]
*  for truth injected into there, right? [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2073.2799999999997s)]
*  Where, where you have choke points of let's say on X, um, if X had built [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2075.6s)]
*  into it an AI for truth, they could say, and give it a, a, a, a reading on this [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2081.0s)]
*  is 80% likely to be false check carefully and just use a color coding or whatever. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2087.84s)]
*  And just said, this is for sure false. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2093.6400000000003s)]
*  Uh, and deleted it off its platform. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2095.96s)]
*  I think you needed at those information choke points and we're always going [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2098.32s)]
*  to have those choke points just because that's how human beings operate. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2102.04s)]
*  Text Elon and ask him if he wants to do a next X prize. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2105.1200000000003s)]
*  Seriously. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2108.6400000000003s)]
*  I think, I think this is one he probably should want to do. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2109.28s)]
*  He should want to do it. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2112.44s)]
*  And they, all of the tech platform should want to do this. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2113.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2117.4s)]
*  Yeah, no, agreed. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2118.48s)]
*  Um, the question is, can it verifiably be done? [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2119.76s)]
*  And if it can, then can you transmit the authentication through a [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2123.5600000000004s)]
*  blockchain metadata link or something? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2129.92s)]
*  Um, right. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2132.8s)]
*  I mean, yeah, I was the advisor to a project that was actually trying to do [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2133.6400000000003s)]
*  this, um, where they were, if somebody puts out something false, then a bunch [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2138.52s)]
*  of people can look at it and flag it and go, we think this is fake. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2143.0s)]
*  And the rating of the person, the credibility of the person got built into that rating. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2147.08s)]
*  And so they were trying to do using a hive mind, but I think you can do [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2153.0s)]
*  with AI very easily for that. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2155.7599999999998s)]
*  I love that. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2157.52s)]
*  So, you know, people who've got a high as a reporter or as a tweeter or whatever, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2158.12s)]
*  have, if you have a high, uh, you know, uh, truth index, you're not going to want [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2164.0s)]
*  to ruin that, so I'm going to believe you more exactly. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2169.4399999999996s)]
*  And my, and my willingness to retweet your statement is worth a lot more to you. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2173.2400000000002s)]
*  If, if I've got a high index there, um, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2178.2000000000003s)]
*  you know, this is again, I'm not sure we need government policy here, just [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2181.36s)]
*  because the market forces will dictate that this is really important and a [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2184.88s)]
*  button that says this has been verified by an AI is a really powerful economic, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2189.6400000000003s)]
*  uh, uh, motivator for some of this. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2195.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2198.36s)]
*  Um, here is a video by a friend, Andrew Eng. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2199.44s)]
*  He was, uh, with me at abundance 360. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2204.04s)]
*  And I want to listen to his message because I think it's really, uh, quite [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2206.4s)]
*  important and let's talk about it afterwards. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2211.12s)]
*  AI is a very beneficial technology on average. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2213.84s)]
*  I think it comes down to, do we think the world is better off or worse off [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2216.6400000000003s)]
*  with more intelligence in it, be it human intelligence or artificial intelligence? [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2220.84s)]
*  And yes, intelligence can be used for nefarious purposes. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2225.6400000000003s)]
*  And it has been in history. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2228.36s)]
*  I think a lot of humanity has progressed through humans, getting smarter and [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2230.96s)]
*  better trained and more educated. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2235.36s)]
*  And so I think on average, the world is better off with more intelligence in it. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2236.96s)]
*  Um, and it's as, as far as AI wiping out humanity, I just don't get it. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2241.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2245.2000000000003s)]
*  I've spoken with some of the people with this concern, but their arguments for how [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2245.36s)]
*  AI could wipe out humanity are so big that they fall down to it could happen [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2249.56s)]
*  and they can't prove it won't happen any more than I can prove a negative. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2255.32s)]
*  Like that. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2260.0s)]
*  I can't prove that radio waves being emitted from earth won't cause aliens to [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2260.36s)]
*  find us and space aliens to wipe us out. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2265.1200000000003s)]
*  But I'm not very alarmed about space. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2267.8s)]
*  It is maybe I shouldn't be, but I don't know. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2269.48s)]
*  Um, and I find that the homes, um, there, there are real homes that are being [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2271.52s)]
*  created by the alarmist, um, narrative on it. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2276.36s)]
*  I think he puts out deep wisdom here. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2280.48s)]
*  Um, this is very, very important. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2283.0s)]
*  And I think, you know, just in terms of the intelligence side, if you believe the [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2285.4399999999996s)]
*  thesis, the technology is a major driver of progress in the world, right? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2291.2s)]
*  And Ray Kurzweil challenges us to find a better one. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2295.8399999999997s)]
*  Like, is there another major driver of progress in the world? [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2298.72s)]
*  We actually can't think of one. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2301.3599999999997s)]
*  And therefore the more intelligence you have, the more technology you can [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2303.52s)]
*  develop and therefore that's a good thing. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2306.4399999999996s)]
*  I, I, listen, I agree. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2308.8399999999997s)]
*  I think, uh, that there is a direct correlation between a level of intelligence [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2310.44s)]
*  and optimism, uh, empathy, uh, uh, love of abundance of life, of all of those things. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2316.6800000000003s)]
*  You know, I think the more intelligence you have, the more wisdom, right? [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2326.04s)]
*  You can create, I've often said that AI is going to generate credible wisdom. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2330.7200000000003s)]
*  You know, you talk about wisdom a lot, um, in, as part of your, of your work. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2336.28s)]
*  When I think about what is wisdom, um, you know, someone who's wise is someone [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2341.1600000000003s)]
*  who's seen a lot in life, they've experienced a lot, they've heard a lot of [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2345.4s)]
*  stories, they know where this road is going to take you and I think AI's can [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2348.76s)]
*  create, spin up a billion, a hundred billion simulations, uh, of every possible [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2355.08s)]
*  perturbation and therefore know a lot more about where these different roads [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2360.88s)]
*  are going to go and therefore by virtue of that level of, uh, multi, you know, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2366.36s)]
*  multi-universe simulations could generate tremendous wisdom. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2371.7200000000003s)]
*  Completely concur. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2375.88s)]
*  I mean, it's not just even a good thing. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2377.1600000000003s)]
*  It's almost a mandatory thing because we won't be able to navigate a volatile [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2380.52s)]
*  world in the future without that lens of depth and operating in real time. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2384.52s)]
*  To help make sense of the world. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2390.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2392.12s)]
*  Here is, uh, uh, my next conversation point for you. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2392.56s)]
*  Uh, it's something we've talked about. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2397.48s)]
*  Uh, you found this article, uh, put it up for me. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2399.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2404.92s)]
*  So this basically talks about the fact that the big job in corporate America [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2405.12s)]
*  today is the whoever's in charge of AI. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2409.64s)]
*  Uh, you've, you talk about this. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2412.6s)]
*  We talk about this in the book that companies will need a chief AI officer. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2414.32s)]
*  It has to be right at the C-suite level. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2418.8s)]
*  Um, it's, it's such a critical function and enabler that if you don't have this [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2421.44s)]
*  at the C-suite level, then you risk being disrupted, uh, and you won't be around [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2427.0s)]
*  for long, uh, and you make the comment around that kind of existential threat [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2431.84s)]
*  of either your company using AI or you're out of business, right? [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2436.04s)]
*  I love that framing. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2439.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2440.32s)]
*  I say by the end of the decade, you're either fully utilizing AI or you're, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2440.52s)]
*  you're out of business. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2444.4s)]
*  You know, so people ask, what can I do? [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2445.48s)]
*  How do I get started? [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2447.4s)]
*  You know, everybody acknowledges. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2448.44s)]
*  Yeah, I get it. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2449.92s)]
*  You know, it isn't AI that's going to kill my company. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2451.1600000000003s)]
*  It's another company using AI that's going to kill my company. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2453.36s)]
*  And so what do I do? [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2455.7200000000003s)]
*  And my first comment to them is find a chief AI officer and they say, what is that? [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2457.08s)]
*  And for me, a chief AI officer is someone who's on your team. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2462.64s)]
*  Uh, they aren't coding a large language model. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2468.32s)]
*  They're not, you know, they understand what's going on and [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2471.56s)]
*  they're whispering in your ear. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2475.48s)]
*  They understand your business and they're saying, okay, we're going to use, you know, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2476.72s)]
*  this product from Google, this product from, you know, open AI, this product [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2481.12s)]
*  from whatever it might be. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2485.44s)]
*  And in so doing, uh, they're helping you, uh, use the technology that's coming. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2487.2799999999997s)]
*  And that chief AI officer could be, you know, 21 years old for all I care. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2493.8399999999997s)]
*  It doesn't need to be. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2498.8399999999997s)]
*  You want them to be 21 years old. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2499.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2501.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2504.44s)]
*  We have a community member, Diego Saroa. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2505.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2507.88s)]
*  And he's amazing. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2508.56s)]
*  EXO community. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2509.52s)]
*  In my EXO community. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2510.44s)]
*  He's a GSP alumni from Singularity University. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2511.36s)]
*  And he teaches, uh, he's a professor of, uh, at a university called IE in Spain. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2514.6800000000003s)]
*  And he uses AI for grading the papers, advising the students as to how to write [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2521.56s)]
*  their papers, um, uh, different models of researching papers, uh, image generation [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2527.0s)]
*  using mid-journey, he's got a full, a panoply of AI tools that is mandatory [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2533.32s)]
*  for both him and his students to use. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2538.88s)]
*  I think that's where we'll end up very soon. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2541.52s)]
*  Um, the idea of a chief AI officer that can help navigate these models and just [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2543.8s)]
*  plot a course through this is, is absolutely mandatory in my head and not [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2549.16s)]
*  just for companies, but for government departments and for policy think tanks [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2553.36s)]
*  and for pretty much every function where we had human intelligence before you [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2557.6400000000003s)]
*  need an AI assistant going forward. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2562.6000000000004s)]
*  So let's take it a step further, pal. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2565.1200000000003s)]
*  Uh, you know, you and I have talked about having AI board members, having AI [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2567.04s)]
*  executive officers when I'm in a board meeting right now, when I'm in a staff [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2574.0s)]
*  meeting right now, I've got, you know, Gemini open or chat GPT, and I'm asking [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2579.36s)]
*  it the same questions I'm asking my team. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2585.92s)]
*  And in fact, you know, one of the things that I think is incredibly powerful is [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2588.92s)]
*  to say, okay, here's a problem, you know, asking the team what they think of it. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2593.6800000000003s)]
*  And then I might say something like, what would Steve Jobs think of this problem? [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2598.2000000000003s)]
*  And you can post it in that way and say, how would Steve Jobs answer this question? [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2602.04s)]
*  Or how would he market this product? [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2608.4s)]
*  And it's incredibly powerful. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2611.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2615.32s)]
*  So where is this going in terms of taking over the boardroom and the executive suite? [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2615.56s)]
*  Well, you know, we talked in when we launched the book on the impact theory [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2620.2799999999997s)]
*  podcast, Tom Beluse podcast of having the next billion dollar company be three [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2625.68s)]
*  people in a bunch of AIs, right. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2629.88s)]
*  And then Sam Altman, of course, took it to the next level and said, it's one [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2632.08s)]
*  person with a bunch of AIs. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2635.0s)]
*  Well, I would if you combine that thinking and that vector with this concept of an AI [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2636.7200000000003s)]
*  officer, well, there's absolutely no reason why your CMO can't be an AI, why [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2641.6800000000003s)]
*  your CFO can't be an AI, why your CEO almost can't be an AI. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2646.1600000000003s)]
*  I think you'll end up with a C-suite of AIs helping you manage the company with [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2652.8s)]
*  the human being the shoveling of information and data and reports into the AI. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2658.1600000000003s)]
*  Because it's going to do a much better job of summarizing everything. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2664.0s)]
*  What I look forward to is the fight between the CMO and the CFO can be fun, [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2667.0400000000004s)]
*  that project or not. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2670.8s)]
*  And the CFO AI will go, we can't afford it. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2672.0800000000004s)]
*  And the CMO AI will go, we have to have it, et cetera. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2674.4s)]
*  And that'll be the fun discussion for me. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2677.1200000000003s)]
*  You know, this year at Abundance Summit, I've got a generative AI scorecard in [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2679.2000000000003s)]
*  which I'm asking our members to score themselves in all of the business [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2687.84s)]
*  operation functions, like how much generative AI are you using in HR, in [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2692.64s)]
*  legal, in operations, in IT and cybersecurity and so forth. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2697.7599999999998s)]
*  And there are so many incredible tools currently available. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2702.72s)]
*  So you're at a minimum, your executive officer needs to be using these tools to [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2707.6s)]
*  complement themselves right now. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2713.7599999999998s)]
*  I think you're going to end up with what I call the 1995 IBM problem. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2716.24s)]
*  What's that? [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2720.4s)]
*  So in 1995, IBM did a survey of all the CIOs of the Fortune 500. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2721.1200000000003s)]
*  And they said, how many of you use open source software in your computing stack? [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2726.0800000000004s)]
*  And 95% of them said, no, we don't use open source. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2730.0s)]
*  We have totally Oracle, Microsoft, closed stack, computation, software [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2732.4s)]
*  development, et cetera. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2736.1600000000003s)]
*  Then they went down to the sys admins who were running the systems and said, [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2737.6800000000003s)]
*  how many of you use open source? [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2740.48s)]
*  And 95% said, yes. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2741.6800000000003s)]
*  And IBM made a major bet on open source as a result, bought Red Hat, et [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2746.0s)]
*  cetera, and proved to be a huge success because all those sys admins, which were [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2750.0s)]
*  actually using open source, ended up over time becoming the CIOs. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2753.52s)]
*  And I think if you went to a CEO today and said, how many of your people using [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2757.44s)]
*  generative AI? [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2762.4s)]
*  You'd go, no, we're not really using it. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2763.12s)]
*  But down on the ground, they're all using it every day illegally and [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2764.56s)]
*  inappropriately. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2767.6s)]
*  They're feeding half the company's information into chat GPT without [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2768.72s)]
*  realizing it. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2771.84s)]
*  And it's happening anyway. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2772.8s)]
*  So I think that's what you'll find there. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2774.32s)]
*  All right. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2775.92s)]
*  We're about to go to Bitcoin. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2776.16s)]
*  But before we do my favorite deep fake of the week from Super Bowl Sunday, [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2777.12s)]
*  here we've got our president hawking our snacks. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2782.96s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2787.2799999999997s)]
*  It's Super Bowl Sunday. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2788.16s)]
*  For anything like me, you like to be surrounded by a snack or two while [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2789.92s)]
*  watching the big game. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2793.52s)]
*  When buying snacks for the game, you might have noticed one thing. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2795.44s)]
*  Sports drinks bottles are smaller. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2798.48s)]
*  The bag of chips is fewer chips, but they're still charging it just as much. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2800.16s)]
*  As an ice cream lover, what makes me the most angry is that ice cream cartons [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2804.56s)]
*  have actually shrunk in size and not in price. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2808.08s)]
*  I've had enough of what they call shrink flesh. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2811.6s)]
*  Pretty damn believable. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2813.92s)]
*  I think we are in a world where you can't even tell if that was real or not real [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2818.64s)]
*  because you can just as easily imagine it being real. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2823.52s)]
*  I could. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2826.88s)]
*  I could honestly believe it's real. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2829.92s)]
*  And that's scarier than knowing it's a deep fake. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2832.72s)]
*  Hey everyone. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2837.12s)]
*  I want to take a quick break from this episode to tell you about a health product that I love [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2838.0s)]
*  and that I use every day. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2842.64s)]
*  In fact, I use it twice a day. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2844.48s)]
*  It's Seeds DSO-1 Daily Symbiotic. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2846.8799999999997s)]
*  Hopefully by now you understand that your microbiome and your gut health are one of [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2850.16s)]
*  the most important modifiable parts of your health. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2854.3199999999997s)]
*  Your gut microbiome is connected to everything. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2857.2s)]
*  Your brain health, your cardiac health, your metabolic health. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2859.76s)]
*  So the question is, what are you doing to optimize your gut? [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2862.96s)]
*  Let me take a moment to tell you about what I'm doing. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2865.84s)]
*  Every day I take two capsules of Seeds DSO-1 Daily Symbiotic. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2868.4s)]
*  It's a two-in-one probiotic and prebiotic formulation that supports [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2873.36s)]
*  digestive health, gut health, skin health, heart health, and more. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2877.84s)]

*  All right, let's go back to the episode. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2925.28s)]
*  You know, you and I are both huge believers in Bitcoin. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2927.28s)]
*  Let's take the conversation there. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2931.84s)]
*  We were on stage together at an X-Prize event and like every other sentence, [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2934.0s)]
*  like buy Bitcoin, buy Bitcoin. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2937.6800000000003s)]
*  Let's take a look at a couple of images that are for fun. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2940.2400000000002s)]
*  This is from Bitcoin Magazine on X and it's an article here that says, [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2943.76s)]
*  Internet may be just a passing fad as millions give up on it. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2948.0800000000004s)]
*  I think their point is Bitcoin is not a passing fad. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2956.0s)]
*  And I'm going to share one more video here. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2961.6000000000004s)]
*  I love this video. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2964.88s)]
*  This is back in 2013. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2966.88s)]
*  By the way, kudos to you, buddy. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2968.56s)]
*  You're the first person I ever heard speak about Bitcoin. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2972.16s)]
*  I was during one of your talks at Singularity University [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2975.68s)]
*  and you're talking about Bitcoin. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2979.04s)]
*  It was probably 2012 when you were first starting to talk about it. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2980.32s)]
*  Fair enough? [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2985.36s)]
*  No, we were giving out Bitcoin at SU at 2011. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2987.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2990.48s)]
*  Brad Campelton was giving it out kind of as a joke, [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2990.98s)]
*  but people didn't understand it then. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2993.68s)]
*  And frankly, we barely understood it then. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2995.68s)]
*  Let me play this video. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=2998.88s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3001.44s)]
*  I'm right here watching history be made. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3002.24s)]
*  Bitcoin is now up to $111. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3006.72s)]
*  It's an all-time high and it's continuing to rise. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3011.92s)]
*  I've seen it break three times today. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3014.4s)]
*  It went up to 110 and this is the highest that it's been. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3016.4s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3019.2s)]
*  Highest it's been? [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3020.4s)]
*  Ridiculous. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3021.6s)]
*  Well, what you would do with a time machine? [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3024.16s)]
*  Go back by Apple stock early, buy Bitcoin early. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3026.56s)]
*  This is why we know that time machines don't exist [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3029.7599999999998s)]
*  because there's so many obvious arbitrages, right? [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3032.24s)]
*  I was talking to an old friend this morning and she said, [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3036.48s)]
*  I said, when did we last chat? [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3041.52s)]
*  It's been a while. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3042.96s)]
*  She goes, yeah, we last chatted when you told me to buy Bitcoin. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3044.08s)]
*  It was $3,500 a coin. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3047.04s)]
*  I thought, wow, that was a long time ago. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3049.7599999999998s)]
*  This is just the most incredible thing for me. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3053.44s)]
*  I've watched Bitcoin go from $0.05 to $0.50 to $5 to $50 to $500 to $5,000 and now $50,000. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3056.96s)]
*  It's just the most unbelievable, but it's very clear the pattern and it's very clear why. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3067.04s)]
*  I think it's a complete arbitrage on broad awareness and intelligence of what's going on in the world. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3073.52s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to have Mike Saylor this year at the Abundance Summit. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3079.12s)]
*  We're going to go deep on... [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3082.8799999999997s)]
*  Nobody better. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3084.7999999999997s)]
*  Nobody better, right? [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3085.8399999999997s)]
*  One of the largest holders. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3086.7999999999997s)]
*  I guess the ETFs now have more Bitcoin than him as a corporation, but as a private, [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3087.8399999999997s)]
*  not a private company, but as a non-ETF company, he's been just all in. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3092.48s)]
*  Kudos to him. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3100.7999999999997s)]
*  First of all, people should know he's fraternity brother of mine from MIT, [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3102.0s)]
*  my undergraduate years. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3106.88s)]
*  We were basically living together. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3109.04s)]
*  He was aero astro as well. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3111.1200000000003s)]
*  I met with him a few years ago and he told me the story of his Bitcoin logic and he basically [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3115.36s)]
*  went through the logic chain of what it is as a store of wealth, why it's immutable, [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3122.2400000000002s)]
*  why it's energy, how it's going to go. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3127.44s)]
*  How it's going to go. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3130.56s)]
*  Once he reached the conclusion that it is going to become the dominant mechanism for storing [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3132.16s)]
*  wealth and isn't going to be dropping off a cliff, he just went all in over and over [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3141.3599999999997s)]
*  and over again, convinced his board of a public company, which is a big deal and hasn't turned [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3146.7999999999997s)]
*  back and he's laughing all the way to the bank in this one. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3153.68s)]
*  Well, here's one of the calculations I've heard him talk about. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3158.4s)]
*  If one percent of Fortune 1000 CFOs put their treasury into Bitcoin, you'd end up in a [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3162.2400000000002s)]
*  million dollars of Bitcoin. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3174.48s)]
*  There's lots of arguments. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3178.2400000000002s)]
*  I had Kathy Wood on stage with me at the Abundance Summit a couple years ago. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3179.52s)]
*  I'm about to do a podcast with her. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3183.92s)]
*  And same thing, her calculations have it targeting somewhere between a million to [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3185.92s)]
*  five million dollars of Bitcoin. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3192.7200000000003s)]
*  And this is a figure that she posted on X that looks at Bitcoin's hash rate. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3194.56s)]
*  It's at an all-time high, which is pretty amazing, of 500 X of hashes per second. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3200.2400000000002s)]
*  And this is a signal of transaction and demand because a lot of the Bitcoin is not being [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3207.76s)]
*  traded. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3216.2400000000002s)]
*  It's being hashed and created. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3216.64s)]
*  Yeah, and held. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3219.04s)]
*  I think there's some great points here. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3222.0s)]
*  One of them is about two years ago, we crossed more than 50 percent of Bitcoin energy usage [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3225.28s)]
*  was renewable. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3231.76s)]
*  And almost all Bitcoin mining energy is marginal energy. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3234.4s)]
*  Like a hydroelectric dam that's not being used fully and they use the rest of it for [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3240.2400000000002s)]
*  Bitcoin mining. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3244.16s)]
*  So there's some incredible things there. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3245.44s)]
*  I think, can we step back and just give some foundational rationale here? [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3247.2000000000003s)]
*  One is we have 200 fiat currencies that are terrible to manage a global world. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3251.6s)]
*  Define a fiat currency for folks. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3258.7200000000003s)]
*  Fiat currency is the US dollar, the Argentinian peso, the euro, where a country or region. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3260.32s)]
*  It's made up by government. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3267.04s)]
*  It's not backed by anything. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3268.16s)]
*  That's right. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3269.76s)]
*  It's by fiat, by government fiat, the decree that that currency operates. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3270.2400000000002s)]
*  The destruction of monetary value, I think you have a graph on that that's worth looking at. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3276.08s)]
*  The destruction of value in the US dollar is kind of unbelievable to see over a period of time. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3282.16s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3288.08s)]
*  So check this out. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3288.7200000000003s)]
*  Go ahead and tell us what this means. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3290.48s)]
*  What this means is that we, and there's a massive blip if you look at like from 1960s, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3292.88s)]
*  it kind of took its last big collapse downward. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3301.76s)]
*  There was some dips in the depression, et cetera. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3304.48s)]
*  Essentially, when we floated the US dollar, Nixon did it. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3309.52s)]
*  He floated the US dollar off the gold standard and made it a truly floating currency. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3313.04s)]
*  They did not realize at the time that technology was deflationary, [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3319.44s)]
*  that your $1,000 TV will only be worth $500 a year, [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3323.84s)]
*  and you could buy the same thing for $250 a year after. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3327.36s)]
*  And the problem that you have with fiat currencies is they use debt to grow the economy. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3331.36s)]
*  Jeff Booth talks about this in his book called The Power of Now. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3336.8s)]
*  And he made the staggering observation that over the last 50 years, [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3341.2000000000003s)]
*  every dollar increase in global GDP came with a $4 increase in global debt. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3345.12s)]
*  So we're gloring the global economy with debt, which is absolutely not sustainable. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3350.88s)]
*  And if technology is deflationary, you can't borrow money and then pay it back [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3355.36s)]
*  because you have to pay back that much more money. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3359.28s)]
*  And the whole system at some point will implode. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3361.84s)]
*  And so that basically gives a rationale for a deflationary currency that doesn't do this, [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3364.0800000000004s)]
*  which is where Bitcoin fits in. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3370.0s)]
*  And not by accident was Bitcoin created during the 2008 financial crisis [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3371.6000000000004s)]
*  when we just printed a ton of money to save all the banks. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3377.28s)]
*  Wow. And as I'm reading this, Bitcoin is at $49,700. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3380.0800000000004s)]
*  Tipped over $50K this morning. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3386.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, amazing. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3388.0s)]
*  And Vincent Durrani, one of our community members, talks about this. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3390.0s)]
*  He says this is the biggest asymmetric bet in human history. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3393.6800000000003s)]
*  It's either going to go to a million dollars a Bitcoin or it's going to zero. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3396.7200000000003s)]
*  And you're at $50K now. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3399.76s)]
*  So if you buy into it, you may lose $50K, but the upside is so much bigger [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3401.28s)]
*  that you're crazy not to dabble. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3406.88s)]
*  The question is whether governments will try, they will try or succeed in making it illegal. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3410.32s)]
*  So I've, can I rant for a second? [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3417.2s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3420.2400000000002s)]
*  They have been trying. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3421.2s)]
*  They have been trying for ages. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3422.32s)]
*  Okay. There are three things that are notable here. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3424.16s)]
*  One is just over the last few days, a key figure at the Federal Reserve was asked about Bitcoin. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3427.6s)]
*  He's like, oh, it'll never succeed because you can't use it for payments. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3433.28s)]
*  Well, those, how can I say this politely? [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3437.36s)]
*  Those bastards tax every Bitcoin transaction and every crypto transaction as property. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3441.28s)]
*  So it's a taxable transaction, meaning you're prevented from using it as a currency. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3447.0400000000004s)]
*  So they complaining that you can't use it as a currency because they've actually implemented [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3452.48s)]
*  that way. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3456.1600000000003s)]
*  What they've been doing is trying to tax and slow down the on ramps and off ramps of crypto. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3456.8s)]
*  Right? [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3462.88s)]
*  So a lot of the banks that collapsed last year were intentionally forced to close by the [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3463.0400000000004s)]
*  government because they're active crypto trading banks. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3469.44s)]
*  So the government is trying to slow down. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3472.0s)]
*  The best argument I've seen against this is actually, especially in the U.S., is First [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3474.4s)]
*  Amendment. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3480.0s)]
*  So when I send you a Bitcoin, I'm actually sending you an alphanumeric text of string [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3480.56s)]
*  and numbers, which is First Amendment. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3484.88s)]
*  Freedom of speech. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3486.96s)]
*  Freedom of speech. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3487.84s)]
*  So how I interpret, how you interpret that string of numbers is up to you. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3489.28s)]
*  So it's completely not stoppable in the U.S. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3493.12s)]
*  The banks and the financial system were desperately trying to slow down as much as possible. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3496.48s)]
*  But the need for it in global trade and intercompany thing is just crazy. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3501.84s)]
*  I'm on the advisory board of a weird alternative SDR type currency. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3507.6s)]
*  And the founder of it noted a really amazing transaction where a big jet, a big engine [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3512.4s)]
*  company sold a hundred million dollars worth of jet engines to a country and took as payment [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3519.04s)]
*  a hundred and fifty million dollars worth of frozen chickens for these jet engines. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3524.72s)]
*  And the extra 50 percent was now you have to deal with containers of frozen chickens. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3529.4399999999996s)]
*  But the rationale behind it was that governments hate foreign reserves leaving their shores. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3534.3999999999996s)]
*  So they put all these capital controls on it, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3539.7599999999998s)]
*  And it really is global trade is almost run at the big transaction level, run more on [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3543.6s)]
*  a barter system than anything else. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3550.08s)]
*  So you really, really need something like Bitcoin to just to manage all of that going forward. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3552.0s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3557.2s)]
*  I do believe that there is a future where it's all digitized. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3560.8s)]
*  When I have cash in my pocket, it's kind of funny to look at the cash. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3569.44s)]
*  I no longer use coins anymore. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3573.36s)]
*  And I've talked about and written about and we've talked about the six D's of exponentials [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3576.24s)]
*  that when you digitize something, it's a slow, deceptive initial growth and it becomes disruptive. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3581.04s)]
*  It dematerialized, demonetizes and democratizes. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3585.6s)]
*  And so Bitcoin is the digitization of currency of wealth. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3588.64s)]
*  And it's we are in the process of dematerializing the banks and our monetary systems so we can [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3594.8s)]
*  democratize and make it available. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3600.48s)]
*  It goes back to the comment we made in the last podcast about I want to write more about this, [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3602.96s)]
*  but it's permissionless disruptive innovation that we can now do for the first time. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3609.12s)]
*  Nobody asks permission for Bitcoin or Ethereum. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3614.0s)]
*  And yet they're taking over the world from a finance perspective. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3617.04s)]
*  And if governments could find any way of stopping it, they would. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3620.72s)]
*  But you can't actually regulate these in any easy way. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3623.44s)]
*  Here is a little story from this morning. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3627.8399999999997s)]
*  Let's check it out. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3633.2799999999997s)]
*  Welcome back to Squad Box. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3634.48s)]
*  The price of Bitcoin crossing back over the $48,000 level over the weekend one month [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3635.52s)]
*  this after the launch of the SpotBitcoin ETF. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3640.4s)]
*  Anyway, it's going to be something which we may look back at this and say, wow, [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3642.72s)]
*  it used to be that cheap. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3651.2s)]
*  And we'll start talking about Satoshi's versus Bitcoin. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3653.52s)]
*  That's right. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3657.68s)]
*  I think it's absolutely going to happen. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3659.36s)]
*  I mentioned to you watching it go from five cents to 50 cents. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3661.04s)]
*  I finally got the gumption to buy into it at $500. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3664.08s)]
*  And you have no idea how many friends I have that mine Bitcoin at five cents of Bitcoin [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3668.88s)]
*  and then lost the hard drive. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3672.7200000000003s)]
*  It's like unbelievable crocodile tears of people losing the hard drives or losing their [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3674.08s)]
*  private keys. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3678.64s)]
*  And literally about 20% of Bitcoin will never be recovered because of that. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3680.16s)]
*  But as people lose trust in the existing monetary system, they lose trust in the [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3685.44s)]
*  existing monetary systems. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3690.4s)]
*  It's all one big spiral downwards. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3691.84s)]
*  The only tool left of central banks today is to print more money. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3694.96s)]
*  And so this all adds to Bitcoin as a hedge against central banks printing a ton of money, [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3699.52s)]
*  which is what we've been doing forever. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3704.64s)]
*  I mean, what was the stat? [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3706.0s)]
*  We printed 40% of all the US dollars in existence during the pandemic. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3707.2000000000003s)]
*  Naturally, you're going to have inflation and prices are going to go up 40%. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3713.36s)]
*  Well, I mean, that's what this chart of buying power as you print more money, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3716.56s)]
*  the buying power of the dollar is just diminishing. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3723.04s)]
*  And one of the things is you put in real estate, but when you're paying real estate taxes, [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3726.64s)]
*  that's diminishing the value because it just can't hold it. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3732.08s)]
*  And so there's very few things where you can actually maintain that store of wealth. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3736.48s)]
*  And Bitcoin is one of them. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3743.68s)]
*  And, you know, go on. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3745.28s)]
*  I want to make one more comment about Bitcoin versus the altcoins. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3749.6000000000004s)]
*  That's very powerful. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3753.52s)]
*  This again goes back to Jeff Booth, who I think of as the chief economist of the abundance [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3754.32s)]
*  era of the crypto era. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3759.6800000000003s)]
*  He's incredibly smart about this. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3760.7200000000003s)]
*  So there's three triangular points on digital currencies that are important. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3762.96s)]
*  Security, scalability, and decentralization. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3767.92s)]
*  Those are three points that you have to hit to have a decent cryptocurrency. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3771.44s)]
*  And what Bitcoin did for the first time in human history, it hit us decentralization [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3775.2s)]
*  and security at the same time. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3780.56s)]
*  And that was incredibly powerful. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3782.48s)]
*  And except it didn't solve for scalability. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3784.8799999999997s)]
*  So you had all these altcoins pop up to try and solve the scalability problem. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3787.52s)]
*  But in doing so, they compromised on either decentralization or security. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3792.96s)]
*  And we saw FTX collapse. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3797.2799999999997s)]
*  We saw Luna collapse as a result of that. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3799.2s)]
*  But now because of the Lightning Network, Bitcoin has solved scalability. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3801.84s)]
*  So now the smartest people I know are putting all their chips on Bitcoin. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3806.6400000000003s)]
*  Everything else is a gamble. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3810.88s)]
*  And this is a sure bet. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3812.7200000000003s)]
*  And that's, I think, really interesting to mention. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3814.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3817.1200000000003s)]
*  One of the things that Michael said he'll be talking about with us, I think it's on [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3818.0s)]
*  March 19th, is his Lightning Rewards. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3822.56s)]
*  And what he's done is he's built a system at MicroStrategy where if you're an employee [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3826.72s)]
*  and you show up to a meeting on time, you get a few satoshis. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3834.3199999999997s)]
*  If you take the HR learning course, you get a few satoshis. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3838.7999999999997s)]
*  It's basically rewarding you in cryptocurrency at a fraction of a Bitcoin, a satoshi, [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3844.64s)]
*  for every correct action that you take. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3850.72s)]
*  And fascinating idea. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3853.68s)]
*  Which is great if you have 5,000 Bitcoins in your treasury. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3855.52s)]
*  It's harder for other people that they have to go now buy the Bitcoins. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3858.96s)]
*  Well, I think he's got a lot more than 5,000 Bitcoins in his treasury. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3862.72s)]
*  I know. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3865.68s)]
*  I know. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3866.64s)]
*  Well, buddy, listen, a fun week. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3868.72s)]
*  I'm still stunned by $7 trillion fundraise. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3871.68s)]
*  We'll see how far it gets. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3874.48s)]
*  Apple Vision Pro. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3876.88s)]
*  Kudos to Apple for another amazing product. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3878.8s)]
*  And AI every week. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3883.44s)]
*  And you know what? [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3888.16s)]
*  We're still at the very beginning of our AI journey, aren't we? [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3889.36s)]
*  Oh, very, very beginning. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3893.92s)]
*  I mean, look, evolution is intelligence developing and evolving, right? [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3896.4s)]
*  And I think we're hitting a point where now we develop intelligence at an exponential rate. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3902.72s)]
*  And that's just going to... [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3908.08s)]
*  It's just... [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3909.04s)]
*  It is just the beginning. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3909.7599999999998s)]
*  How do we talk about it in the book? [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3911.6s)]
*  The Cambrian explosion has hit. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3912.96s)]
*  And now we've got a bunch of little furry generative AI mammals running around. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3915.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting to think about. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3919.68s)]
*  We think about Apple and Google and Microsoft and Nvidia. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3921.68s)]
*  And 10 years from now, there'll be 100 of those trillion dollar companies that we've never heard of yet. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3926.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3933.12s)]
*  They're going to pop up out of nothing very, very quickly. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3935.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3937.92s)]
*  All right, buddy. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3938.96s)]
*  Quick prediction. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3940.0s)]
*  Where do you think Bitcoin will be the next time we do an episode? [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3940.8s)]
*  Oh, I think it'll dip back down a little bit. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3944.64s)]
*  I hope it will so I can buy more. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3947.04s)]
*  But I'm not going to time it. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3949.76s)]
*  I'm not going to time it. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3950.72s)]
*  I think I had bought Bitcoin as high as when it was near 60 last time. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3952.24s)]
*  And so I think we could see it at 60. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3957.76s)]
*  I predict 70. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3963.12s)]
*  70. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3964.64s)]
*  All right. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3965.36s)]
*  Sounds like you're going to be buying soon. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3966.48s)]
*  All right. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3968.56s)]
*  Good to see you, buddy. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3968.88s)]
*  Likewise. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3970.24s)]
*  See you again next time. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3970.72s)]
*  Take care. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXuFUOvNcGM&t=3971.76s)]
