# The Future of Medicine: How AI Can Transform Healthcare for Billions (FII Panel) | EP #133
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [November 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw)
*  Before we get started, I want to share with you the fact that there are incredible breakthroughs [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=0.0s)]
*  coming on the health span and longevity front. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=4.22s)]
*  These technologies are enabling us to extend how long we live, how long we're healthy. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=7.8s)]
*  The truth is, a lot of the approaches are in fact cheap or even free. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=12.68s)]
*  And I want to share this with you. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=17.0s)]
*  I just wrote a book called Longevity Guidebook that outlines what I've been doing to reverse [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  my biological age, what I've been doing to increase my health, my strength, my energy. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=22.72s)]
*  And I want to make this available to my community at cost. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=27.44s)]
*  So Longevity Guidebook.com. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=30.6s)]
*  You can get information or check out the link below. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=32.660000000000004s)]
*  All right, let's jump into this episode. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=35.32s)]
*  Our panel here today is titled, How Can AI Democratize Health for the Next Billion? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=42.08s)]
*  To contextualize this, I'll simply say that given the development of AI and wearable sensor [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=50.48s)]
*  technology, there is no excuse for a world 10 years from now without a massive increase [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=61.08s)]
*  in health. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=69.4s)]
*  There is no greater wealth than our health. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=72.08s)]
*  Every mother wants one thing for her children to be healthy. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=74.64s)]
*  And I think that's a world that's more peaceful and more prosperous. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=78.76s)]
*  What I'd like to do is ask each of our panelists to just take one minute and introduce themselves [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=83.52000000000001s)]
*  from the perspective in which they're here to speak about this. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=91.28s)]
*  Each of them is bringing a very different, unique perspective on global democratization. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=96.04s)]
*  Will would you kick us off? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=103.4s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=104.64s)]
*  I'm very happy to be here. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=105.64s)]
*  I'm Neil Ahmed. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=107.92s)]
*  I'm the founder and CEO of Whoop. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=108.92s)]
*  We build wearable technology to unlock human performance and improve health. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=111.16s)]
*  A combination of metrics like sleep and recovery and exercise and stress, a bunch of physiological [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  measurements like heart rate and VO2 max and pulse ox, skin temperature. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=123.80000000000001s)]
*  These are all the things that Whoop is measuring. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=131.32s)]
*  As I think about the potential of continuous health monitoring and AI, you can imagine [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=134.0s)]
*  a future in which you have this 24-7 coach that's able to look at all of your data and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  really understand for you what you need right now. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=145.76s)]
*  And that will include lifestyle decisions, that will include diet, that will include [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=149.72s)]
*  when you need to see a doctor or not. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=153.83999999999997s)]
*  And I'm pretty optimistic that the future of health monitoring will make the world a [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=156.88s)]
*  much healthier place when coupled with AI. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=162.38s)]
*  Thank you, Will. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=165.5s)]
*  I couldn't agree more. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=166.5s)]
*  Dr. Oz, what perspective do you come to us with? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=167.5s)]
*  I am a fan of Peter Diamandis. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=171.66s)]
*  If you follow what he's doing, you'll probably do well in life. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=173.38s)]
*  But along the way, I realized that I'm a heart surgeon by training. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=176.98000000000002s)]
*  And much of what we knew was causing chronic illnesses amongst the people I was doing open [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=181.62s)]
*  heart surgery on could be avoided if they took some prophylactic measures. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=186.74s)]
*  So to try to tell folks outside the ivory towers of Columbia University where I'm on [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=190.74s)]
*  the faculty how to do that, I started doing more media. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=195.62s)]
*  So I hosted the Dr. Oz Show, which aired here in Saudi Arabia for its entire course of 13 [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=198.82000000000002s)]
*  seasons and 120 other countries. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=203.9s)]
*  And I learned a lot about how people around the world saw the challenges to health. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=205.98000000000002s)]
*  Early in this process, I launched a show with my partner, Oprah Winfrey. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=210.46s)]
*  We started a company called Sharecare that was run by Jeff Arnold, who is the founder [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=214.74s)]
*  of WebMD. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=220.06s)]
*  And it was the biggest digital health platform in the United States. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=221.18s)]
*  And we began to learn a lot about how to give people digital tools. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=225.26s)]
*  The big lesson we learned is you want to give them rewards, which we'll talk about a bit [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=229.62s)]
*  more as we come along. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=233.54s)]
*  Some of the rewards are informational. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=235.02s)]
*  But oftentimes, you just literally want to give them something. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=237.1s)]
*  And it's especially evident with people in the working place. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=239.22s)]
*  So Mohammed, please stand. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=242.82s)]
*  Mohammed is a pediatric surgeon, our partner here. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=244.54s)]
*  We launched, just agreed with this, with the National Council on Occupational Health to [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=247.34s)]
*  bring this Sharecare platform to all 1.2 million businesses in the kingdom. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=252.54s)]
*  And the effort to get to more than 10 million workers and many more coming from other countries [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=258.9s)]
*  over the next few years is projected, is to get them to be healthier. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=263.18s)]
*  And I'll just give you one fact that might highlight why that matters financially. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=266.65999999999997s)]
*  We ran the numbers in the United States. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=270.14s)]
*  If you can get the average person to retire, not at 61, which is the average, but 64, that [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=271.90000000000003s)]
*  three-year difference in that one-age cohort is worth a trillion dollars to the US economy. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=279.58000000000004s)]
*  That's enough to close the US debt, which is one-third of all the debt we have in the world. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=284.3s)]
*  It's also enough to make our social programs like Medicare and Social Security solvent. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=288.3s)]
*  The same would be true here in Saudi Arabia. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=292.58000000000004s)]
*  And this monograph, which the FII published, if you turn to page 60, this is a list of [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=294.58000000000004s)]
*  the attendees and what everyone is doing to stay healthy. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=299.66s)]
*  So you can pick these up in different places. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=303.02000000000004s)]
*  But in this list, you'll notice two things. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=305.3s)]
*  There's common products like probiotics that are being used by a lot of people. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=308.14000000000004s)]
*  But 20% of the attendees are asking and taking, maybe taking, but asking for Metformin, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=312.38000000000005s)]
*  which is a prescription drug. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=318.18s)]
*  It's linked with longevity. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=319.78000000000003s)]
*  So it's a very sophisticated group here that are looking for ways to biohack and even spa hack. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=321.34000000000003s)]
*  30, 40% are doing cold plunges and sauna. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=327.34s)]
*  So there's a lot of awareness of prevention. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=330.38s)]
*  How do we activate that? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=332.46s)]
*  AI would be the best way to customize. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=333.61999999999995s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=335.85999999999996s)]
*  Dr. Tannenbaum, please introduce yourself and your perspective on this. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=336.9s)]
*  Thank you, Peter. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=342.21999999999997s)]
*  Another huge fan of yours. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=343.17999999999995s)]
*  And thank you for having me. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=344.58s)]
*  I'm Jim Tannenbaum. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=346.05999999999995s)]
*  I run Foresight Capital. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=347.29999999999995s)]
*  We're a three and a half billion dollar health care focused venture fund. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=349.29999999999995s)]
*  We have a great interest in the intersection of AI and health care. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=353.5s)]
*  In general, we believe that over the next decade, there's going to be a profound impact and [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=358.65999999999997s)]
*  change that comes through the two coming together. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=362.82s)]
*  There are two categories of things that we're looking for, things that are more readily [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=366.38s)]
*  integrated on top of the existing health care infrastructure. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=371.34s)]
*  And one way of thinking about this is that we have right now a health care delivery system [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=374.46s)]
*  in the United States and globally, which has a very wide variation of standard of care. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=379.42s)]
*  And AI methods are going to be able to narrow that variation so that we're able to deliver [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=384.78s)]
*  more uniform best practices across patient population. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=391.06s)]
*  And we think that those are the types of things that are going to roll out over the course [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=395.98s)]
*  of the next five years. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=401.14s)]
*  And then there are larger questions about given what we know now, how do we redesign [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=402.98s)]
*  health care delivery? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=408.82s)]
*  And it's interesting here in Saudi, in fact, the government has been embarking on that [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=410.34000000000003s)]
*  exercise. And in the United States, it's very hard to to change a system that's so [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=415.62s)]
*  encumbered and has been around for so long. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=424.42s)]
*  So but nonetheless, we have an interest in looking at a very long term project of [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=428.34000000000003s)]
*  recreating and reimagining health care delivery in the United States. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=433.54s)]
*  Hopefully over the next few years, we'll get involved with something substantial that [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=437.18s)]
*  focuses on that. So those are our interests. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=441.02s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you, Jim. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=444.38s)]
*  Amir Rubin, please introduce yourself and your perspective here. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=446.3s)]
*  Well, thank you. Great to be here. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=449.58s)]
*  I'm in the fan club of this entire row of people, so it's a privilege to be here. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=451.5s)]
*  So my background is in health care innovation and delivery. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=456.46s)]
*  I used to be the CEO at Stanford University's health system. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=460.7s)]
*  And then I was executive vice president at United Health Group, big Fortune Five company, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=463.98s)]
*  and then went to a startup, OneMedical, that reimagined the doctor's office and combined [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=468.46000000000004s)]
*  digital health and in-person care. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=473.02000000000004s)]
*  We took it public and then we sold to Amazon last year. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=475.18s)]
*  So if you're a U.S. Amazon Prime member, you could add OneMedical for nine bucks a month. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=478.14000000000004s)]
*  You could get all you can eat on demand digital health. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=483.58000000000004s)]
*  And then in 31 markets across the U.S., in-person care. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=486.3s)]
*  And what I've seen kind of across my experience is how do you take this great innovation [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=489.9s)]
*  that all these amazing people have shared and how do you fit it into workflows of both [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=498.14s)]
*  kind of the demand side, the problem statements for consumers and employers and payers, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=504.06s)]
*  and the supply side, physicians, clinicians, nurses, care coordinators. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=508.53999999999996s)]
*  And so right now I run a venture firm called Healthier Capital, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=513.98s)]
*  and we're investing in health tech, this intersection of how do we take [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=517.5s)]
*  these great exciting technologies, but yet fit them into the workflow of clinicians. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=521.66s)]
*  And I'll use an example from OneMedical as the kind of things we're looking for. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=527.26s)]
*  So in OneMedical, a consumer within a minute can have 24-7 access to digital health, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=531.9s)]
*  no copay, no deductible, no claims. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=537.66s)]
*  And we charged a membership fee, nine bucks a month. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=540.7s)]
*  So how did we not overwhelm our providers with unlimited demand? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=543.3399999999999s)]
*  So we built our own technology and we first used natural language processing, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=547.5s)]
*  now some generative AI approaches that reads the emails based on the content [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=551.5s)]
*  pulled it out of the physician inbox. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=556.14s)]
*  We then staff a national 24-7 team. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=558.14s)]
*  Not all of them have to be physicians or even clinicians based on the content. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=561.0999999999999s)]
*  Then we had a human in the loop, but then generative AI now helps draft the response. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=565.42s)]
*  So we can take 50% of the tasks off of a physician, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=570.3000000000001s)]
*  yet then have one to two minute response for the consumer. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=574.86s)]
*  So it's an example of how do you blend technology into services. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=577.58s)]
*  But Peter, I want to throw it back to you. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=581.82s)]
*  So I'll play moderator on this end. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=585.02s)]
*  You have an unbelievable background and been a student and fan of you and X-Prize. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=587.5s)]
*  And I know you're a thought leader. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=593.58s)]
*  Please share a little bit about how you're thinking about this in healthcare. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=594.86s)]
*  Sure. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=598.6999999999999s)]
*  I like studying how industries get massively disrupted. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=600.3s)]
*  So the PTTs, the telephone lines around the world, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=606.6999999999999s)]
*  got disrupted when a service that was not 10 times, 100 times better came in [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=611.98s)]
*  and made getting a landline irrelevant. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=619.02s)]
*  And so we see India with Gasham Bani's 5G network just amazing. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=622.46s)]
*  We saw Google come in and make libraries irrelevant. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=632.22s)]
*  I'm interested in completely crushing, destroying, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=637.74s)]
*  obliterating, and reinventing the healthcare industry. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=643.9000000000001s)]
*  And I do think that we're going to get there relatively quickly. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=648.14s)]
*  There's a point at which why would you ever go? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=653.02s)]
*  There is a point at which AI is the best physician, period, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=657.98s)]
*  right, where it's malpractice to diagnose without AI in the loop. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=662.3s)]
*  There is a point at which the most of your data is collected on your body, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=667.1800000000001s)]
*  in your clothes, in your car, in your bed, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=673.5s)]
*  in your urinal all the time. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=676.46s)]
*  And that data is fed up to your AI that's monitoring you, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=679.34s)]
*  not once a year for a checkup, but continuously through your day [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=682.14s)]
*  and finding things at the very beginning. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=686.14s)]
*  So I'm interested in what countries are going to like reinvent healthcare [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=689.26s)]
*  and make US healthcare super jealous that we don't have that. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=695.9s)]
*  I'm not interested in incrementalism. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=701.66s)]
*  So I'm going to start with you Mehmet. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=708.38s)]
*  You have some fascinating data. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=712.62s)]
*  How do you think about the rising billion, I'm going to call it the rising billion, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=715.18s)]
*  and how this will support them? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=723.74s)]
*  You mentioned AI and I share your belief. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=726.46s)]
*  That study, by the way, in your panel when Jack Henry was describing [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=729.5s)]
*  sandbox EQ's large quantitative models. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=732.78s)]
*  Thank you for that opportunity. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=735.34s)]
*  You can moderate. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=738.78s)]
*  I've watched from the best through the years, Dr. Oz, so I'm trying to learn. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=740.38s)]
*  Well done then. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=745.18s)]
*  Give me a word, Woody. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=745.98s)]
*  Quality work. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=747.74s)]
*  The big opportunity with AI, I think, is it's honest. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=750.14s)]
*  Now, I asked that for two reasons. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=754.38s)]
*  Not opinionated. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=755.66s)]
*  I'm sorry? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=757.02s)]
*  Not judgmental. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=757.74s)]
*  It can make mistakes, obviously. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=759.34s)]
*  It can hallucinate. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=761.4200000000001s)]
*  But I'll give you two examples. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=762.22s)]
*  The one classy example that Jack Henry shared with me years ago [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=763.9000000000001s)]
*  when I was first trying to understand what this was, was pathology slides. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=767.1800000000001s)]
*  So if I get a pathology slide in a western country for prostate cancer, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=771.34s)]
*  the pathologists will over read cancer. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=775.74s)]
*  They'll say there's more cancer than there really is. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=778.3000000000001s)]
*  Why would they do that? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=780.7s)]
*  They do because they're humans. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=782.7s)]
*  They don't want to miss a cancer. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=784.22s)]
*  They'll say something is a more advanced tumor than it really is, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=786.3s)]
*  just in case, because they're not sure. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=789.8199999999999s)]
*  Pathology slides read by AI don't make that mistake [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=792.3s)]
*  because they're just bluntly telling you what it is. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=795.58s)]
*  The great number of people have their prostates taken out. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=798.3s)]
*  That's true in the west. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=801.42s)]
*  It's also true in the east. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=802.38s)]
*  But the more pervasive issue today is we have a little bit of an illness industrial complex. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=803.34s)]
*  There's a lot of money spent to make us sick, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=809.58s)]
*  making foods that aren't good for us, subsidizing those foods. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=812.06s)]
*  Sometimes they're addictive foods. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=815.02s)]
*  I think we probably put as much money into tobacco subsidies in America as fruits and vegetables. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=817.9s)]
*  It's just not done in a way that an objectively honest person would want. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=823.26s)]
*  But these are historical realities, why these were done. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=827.34s)]
*  I'm not blaming the people. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=830.06s)]
*  It just is true that we're not doing our best. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=831.02s)]
*  AI generated advice will have to tell you the truth. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=833.34s)]
*  It doesn't fall prey to human failability [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=837.18s)]
*  because it's kind of be kind and an effort to be kind hurts you. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=840.06s)]
*  Like a parent who loves you but does the wrong thing by enabling behaviors. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=843.9s)]
*  It also will take on special interest groups that maybe don't want you to do the right thing. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=847.42s)]
*  And I think if you put those together, we have an opportunity, not just in the west, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=852.38s)]
*  but also in the rising billion to say honorably, your water is so poor [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=856.14s)]
*  that you can't be healthy as healthy as you could because you have arsenic levels, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=861.5799999999999s)]
*  100 times more than they should be. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=865.26s)]
*  So as a country, you need to do a better job with water supply. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=867.18s)]
*  I mean, basic stuff. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=870.3s)]
*  It's not just curing polio, which would be nice also, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=871.58s)]
*  but it actually starts to get into these issues that expose pathology [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=874.46s)]
*  that otherwise we would ignore. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=877.9000000000001s)]
*  How many loops are in circulation? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=887.98s)]
*  You mentioned what you're measuring today. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=892.3000000000001s)]
*  What would be your next three or four things that you would love [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=895.6600000000001s)]
*  to be able to measure physiologically in the body? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=899.9s)]
*  Where are you going? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=903.8199999999999s)]
*  Well, when we first started WOOP, we looked at what were some of the [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=904.62s)]
*  sort of more capable medical technologies out there [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=908.14s)]
*  and how could we put those in a smaller form factor. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=911.42s)]
*  And so initially it was the PSG machine, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=914.06s)]
*  which is like the gold standard for sleep monitoring. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=916.14s)]
*  It was the electrocardiogram, but in particular, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=919.58s)]
*  to be able to measure heart rate variability, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=921.74s)]
*  which is this fascinating lens into how your body's recovering. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=924.14s)]
*  And it was actually the chest strap, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=927.58s)]
*  which is the heart rate monitor from the 80s that athletes wear to train [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=929.34s)]
*  and being able to measure heart rate accurately [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=933.74s)]
*  during all sorts of different activities. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=935.82s)]
*  Now, the good news is we've now been able to take those technologies [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=937.98s)]
*  and put them in a small form factor that has the same level of efficacy. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=940.7800000000001s)]
*  And if I think about going forwards, all the new capabilities [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=945.58s)]
*  will probably go back to a similar place, which is just saying, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=949.74s)]
*  what are all the different pieces of technology that you find in a hospital room [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=953.0200000000001s)]
*  or that are off the shelf, more cumbersome pieces of technology [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=957.1s)]
*  that you'll be able to put in a much smaller form factor, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=962.14s)]
*  much more affordable form factor and democratize. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=964.94s)]
*  Just think about the fact less than 1% of humanity [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=968.86s)]
*  measured their sleep last night. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=973.34s)]
*  Yet we know that sleep is essentially one of the most important things you can do [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=975.34s)]
*  for longevity, for performance, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=981.58s)]
*  for really reversing all sorts of disease dates and everything that could go wrong. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=984.22s)]
*  And yet such a small percentage of society today is measuring it. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=989.5s)]
*  So it's often asked, well, what more can we measure? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=993.98s)]
*  What more can we measure? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=996.5400000000001s)]
*  I think a good starting point is just getting a lot more people [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=997.26s)]
*  to be measuring their bodies because you can only really manage what you measure. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1000.46s)]
*  Sure. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1004.46s)]
*  I'm curious. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1006.86s)]
*  Both of you have been in the medical system. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1011.34s)]
*  Investing in the medical arena. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1014.3000000000001s)]
*  Do we start from clean sheet and work up [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1017.6600000000001s)]
*  or do you try and take the existing systems and improve them? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1023.02s)]
*  Jim, how do you think about that? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1029.42s)]
*  I like your categorization to simplify, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1031.18s)]
*  but are you going to live long enough to see changes made? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1034.14s)]
*  No. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1039.5s)]
*  I mean, I hope spring's eternal. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1040.06s)]
*  I think in venture capital, you start off with macro themes. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1045.18s)]
*  The macro themes bring you to entrepreneurs [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1052.22s)]
*  and the entrepreneurs bring you to investment opportunities. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1055.02s)]
*  So the macro theme is to use AI to make care of delivery more uniform. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1058.54s)]
*  Then the entrepreneurs on the ground that are delivering that [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1064.7s)]
*  have a spread of ways of going about it. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1067.74s)]
*  I would say, ironically, there's not a tight correlation [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1069.98s)]
*  between revenue growth and technology excellence. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1076.6200000000001s)]
*  Can I ask on top of that, do you think that doctors will change [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1081.5800000000002s)]
*  or medical systems will change? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1087.1000000000001s)]
*  I don't believe so. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1091.5s)]
*  I think they're so ingrained in how they do what they do [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1093.26s)]
*  that to get people to actually change is almost impossible. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1097.82s)]
*  Well, I think there's small change and large change. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1103.82s)]
*  And there's who's at risk and who can benefit from change. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1107.4199999999998s)]
*  And in places where people go at risk and they can deliver, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1113.6599999999999s)]
*  we're involved in a cancer care delivery company [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1117.74s)]
*  that's making some changes to the way the cancer care is delivered. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1120.78s)]
*  Originally, we were hoping that they would be really heavy on the tech front. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1124.7s)]
*  They've just been really heavy on the figuring out how to get doctors [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1128.1399999999999s)]
*  to accept various changes that are easy for them to accept. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1131.34s)]
*  How long did it take for cardiologists to accept using AI to read an EKG? [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1136.46s)]
*  Right? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1142.22s)]
*  It's like stethoscope. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1142.78s)]
*  Just now, we're getting doctors to allow AI to analyze acoustic sounds, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1146.22s)]
*  which we're so bad at. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1150.3s)]
*  Objectively, we're bad at hearing. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1151.58s)]
*  It's awful. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1152.9399999999998s)]
*  Austin Flint murmurs. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1153.34s)]
*  Please, Amir. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1155.82s)]
*  I think it's a great question, Peter. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1156.6999999999998s)]
*  I think the answer is both and, meaning I think we're going to have innovation [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1159.1s)]
*  and continuous improvement from within the ecosystem [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1164.22s)]
*  and sometimes we'll have disruptions from without. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1166.9399999999998s)]
*  But if one is naive to how the ecosystem works, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1170.22s)]
*  I like to say big healthcare always wins. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1173.8999999999999s)]
*  But I think also understanding the stakeholder needs. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1178.1399999999999s)]
*  I actually was just with a kind of cancer, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1181.74s)]
*  almost customer relationship management software company [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1185.98s)]
*  that's helping manage patients longitudinally [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1189.18s)]
*  and a lot of practices in community practices, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1191.8999999999999s)]
*  they don't have A, the knowledge base and then the staff to manage [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1195.1s)]
*  kind of the symptoms and follow-up on these immunotherapies. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1198.46s)]
*  So they're not using the latest generation. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1202.06s)]
*  So part of the answer there is, okay, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1204.1399999999999s)]
*  and by the way, they're not getting paid for that time. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1206.78s)]
*  But this panel is about the next billion. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1209.74s)]
*  Let's take it there. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1214.78s)]
*  So I think then the end on the next billion is, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1215.58s)]
*  however, then there are some approaches that can leapfrog these things. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1219.34s)]
*  And we're seeing this now in a lot of this generative AI. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1223.98s)]
*  So I've looked at a number of companies now [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1227.1s)]
*  where a doctor and a patient can sit across from each other [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1229.6599999999999s)]
*  and not only have the system do transcription, document what the doctor is saying, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1232.54s)]
*  but also say, kind of do the differential diagnosis. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1237.18s)]
*  I think it's this, I think it's that, it could be this, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1240.46s)]
*  consider ordering these exams. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1242.6200000000001s)]
*  And I think back to your other point, Peter, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1244.54s)]
*  I think this could be an area like we saw cell phones [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1246.46s)]
*  in some parts of the world leapfrog landlines. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1250.38s)]
*  We could see the same here. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1253.9s)]
*  We may have more regulatory burdens and more stuck in our current ways in the US. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1255.02s)]
*  Actually, I've been spending some time with the Ministry of Health [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1262.54s)]
*  these last couple of days here in the Kingdom. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1264.62s)]
*  It's good to be the king. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1268.54s)]
*  It is. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1270.78s)]
*  And it's also, however, good to have a national viewpoint of regulation. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1271.1s)]
*  We have pros and cons of the US from cities and counties and states, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1276.62s)]
*  but in terms of having a uniform digital highway, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1281.1s)]
*  in terms of having consistent standards, it's very hard to innovate in that. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1284.06s)]
*  Can I put forward the thesis and get your feedback, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1288.54s)]
*  which is the, I'm going to compare the US against Africa in health. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1291.42s)]
*  The US has such regulatory burden and such a disease-based industry, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1298.94s)]
*  sick care industry, that shifting the battleship will be extraordinarily difficult. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1306.7s)]
*  But pick your favorite African nation where there is little, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1314.3799999999999s)]
*  but there's 5G, there's smartphones, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1319.74s)]
*  and with the proper creation of sensor technologies, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1323.82s)]
*  we can have a ground-up revolution using AI to democratize health. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1327.98s)]
*  Just like in Africa, we saw the first cell phone-based currency exchanges using minutes, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1334.86s)]
*  which is an innovation I still would love to have in the US. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1344.46s)]
*  So do you imagine that we might see in five years' time, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1347.8200000000002s)]
*  and I'll remind you guys five years from now, I said this, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1351.3400000000001s)]
*  that we have standards of health care improving in the rising billion [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1354.7s)]
*  at the mass level, not at the wealthiest, but at the general populist level? [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1360.22s)]
*  Well, I think the place that has the most likely for that type of scenario is actually here, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1365.98s)]
*  the Saudi or UAE. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1374.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1375.9s)]
*  And they're already starting and they're doing planning and they're making an earnest effort. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1377.42s)]
*  And Amir has just spent the last couple of days banging around the health care authority here, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1380.94s)]
*  and he can make more comments. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1386.06s)]
*  But I mean, you need a lot of factors. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1387.74s)]
*  You need government that can actually be empowered to make change, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1391.82s)]
*  alignment, long-term thinking, money, and a lot of the factors are here. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1398.3s)]
*  And I think one needs the right financial incentives. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1405.58s)]
*  We can do it also in the US. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1412.3799999999999s)]
*  The system is responding exactly as the financial incentives are. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1414.86s)]
*  Absolutely. You get what you incentivize. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1418.06s)]
*  So AI and health care, we all know where it's applied. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1419.42s)]
*  Revenue cycle, billing, collections, claims. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1422.7s)]
*  That's where all the first money is to be made in AI and health care. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1425.66s)]
*  And everything that Dr. Oz was talking about of digital pathology, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1429.66s)]
*  digital radiology, it's there, but it's much, much slower. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1434.3s)]
*  Why? Is it FDA approval? [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1437.18s)]
*  Is it through CMS? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1439.02s)]
*  Can you get billed for it? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1439.8999999999999s)]
*  How do you get reimbursed? [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1440.94s)]
*  But we've seen, for example, in Medicare for seniors in the US, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1442.46s)]
*  we have 50% of seniors now in Medicare HMOs, Medicare Advantage. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1445.4199999999998s)]
*  Well, there is a financial incentives for the insurance companies, for the groups. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1449.4199999999998s)]
*  And it's not a perfect model far from it. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1453.58s)]
*  But I think to Jim's point, it takes leadership at the national level, at the country level. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1455.74s)]
*  It then takes the right incentives. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1463.18s)]
*  The entrepreneurs will come up with the ideas. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1464.78s)]
*  But just to feed off that, I've been to Saudi Arabia five times this year. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1467.18s)]
*  Wow. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1471.42s)]
*  So and I, as you have been talking to these different... [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1471.9s)]
*  Free-proof flower miles, baby. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1474.46s)]
*  Sorry, they're not a free-proof flower miles that we have not been able to use [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1475.8200000000002s)]
*  one day. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1479.8200000000002s)]
*  I'm going to donate them to Will. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1480.94s)]
*  But what I've noticed here anyway is that the real winning game for health is going to come back [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1483.26s)]
*  down to the issues of making it easy to do the right thing. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1490.94s)]
*  So the Blue Zones approach. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1493.9s)]
*  And there's probably a Blue Zone in the southern part of Saudi Arabia. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1495.3400000000001s)]
*  We know the other places where there are Blue Zones, Okinawa, Sardinia. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1498.22s)]
*  They have done things that just every single day push you to walk a little more. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1501.5s)]
*  Which, by the way, that by itself is probably the single biggest driver of longevity. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1506.94s)]
*  The average American walks 4,000 feet a steps a day. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1510.78s)]
*  In Saudi Arabia, it's less because everyone's indoors so often. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1513.98s)]
*  And the optimal is well over 10. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1517.26s)]
*  But let's just say 7. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1519.74s)]
*  But that's just a basic example that Will can monitor and keep track of. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1521.18s)]
*  But I think those are the kinds of things that ultimately will allow the extra billion people [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1524.54s)]
*  that we're talking about to rise up. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1529.34s)]
*  And I spoke on Monday at the African Summit. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1531.42s)]
*  The same basic idea, the leapfrogging that I mentioned is happening there already with [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1533.74s)]
*  technologies. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1538.06s)]
*  And Orbis is a company that looks at retinal images and does AI evaluation to diagnose [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1538.78s)]
*  everything inside your brain, but a lot of other metabolic illnesses as well. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1544.78s)]
*  Again, we don't do that in most parts of the world, but they just can screen a lot of people. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1548.3s)]
*  But I think monitoring is a big part of it. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1553.1s)]
*  What I'd like to do in our final eight minutes is give each of you two minutes to address [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1555.34s)]
*  that question. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1561.18s)]
*  How can AI democratize health for the next billion? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1561.98s)]
*  I want to bring us back there. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1564.94s)]
*  Will. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1567.98s)]
*  Yeah, and just reflecting on the conversation here, a lot of how, at least I've thought [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1569.98s)]
*  about building WUPE is very customer first or individual first. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1576.06s)]
*  And it strikes me that we've talked a lot about different regulations and what doctors' [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1580.86s)]
*  offices are going to do. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1587.74s)]
*  And we've almost looked at it more from a bureaucracy standpoint. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1588.94s)]
*  But I think that when you talk about a billion people, it's going to come from the users [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1592.94s)]
*  first. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1597.1s)]
*  And we might be able to learn something from the education system right now. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1598.22s)]
*  So it wasn't like generative AI went to the education system and said, hey, we're [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1603.02s)]
*  interested in rolling out large language models. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1608.78s)]
*  We're interested in helping the students better understand how to write papers and answer [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1612.3799999999999s)]
*  questions. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1617.02s)]
*  It was just like all of a sudden, every school around the world woke up to the fact that [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1617.82s)]
*  their students can now write a paper entirely from a large language model. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1622.78s)]
*  And now every school is trying to figure out what the hell do we do with this new world? [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1626.7s)]
*  And they're changing way faster than they ever thought they would. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1630.7s)]
*  And I think what we're going to see happen in health care is that level of disruption, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1634.22s)]
*  where all of a sudden, answers are going to be at the fingertips of individuals around [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1638.46s)]
*  the world. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1643.98s)]
*  There'll be someone wearing a WUPE and the AI layer that sits on top of that is going [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1645.74s)]
*  to tell them they're about to have a heart attack in 30 minutes. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1650.7s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1653.74s)]
*  They're not going to call their doctor and ask. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1654.3000000000002s)]
*  They're just going to go to the ER. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1656.0600000000002s)]
*  And all of a sudden, when these things start to happen in real time, the system is going [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1658.22s)]
*  to have to adapt rapidly. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1663.02s)]
*  And I think what's so powerful about AI, as you're talking about a billion people, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1665.02s)]
*  is that the cost of that level of intelligence is going to be so low that it's going to be [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1669.26s)]
*  touching every individual. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1674.1399999999999s)]
*  And so that's what's going to push the system over. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1676.1399999999999s)]
*  Amir, going to you next. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1678.6999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I think we could have a doctor in everybody's pocket. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1680.3s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1683.58s)]
*  And I think actually, technology-wise, that's here today, at least kind of a triage and [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1684.3s)]
*  diagnostic. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1690.06s)]
*  A doctor or a much better doctor in everybody's pocket? [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1690.78s)]
*  Well, I still believe we need humanity and compassion and also... [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1693.5s)]
*  Do you not think that AI can be more empathic than a human? [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1699.02s)]
*  I think that most humans, probably, possibly. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1704.06s)]
*  I do think... [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1707.4199999999998s)]
*  The data does show that, right? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1708.86s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1710.46s)]
*  And there's good data on that. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1711.18s)]
*  But I think the key here is today, there's a lot of barriers to access information. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1713.42s)]
*  And even if you have great insurance or great resources, even if your name's on the side [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1718.3000000000002s)]
*  of a building... [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1723.18s)]
*  I just visited somebody at Harvard whose name's on the side of the building. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1724.0600000000002s)]
*  I said, how long does it take you to get an appointment? [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1728.22s)]
*  He said, well, I saw a nurse practitioner in 10 days. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1730.3000000000002s)]
*  And his name's on one of the buildings. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1732.78s)]
*  So everybody wants that immediate access and service. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1734.8600000000001s)]
*  And so those initial questions, I think we could have assessed. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1738.94s)]
*  And I think to Will's good point, I was just visiting with the Red Crescent team, the ambulance [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1743.26s)]
*  EMS services here, and they've now got remote telemetry. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1748.06s)]
*  You can measure EEG in the fields so you can get stroke protocol going or door to balloon [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1752.14s)]
*  time faster. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1757.9s)]
*  But if it was on your whoop, I could get that even faster. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1758.7s)]
*  So that's, I think, all very doable. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1762.06s)]
*  The integration into the existing ecosystem is where it'll fall. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1764.94s)]
*  But I agree with what Will said. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1768.7s)]
*  If we could put it in the hands of consumers and people, they'll have that information. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1770.22s)]
*  And I think the technology is here and it's available. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1775.82s)]
*  And so I'm very excited about that. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1779.3400000000001s)]
*  Wonderful. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1780.94s)]
*  Dr. Sannamal. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1781.3400000000001s)]
*  So I agree with the line that everybody's going down. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1782.46s)]
*  Doctor in a pocket concept is already here and now. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1787.26s)]
*  And the problem is it's hard to get a person to trust an AI to deliver their care. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1790.38s)]
*  You know, the whole doctor. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1800.46s)]
*  Do you think that's generational? [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1801.9s)]
*  Over time, it will be. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1805.0200000000002s)]
*  However, I was going to a slightly different place, which is that I think that the places [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1807.0200000000002s)]
*  where it will likely get adopted more readily is where the doctors are accepting of the AI [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1814.06s)]
*  with the patient. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1821.34s)]
*  And I think there's economic alignment in places that are capitated where, you know, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1822.6200000000001s)]
*  for example, you have six months of waiting and you can effectively make a much more [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1828.46s)]
*  streamlined system because now it's augmented effectively, but still doctors in the loop. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1833.74s)]
*  Do you think, Jim, that physicians will spend a quarter million or a half a million dollars [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1839.34s)]
*  going through medical school if they're playing second fiddle to an AI that a nurse practitioner [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1848.54s)]
*  could easily allow? [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1853.98s)]
*  I don't think there's any. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1855.66s)]
*  I don't think there's any decrease in acceptance rates at various medical schools. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1856.62s)]
*  It's still impossible to get into medical school. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1865.58s)]
*  So there's a great deal of interest in it. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1867.18s)]
*  I think the role of a physician and this is actually something I've been interested in [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1869.8200000000002s)]
*  philanthropically, you know, is going to change and evolve. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1873.26s)]
*  What's your vision? [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1877.3400000000001s)]
*  My vision is more of a business, a business man, woman, you know, sort of objective. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1880.0600000000002s)]
*  What's the best sort of processes for me to adopt in order to be able to deliver measurably [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1888.6200000000001s)]
*  the best care, the least expensively? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1895.18s)]
*  So more of a health coach or consultant? [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1897.18s)]
*  Could be, could be, although the AI could power up the doctor too. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1901.66s)]
*  I mean, you're talking about the last mile, you know, and the last mile could come in [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1905.42s)]
*  a bunch of different ways. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1909.8200000000002s)]
*  I mean, it could be on your cell phone if that's the way you like the last mile. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1910.78s)]
*  It could be delivered to you by a nurse practitioner, you know, as well, if you want the human [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1913.5800000000002s)]
*  interaction. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1917.58s)]
*  But I think that in general, physicians that adopt these tools are going to be advantaged [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1918.22s)]
*  and they're going to be advantaged in various systems better than others. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1926.3s)]
*  But I think capitation is kind of one place where, you know, they're just a fixed pot. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1930.46s)]
*  They can do something more efficient. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1935.02s)]
*  They can share more in that pot. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1936.22s)]
*  Dr. Oz, take us home on the topic. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1937.8999999999999s)]
*  I think you teach people how to treat you. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1941.4199999999998s)]
*  That's true in our personal lives. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1945.1799999999998s)]
*  It's going to be true in the medical care system. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1946.78s)]
*  It has not historically been the case because there was a asymmetric advantage to physicians [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1948.86s)]
*  because they had domain expertise. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1954.3799999999999s)]
*  They were a doctor, I mean, doctor, a teacher. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1956.46s)]
*  We're supposed to be teachers, not orderers. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1958.86s)]
*  And I do think the economics of medicine have always been driven to making more money [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1961.5s)]
*  for the people who are providing the care. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1965.58s)]
*  But the people who deserve more value, who will ultimately use AI to drive it for the [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1968.1399999999999s)]
*  extra billion entering the system are the employers, the governments, the people who [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1972.6999999999998s)]
*  need the productivity of people. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1977.1s)]
*  Just being very pragmatic about this. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1979.1s)]
*  If I'm running a business and my employees are present, present-eism, they're there, [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1981.82s)]
*  but they're not really at full speed or they're not there because of various health [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1986.86s)]
*  ailments, that's a problem. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1990.62s)]
*  It's why we focus so hard in the U.S. on employee and occupational health. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1991.8999999999999s)]
*  It's why we're working with the National Council of Occupational Health here with this big [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1996.2199999999998s)]
*  program. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=1999.4199999999998s)]
*  It's mission critical for the Saudis to have a workforce that is healthy because they [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2000.1399999999999s)]
*  don't have enough people to do the work. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2004.22s)]
*  And it's going to be that way, I think, for the billion people as they come into the system. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2006.22s)]
*  They're going to want to have jobs and stay in those jobs and earn money and build wealth [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2009.98s)]
*  for themselves and have a confidence for the future and therefore consume. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2013.26s)]
*  It runs the whole cycle. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2016.22s)]
*  We've never thought of health care as that. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2017.58s)]
*  Health care is always seen as a drain on the economy, right? [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2019.58s)]
*  Four trillion dollars coming out of the economy as opposed to generating a lot of value for [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2021.98s)]
*  the nations that have high quality health care. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2027.34s)]
*  So keeping clean water, avoiding communicable diseases, making sure that you've got folks [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2029.42s)]
*  that are able to get basic preventive care so they all can live with a health span that [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2033.74s)]
*  the way they want to live until they're at least 85 is something that's valuable. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2039.26s)]
*  But I do have aspirations that will go a bit higher than that. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2042.38s)]
*  I think 120, which you've mentioned, maybe longer. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2045.18s)]
*  But think of how much value there is to someone who's 75 years old, who's learned all that, [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2047.74s)]
*  who can offer back because they've been kept healthy. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2052.7000000000003s)]
*  The only way to keep the system honest is a smarter, arbitrary, and AI is the only thing [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2054.62s)]
*  in my lifetime that's sitting close to doing that. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2058.78s)]
*  So it's going to allow all these transformations to happen. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2061.02s)]
*  And without AI, and there's a lot of arguments about the good or the bad, AI is not going [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2064.0600000000004s)]
*  to be the problem. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2067.98s)]
*  It's people who use AI who aren't good. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2068.6200000000003s)]
*  I'm going to, we're out of time, but I'm going to do a survey of the four of you real quick. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2070.78s)]
*  Here's the question. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2074.7000000000003s)]
*  When will it be malpractice to diagnose a patient without AI in the loop? [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2076.38s)]
*  Your answer within five years, within 10 years, within 20 years, or never? [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2082.2200000000003s)]
*  I'm going to start with you. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2087.26s)]
*  I would say within five years. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2088.78s)]
*  Within five years. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2089.98s)]
*  One year. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2090.94s)]
*  Within one year. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2091.6600000000003s)]
*  Within one year to be some of these complicated diagnoses. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2092.7000000000003s)]
*  Why would you not just search it? [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2095.6600000000003s)]
*  It's right there. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2097.02s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2097.82s)]
*  Jim? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2098.38s)]
*  I would say less than five for sure. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2098.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2100.86s)]
*  I would say practically within five years. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2101.7400000000002s)]
*  When the legal system evolves is a different question. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2103.98s)]
*  Peter, how would you answer it and how would you close it out? [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2106.38s)]
*  I'm going to push it hard as I can as soon as I can. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2108.6200000000003s)]
*  20 minutes? [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2111.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2111.98s)]
*  I think within five years is my answer. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2112.94s)]
*  Let's give it up for our amazing panel, everybody. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2114.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2116.86s)]
*  It's your G photo. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI8VA8aV0Vw&t=2118.78s)]
