# The World-Changing Technology Everyone Is Missing w/ Jack Hidary | EP #124
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM)
*  GPS is very brittle. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's also can be spoofed, right? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2.64s)]
*  And that's right now is what Russia's doing over Ukraine. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=4.64s)]
*  It's what Iran is doing in much of the Gulf region. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=8.08s)]
*  It's what China's doing in and around Taiwan. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=10.84s)]
*  So how does quantum sensing solve this problem? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=14.08s)]
*  Here's the bad news. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=16.04s)]
*  We now have devices in clinical trial [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=17.0s)]
*  that allow us to pick up the magnetic field of a heart. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=19.44s)]
*  This device is able to detect [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=22.88s)]
*  what's going on in under five minutes. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=24.76s)]
*  That's extraordinary. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=26.96s)]
*  Can you make money with quantum technologies? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=28.0s)]
*  We spun out about two and a half years ago, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=30.64s)]
*  raised around the 500 million using LQMs, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=33.0s)]
*  large quantitative models, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=36.4s)]
*  combining that with quantum technologies. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=37.76s)]
*  This is a recipe for great, great success. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  Welcome to Moonshots, part two with Jack Hittery. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=47.8s)]
*  Today we're gonna talk about quantum applications. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=50.64s)]
*  Can you make money with quantum technologies? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=53.24s)]
*  Not just quantum computing, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=55.92s)]
*  quantum technologies backed by popular demand, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=56.88s)]
*  the incredible CEO of Sandbox AQ, Jack Hittery. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=59.88s)]
*  Jack, good to see you, buddy. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=64.4s)]
*  Peter, good to see you. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  Last time we spoke, we had quite the conversation [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=67.52s)]
*  about sort of the fundamentals of quantum [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=70.2s)]
*  and how we can now simulate in silico, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=74.0s)]
*  in classical computers, quantum equations [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=77.0s)]
*  that allow us to understand the world of atoms [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  and molecules and ions versus the world of bits. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=83.76s)]
*  And what you've built at Sandbox AQ [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=88.52000000000001s)]
*  is nothing less than a rocket ship [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=92.64s)]
*  that's actually making money today. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=96.28s)]
*  So, I mean, people have asked, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=98.84s)]
*  is quantum, the world of quantum decades away? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  And is it something that is actual business? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=104.08000000000001s)]
*  And you've turned it into a business. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=107.2s)]
*  So let's jump in there. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=108.92s)]
*  Sure, yeah. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=110.68s)]
*  What we realize is that if we marry quantum technologies, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=111.52s)]
*  quantum approaches with AI, specifically quantitative AI, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=116.0s)]
*  then we can actually build products for today. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=122.0s)]
*  We can actually deliver value today to real customers, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  global 1,000 customers all around the world. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=127.32s)]
*  Let's go through some examples, Peter. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=130.72s)]
*  And just for reference here, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=132.72s)]
*  you built Sandbox AQ out of alphabet. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=136.76s)]
*  It was spun out of alphabet with support of Sergey Brin. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=140.88s)]
*  Eric Schmidt is your chairman. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=143.84s)]
*  And out of the box, you raised a half a billion dollars, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=145.64s)]
*  which is an amazing seed round. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=148.92s)]
*  I mean, very few people in the world [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=150.4s)]
*  have half a billion dollar seed round. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  And you're making revenue today. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=154.04s)]
*  I don't know if you're able to sort of quantify that [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=155.4s)]
*  for two years out of the gate, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=158.88s)]
*  just to give people a sense of this being a real business [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=161.44s)]
*  and then jumping into your different products. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=164.12s)]
*  Sure, Peter, exactly right. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=166.4s)]
*  We spun out about two and a half years ago, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=168.28s)]
*  raised around to 500 million. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=171.48000000000002s)]
*  And just fast forward two and a half years later, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=173.20000000000002s)]
*  we built actually a very robust business [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=176.6s)]
*  with lots of really big customers, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=178.6s)]
*  customers in the pharma space, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=181.04000000000002s)]
*  customers in the aerospace sector, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=182.52s)]
*  customers in energy and batteries, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=185.48000000000002s)]
*  really big sectors of our society. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=188.72s)]
*  So what you see is that when you look at [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=190.76000000000002s)]
*  quantitative approaches using LQMs, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=193.0s)]
*  large quantitative models, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=196.8s)]
*  combining that with quantum technologies, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=198.16s)]
*  this is a recipe for great, great success. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=200.84s)]
*  So let's go through some examples. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=203.56s)]
*  Let's take quantum sensors. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=205.04s)]
*  Quantum sensors are here today. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=206.76s)]
*  Last time we talked about, Peter, you and I, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=209.84s)]
*  quantum computers. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=211.72s)]
*  Quantum computers are being built right now [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  by about three dozen very serious outfits, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=215.12s)]
*  both large companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google, IBM, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  as well as startups such as PsyQuantum, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  IonQ and many others. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=225.76s)]
*  Very exciting to see that. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=227.56s)]
*  And in a number of years, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=228.96s)]
*  we'll have scaled fault tolerant quantum computers, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=231.52s)]
*  but that's not yet today. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=234.4s)]
*  But let's now turn to quantum sensors. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=236.24s)]
*  Quantum sensors are here right now. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=238.56s)]
*  These are sensors that go beyond [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=240.84s)]
*  our previous classical ability [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=243.2s)]
*  to sense the world around us. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=245.16s)]
*  Let's take an example of the magnetic field around us. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=246.32s)]
*  Our earth has a magnetic field. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=250.48000000000002s)]
*  It's not very strong, but it's got a magnetic field. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=253.24s)]
*  And thank God it does, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=255.76s)]
*  because without it, we'd all be fried to a crisp. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=256.8s)]
*  Yeah, cosmic rays suck. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=261.2s)]
*  Yeah, the magnetic field protects us [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  from all kinds of harmful radiation that hits our earth. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=266.36s)]
*  And those planets that lost their magnetic field [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=271.92s)]
*  or do not have one are not as habitable as ours. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=276.48s)]
*  And one of the beautiful things about earth [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=280.36s)]
*  is this magnetic field. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=282.68s)]
*  Have you ever seen that? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=283.72s)]
*  The animations, when you look at earth from space [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=285.32000000000005s)]
*  and you see how it's protecting us [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=288.04s)]
*  from various radiation, it's a wonderful, wonderful thing. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=291.16s)]
*  But we can also use that magnetic field [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  in a variety of ways. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=297.76000000000005s)]
*  We can navigate. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=299.28000000000003s)]
*  Now, all of us as kids probably had a compass. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=300.12s)]
*  That compass pointed north, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=302.44000000000005s)]
*  and we would be in the woods [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=304.16s)]
*  and hopefully find our way out of the woods [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=306.24s)]
*  with that little compass. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=308.04s)]
*  Well, we can go beyond that now. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=309.6s)]
*  In fact, a good chunk of the animal kingdom [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=310.96000000000004s)]
*  uses the magnetic field every single day. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=314.35999999999996s)]
*  When we look at the millions and millions of birds [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=316.4s)]
*  around our planet, we see them migrating [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=318.79999999999995s)]
*  north to south, south to north. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=321.0s)]
*  In fact, I had the opportunity to see the Arctic tern. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=323.08s)]
*  The Arctic tern is an amazing bird. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=326.84s)]
*  It's a white bird that travels 24,000 kilometers a year [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=328.68s)]
*  because it goes from the North Pole to the South Pole. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=334.68s)]
*  I have beautiful photos of you [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=337.52s)]
*  in your big winter gear down in the South Pole. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=339.48s)]
*  Yes, I was, I wasn't in South Pole yet, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=343.6s)]
*  but I was in Antarctica. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=345.48s)]
*  I was in Antarctica and I had the opportunity [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=346.88s)]
*  to see the Arctic tern there. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=348.56s)]
*  And then more recently, I was in Svalbard, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=349.68s)]
*  which is north of the Arctic Circle. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=352.0s)]
*  It's one of the only pieces of land [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=353.76s)]
*  that you could step on north of the Arctic Circle. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=355.04s)]
*  And I saw an Arctic tern there on its way up. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=358.2s)]
*  And so that was just, I really appreciated the ability [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=361.4s)]
*  to see the Arctic tern in both places. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=366.24s)]
*  But how did it do it? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=368.28s)]
*  How does the Arctic tern travel these thousands [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=369.64s)]
*  of kilometers off and over water? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=373.52s)]
*  Well, one of the things that it's able to do, of course, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=375.88s)]
*  is to pick up the magnetic field of the earth. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=378.28s)]
*  And many, many birds have that ability. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=382.0s)]
*  It's not just birds. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=384.67999999999995s)]
*  When we look at certain kinds of whales, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=385.91999999999996s)]
*  many species of whales are able to do that. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=388.15999999999997s)]
*  And they travel thousands of kilometers underwater [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=389.84s)]
*  to go from feeding places to their place [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=393.08s)]
*  where they give birth to the next cohort, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=396.12s)]
*  the next generation. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=398.44s)]
*  And so we see many, many kinds of animals out there. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=399.76s)]
*  Dogs actually have some ability here, as well as do turtles. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=402.72s)]
*  When you see those turtles scurrying towards the water, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=406.16s)]
*  they're not actually picking up some scent of the water [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=410.72s)]
*  or something like that. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=412.76s)]
*  It's actually using magnetic fields as well. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=413.6s)]
*  So a lot of the animal kingdom does that. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=416.88s)]
*  We humans have lost that ability innately to do so. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=419.68s)]
*  So we need to use technology. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=422.44s)]
*  And the good news is that's what Sandbox AQ has just done. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=424.28s)]
*  Starting about five years ago, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=428.55999999999995s)]
*  we realized that GPS is very brittle. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=429.91999999999996s)]
*  GPS is a series of satellites, of course, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=433.44s)]
*  is now for GPS systems around the world. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=435.71999999999997s)]
*  US has launched one many years ago. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=438.59999999999997s)]
*  Europe has one, Russia has one, and China has one. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=440.96s)]
*  Russia and China realized [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=444.52s)]
*  that they needed their own EPS system [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=446.44s)]
*  in case that we turned off ours against them. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=450.79999999999995s)]
*  And so they have their own. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=453.76s)]
*  US and Europe have them. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=456.15999999999997s)]
*  But unfortunately, the GPS signal is very easy to jam. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=457.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's also can be spoofed, right? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=460.8s)]
*  I mean, you can create false GPS signals [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=462.76s)]
*  and lead someone to the exact wrong direction. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=465.68s)]
*  That's right. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=468.88s)]
*  And that's happening right now. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=469.71999999999997s)]
*  Various adversaries are spoofing GPS. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=470.53999999999996s)]
*  If you want to jam GPS, you can literally go online. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=474.03999999999996s)]
*  It's not legal, so please don't do it. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=476.76s)]
*  But if you go online, you can find little boxes. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=478.32s)]
*  They look like large walkie talkies, essentially. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=481.36s)]
*  And you can jam GPS for your entire neighborhood. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=484.16s)]
*  And if you have a bigger one, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=487.32s)]
*  you can jam it over a whole city. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=488.52000000000004s)]
*  And that's right now is what Russia's doing over Ukraine. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=490.16s)]
*  It's what Iran is doing in much of the Gulf region. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=493.56s)]
*  It's what China's doing in and around Taiwan. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=496.32s)]
*  It's happening right now. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=499.64s)]
*  This was Frontpage, Wall Street Journal, just two weeks ago. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=500.76s)]
*  Literally the digital Frontpage [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=505.2s)]
*  and the physical Frontpage was this issue. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=506.88s)]
*  It impacts both defense, national security, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=511.56s)]
*  as well as the civilian aerospace. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=514.44s)]
*  Thousands of flights since the beginning of this year [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=517.0s)]
*  have been disrupted. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=519.24s)]
*  Some have had to land other places. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=520.4s)]
*  Finnair, as an example, one of the Scandinavian airlines [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=522.32s)]
*  has had to cut routes to the Baltic regions [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=526.4s)]
*  because it simply cannot get their planes there. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=529.48s)]
*  They cannot get the planes due to lack of GPS. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=531.76s)]
*  And that's on jamming and spoofing, Peter. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=535.4s)]
*  And of course, we know, we know, this is public info, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=537.16s)]
*  China and Russia have both announced capability [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=540.6s)]
*  to take satellites out, to take them out of the sky. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=542.64s)]
*  Unfortunately, so we built an amazing dependency on GPS. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=546.44s)]
*  And of course, the other thing is GPS doesn't work underwater [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=551.24s)]
*  where the signal gets attenuated very quickly [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=555.24s)]
*  with like, you know, just a tiny amount of water. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=558.48s)]
*  Peter underwater, bingo. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=561.0400000000001s)]
*  So underwater is an issue as well, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=563.32s)]
*  as well as also underneath in tunnels. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=565.52s)]
*  And if you're doing, you know, you're in caves [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=568.16s)]
*  or you're looking for different minerals under the earth, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=571.3199999999999s)]
*  again, no GPS to be had there. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=575.28s)]
*  So how does quantum sensing solve this problem? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=577.88s)]
*  So what do we do? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=579.88s)]
*  We realize that, okay, we've got finally mapping of the world [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=580.7199999999999s)]
*  from the magnetic map point of view. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=584.76s)]
*  Various satellites have been sent up over the past two decades [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=586.4s)]
*  to actually map this field. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=590.28s)]
*  And it turns out we have the core field of the earth [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=592.88s)]
*  and that is a magnetic field that is a result [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=596.48s)]
*  of the molten iron that's moving around [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=598.36s)]
*  around the core iron ball in the center of our earth. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=600.8000000000001s)]
*  And that creates a homogenous field. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=605.12s)]
*  So you can't really navigate with that [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=607.5600000000001s)]
*  because it's the same in all directions. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=609.2800000000001s)]
*  It's too broad, yeah. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=611.6400000000001s)]
*  It's a spherical field, it's the same in all directions. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=613.48s)]
*  But here's what happens. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=615.72s)]
*  As that field moves through our crust, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=617.08s)]
*  our crust has various minerals in it. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=620.44s)]
*  And it has a number of minerals that are ferromagnetic. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=623.12s)]
*  Ferromagnetic means that they're not themselves [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=627.44s)]
*  innately magnetic, but they can be magnetized, right? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=629.8s)]
*  Just like a paperclip. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=632.6s)]
*  Iron, nickel, cobalt, all kinds of things. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=633.5600000000001s)]
*  And so magnetite, hematite, these are two of the minerals [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=636.48s)]
*  that we find randomly distributed in our crust. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=640.16s)]
*  And that random distribution is very helpful [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=643.16s)]
*  because it warps the core field into a local signature. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=645.48s)]
*  And so when you actually pass over the earth, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=651.48s)]
*  you can see different distributions. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=655.16s)]
*  And now that we've mapped it, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=657.0s)]
*  we can navigate with the crustal field. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=658.6s)]
*  So this is like a magnetic fingerprint of a region. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=661.6s)]
*  And is it really of high enough fidelity for me to know [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=666.16s)]
*  where I am on my, here in Santa Monica, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=669.76s)]
*  or in a sub off the coast of Kalamata, Greece? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=673.52s)]
*  I mean, it's that level of fidelity. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=678.24s)]
*  You just let the viewers know, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=682.08s)]
*  Peter right now is in a submarine off the coast of Greece. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=683.76s)]
*  It's wonderful technology. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=687.96s)]
*  Great to see you, Peter. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=689.2800000000001s)]
*  But in fact, it is, it is ability. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=692.88s)]
*  So just like if you go back to Google Earth [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=694.8000000000001s)]
*  and Google Street View, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=696.96s)]
*  when Google Earth first launched more than a decade ago, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=698.32s)]
*  it was a bit rough around the edges. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=702.08s)]
*  The resolution wasn't great in all areas. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=703.8000000000001s)]
*  And then over time, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=706.16s)]
*  Google filled in these spaces [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=707.64s)]
*  with higher and higher resolution images, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=709.92s)]
*  ultimately getting down to Street View. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=711.8s)]
*  And now even they had sent people into inside museums [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=713.7199999999999s)]
*  and you can now navigate inside a museum. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=717.4s)]
*  And that's what will happen [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=720.0s)]
*  with magnetic field maps of our earth. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=721.24s)]
*  We have very, very good maps today [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=723.64s)]
*  because of many satellites that have taken [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=725.3199999999999s)]
*  these magnetic images over a two decade period. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=727.0799999999999s)]
*  But of course, if people have an area of interest, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=731.04s)]
*  they can drag a magnetometer, a magnetic sensor [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=733.76s)]
*  over that area of interest and get even higher resolution. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=736.92s)]
*  We'll see that happening over the coming years. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=739.96s)]
*  But back to the main story. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=742.28s)]
*  So given this magnetic map and given a sensor, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=745.12s)]
*  a quantum sensor, you can actually detect [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=748.4399999999999s)]
*  where that magnetic field is and how it's looking [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=751.28s)]
*  square meter by square meter by square meter. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=754.2s)]
*  Today, we don't have to go down to the square meter level [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=756.88s)]
*  to help a plane navigate, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=759.2s)]
*  but ultimately that will be the resolution [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=761.84s)]
*  that people start to. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=764.36s)]
*  So you've got a box in your airplane, in your sub, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=765.52s)]
*  in your car, and it's picking up the variations of the field [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=768.48s)]
*  and it's creating this pattern over time [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=772.0400000000001s)]
*  and then you're matching that pattern. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=774.76s)]
*  That's right. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=776.4s)]
*  And this is a quantum sensor. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=777.24s)]
*  What it means when we say quantum sensor, what do we mean? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=778.08s)]
*  We mean that it's actually using a quantum effect. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=779.96s)]
*  So in the case of some of these sensors, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=784.84s)]
*  they're called optically pumped magnetometry. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=788.32s)]
*  That means that you have an element in there. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=790.76s)]
*  That element has various electrons [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=793.48s)]
*  and then you pump in optical energy, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=796.16s)]
*  which is photons essentially, into the electron. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=800.4399999999999s)]
*  The electron absorbs the photon. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=803.24s)]
*  The electron now moves to the higher quantum state. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=805.6s)]
*  As we know, the core idea of quantum, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=808.16s)]
*  what does quantum mean in the first place? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=810.36s)]
*  To quantize something means to make it move in discrete ways. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=812.4s)]
*  That is, if you think about a ramp versus a ladder, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=816.3199999999999s)]
*  a ramp is the kind of thing that you can go up and down on [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=819.88s)]
*  and you could stand on any part. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=822.8000000000001s)]
*  There's no distinction between, you know, you go here, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=826.8000000000001s)]
*  then go here, then here, then here. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=829.0400000000001s)]
*  You could stand anywhere you want to [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=830.72s)]
*  on that particular ramp. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=833.6800000000001s)]
*  A ladder though, is something that you're either on [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=836.24s)]
*  wrong one, wrong two, wrong three, wrong four. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=838.0s)]
*  Very discrete ties in terms of where you are on that ladder. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=840.72s)]
*  To give you another analogy in music, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=844.4000000000001s)]
*  if I have a violin or a guitar, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=846.6800000000001s)]
*  I could put my fingers anywhere I want to [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=849.64s)]
*  along that violin string, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=852.1999999999999s)]
*  and I could then have a different frequency [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=855.92s)]
*  that is played once I draw the bow. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=858.76s)]
*  A piano, on the other hand, is discretized, right? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=861.24s)]
*  You'd say a piano is like what quantum is, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=864.1999999999999s)]
*  whereas a violin is like what the classical world is. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=866.76s)]
*  You can analog move anywhere you want to. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=870.4399999999999s)]
*  The same thing with the ladder. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=873.76s)]
*  The ladder is like quantum. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=874.92s)]
*  The electron could only exist at certain rungs [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=876.64s)]
*  of energy, cannot exist in between those rungs. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=879.92s)]
*  And the ramp is more like how we understood [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=882.68s)]
*  the classical world, where the billion ball can exist [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=884.52s)]
*  anywhere we want to on the Billion Table. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=886.76s)]
*  Everybody, I want to take a short break from our episode [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=888.68s)]
*  to talk about a company that's very important to me, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=890.5999999999999s)]
*  and could actually save your life [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=893.68s)]
*  or the life of someone that you love. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=895.88s)]
*  Company is called Fountain Life, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=897.52s)]
*  and it's a company I started years ago with Tony Robbins [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=899.56s)]
*  and a group of very talented physicians. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=902.7199999999999s)]
*  You know, most of us don't actually know [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=905.24s)]
*  what's going on inside our body. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=907.28s)]
*  We're all optimists. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=909.56s)]
*  Until that day where you have a pain in your side, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=911.1999999999999s)]
*  you go to the physician in the emergency room [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=914.0s)]
*  and they say, listen, I'm sorry to tell you this, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=915.92s)]
*  but you have this stage three or four going on. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=917.72s)]
*  And you know, it didn't start that morning. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=920.9599999999999s)]
*  It probably was a problem that's been going on [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=923.88s)]
*  for some time, but because we never look, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=926.28s)]
*  we don't find out. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=929.4s)]
*  So what we built at Fountain Life [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=930.92s)]
*  was the world's most advanced diagnostic centers. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=933.28s)]
*  We have four across the US today, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=936.44s)]
*  and we're building 20 around the world. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=938.8000000000001s)]
*  These centers give you a full body MRI, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=941.0400000000001s)]
*  a brain, a brain vasculature, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=943.96s)]
*  an AI enabled coronary CT looking for soft plaque, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=946.0s)]
*  a DEXA scan, a grail blood cancer test, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=949.12s)]
*  a full executive blood workup. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=952.44s)]
*  It's the most advanced workup you'll ever receive. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=954.5600000000001s)]
*  150 gigabytes of data that then go to our AIs [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=958.0s)]
*  and our physicians to find any disease [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=961.6400000000001s)]
*  at the very beginning when it's solvable. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=964.88s)]
*  You're gonna find out eventually. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=967.88s)]
*  You might as well find out when you can take action. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=969.76s)]
*  Fountain Life also has an entire side of therapeutics. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=972.0s)]
*  We look around the world for the most advanced therapeutics [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=975.04s)]
*  that can add 10, 20 healthy years to your life, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=977.4399999999999s)]
*  and we provide them to you at our centers. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=980.16s)]
*  So if this is of interest to you, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=983.8s)]

*  When Tony and I wrote our New York Times bestseller, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=992.68s)]
*  Life Force, we had 30,000 people reached out to us [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=995.52s)]

*  we'll put you to the top of the list. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1003.96s)]
*  Really it's something that is, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1006.6s)]
*  for me, one of the most important things [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1009.08s)]
*  I offer my entire family, the CEOs of my companies, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1010.72s)]

*  onto our healthy lifespans. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1018.08s)]
*  Go to fountainlife.com backslash Peter. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1020.92s)]
*  It's one of the most important things I can offer to you [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1023.5999999999999s)]
*  as one of my listeners. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1026.32s)]
*  All right, let's go back to our episode. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1027.44s)]
*  So I brought a group of XPRIZE benefactors [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1029.1599999999999s)]
*  on a deep tech journey to the Valley. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1032.0s)]
*  We came to Sandbox AQ. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1034.8s)]
*  Yes, you can go out to the labs, yes. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1036.68s)]
*  Yes, and it's beautiful, and we saw this tech. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1038.52s)]
*  And it is a manageable size, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1042.1599999999999s)]
*  I will call it a black box, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1046.6399999999999s)]
*  but the sensors themselves are relatively small. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1047.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1053.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it's a silver box, but yes, it's relatively small. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1053.92s)]
*  And most of that box has air in it. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1058.8000000000002s)]
*  So ultimately we'll bring it down [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1060.92s)]
*  to much smaller form factors, Peter, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1064.18s)]
*  as you may have heard during the visit, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1065.8400000000001s)]
*  but the Air Force wanted a certain form factor [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1068.5600000000002s)]
*  for the testing that we've done over the last two years. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1071.76s)]
*  And the Air Force has indeed publicly tested it. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1076.3600000000001s)]
*  We'll get to that in one minute. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1078.3600000000001s)]
*  But now is the question. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1079.5200000000002s)]
*  Now you've got a great quantum sensor. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1080.88s)]
*  You're pumping this electron up. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1082.72s)]
*  And now, of course, after you stop pumping it up [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1084.92s)]
*  with photons, it comes back down and it releases a photon. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1087.44s)]
*  Conservation of energy, it absorbed the photon. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1091.5200000000002s)]
*  Now it's got to release a photon. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1094.1000000000001s)]
*  When a photon is released under a magnetic field, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1095.92s)]
*  we have something called the Zeeman effect, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1099.48s)]
*  which allows us to backtrack, back calculate [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1101.46s)]
*  what the strength of that magnetic field is [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1104.92s)]
*  given the pathway and given the characteristics [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1107.3200000000002s)]
*  of that photon. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1110.98s)]
*  So when we detect that photon, we can see indeed [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1111.8200000000002s)]
*  there was a magnetic field of this particular strength [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1115.3200000000002s)]
*  at that particular moment. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1117.64s)]
*  And then we can use that to calculate [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1119.4s)]
*  what the pattern of magnetic field is right underneath us. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1121.44s)]
*  So let's say we're flying at 600, 700 miles an hour [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1125.5600000000002s)]
*  in a plane or on other vehicles as well. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1128.78s)]
*  Now the question is, OK, you've got a great sensor. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1132.54s)]
*  That's the good news. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1135.06s)]
*  Here's the bad news. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1135.8999999999999s)]
*  You've got a great sensor. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1136.82s)]
*  Great sensors means you have too much information. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1138.58s)]
*  That means that if, Peter, you and I are on that plane, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1140.86s)]
*  let's say we're on a C-17, it's a big, big cargo hold [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1143.82s)]
*  that we fly on with the Air Force. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1147.62s)]
*  Lots of people can be there. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1149.78s)]
*  Everyone with their cell phones, every cell phone [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1151.06s)]
*  is giving off a magnetic field. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1153.8999999999999s)]
*  Every watch is giving off a magnetic field. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1155.54s)]
*  Every heartbeat, as we'll learn in a few minutes. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1158.78s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1161.3s)]
*  Everything is giving off magnetic fields. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1161.86s)]
*  So it's a very noisy environment. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1163.62s)]
*  If you had to physically try to shield all that out, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1165.2199999999998s)]
*  that would be very, very difficult. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1169.4199999999998s)]
*  And so you need an AI now, a quantitative AI, an AI that [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1171.4199999999998s)]
*  doesn't think about words. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1175.1s)]
*  This is not a chat 2PT. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1177.02s)]
*  This is an AI that thinks about numbers. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1179.06s)]
*  And these numbers are the strengths from moment [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1181.3799999999999s)]
*  to moment of the magnetic fields below it and then around it. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1184.5s)]
*  And what we've done over the years [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1189.38s)]
*  is train an AI successfully to look [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1191.1000000000001s)]
*  at the magnetic field of the Earth, interpret that, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1194.3400000000001s)]
*  but ignore the magnetic field around it. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1196.7s)]
*  That's extraordinary. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1199.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1200.3000000000002s)]
*  That's what the hardest part was. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1201.3000000000002s)]
*  The hardest part actually wasn't the quantum side. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1203.3400000000001s)]
*  It was the AI side. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1206.22s)]
*  And so that's why we call it AQNAV. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1208.5800000000002s)]
*  It's AI and quantum coming together [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1210.8600000000001s)]
*  to create a navigational platform. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1213.7800000000002s)]
*  And this platform, Peter, cannot be jammed or spoofed. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1216.14s)]
*  It is air-gapped. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1219.02s)]
*  There is no way to connect to it. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1220.1399999999999s)]
*  It's not on the internet. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1221.42s)]
*  It doesn't communicate with any satellites. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1222.54s)]
*  It doesn't need any satellites. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1224.46s)]
*  It doesn't communicate with any radio frequencies. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1225.98s)]
*  It's simply listening to the Earth. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1229.1399999999999s)]
*  It's one way, listening to the Earth [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1231.5s)]
*  and understanding the way that birds do, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1233.82s)]
*  understanding the field right below it, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1236.98s)]
*  and navigating with that. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1238.9s)]
*  And what we've shown, and the Air Force announced this [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1240.42s)]
*  so I can talk about it publicly, is that indeed, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1243.34s)]
*  this AQNAV in combination with inertial navigation systems, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1247.58s)]
*  INS, as we all know, I think on this podcast. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1252.54s)]
*  IMUs, inertial measurement units, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1256.62s)]
*  that are tracking their movement directionally [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1258.4199999999998s)]
*  and accelerationally. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1260.6999999999998s)]
*  With gyroscopes. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1261.54s)]
*  Moment to moment, as with gyroscopes. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1262.3799999999999s)]
*  From the earliest days of the Apollo missions to today, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1264.1s)]
*  flying, there are gyroscopes in planes [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1267.62s)]
*  and in rockets as well. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1271.02s)]
*  And we all recall pulling that string of a gyroscope [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1272.46s)]
*  and how it precesses, it moves in its ways, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1275.98s)]
*  and you could hold it this way, you could hold it that way, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1278.74s)]
*  you can hold it this way. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1281.14s)]
*  It's always doing its thing. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1282.26s)]
*  That's the principle we use in INSs, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1283.9s)]
*  in inertial navigation systems. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1286.94s)]
*  IMUs are an example of that. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1288.46s)]
*  And so the INS is wonderful. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1290.42s)]
*  The problem is drift. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1292.38s)]
*  After just 10 minutes flying at 700 miles an hour, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1294.5800000000002s)]
*  you have drifted significantly. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1297.66s)]
*  And after an hour or two or three, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1300.02s)]
*  and that's what's happening to these planes now, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1302.3400000000001s)]
*  they're inside GPS denied areas for hours on end, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1304.22s)]
*  they're not gonna get back to where they need to, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1308.34s)]
*  nor will they reach there. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1311.98s)]
*  Though it is amazing that Charles Lindbergh, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1313.42s)]
*  with nothing less than a rough map, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1315.8600000000001s)]
*  made it from New York to Le Brej, but we won't go there. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1318.14s)]
*  So we've got NAV AQ up, or AQNAV up and running. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1322.3s)]
*  I wanna move the conversation, if we could, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1328.18s)]
*  to another quantum sensor in the magnetic field space, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1331.38s)]
*  which is what you're doing in the field of medicine, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1335.8600000000001s)]
*  which a lot of folks are sincerely interested in. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1337.7800000000002s)]
*  Would you go there? [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1340.42s)]
*  Sure. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1341.7800000000002s)]
*  So the same principle of detecting the magnetic fields [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1342.6200000000001s)]
*  and having an AI that could read the sensor, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1345.5400000000002s)]
*  look at the signal and ignore the noise, right? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1348.38s)]
*  That's the critical signal to noise ratio [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1351.1000000000001s)]
*  that we always talk about. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1353.3000000000002s)]
*  We can bring this right back to earth in hospitals, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1354.66s)]
*  in clinics, at the bedside, in ambulances, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1358.06s)]
*  and in preventative, and also even in sports [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1361.62s)]
*  and performance medicine, we can bring it [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1363.82s)]
*  to one of the key medical challenges of our time, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1366.18s)]
*  which is cardiac care. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1369.94s)]
*  As we all know, Peter, I think all our listeners know here, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1371.78s)]
*  heart attacks, cardiac disease, generally speaking, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1375.78s)]
*  is the number one killer in the United States. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1378.18s)]
*  For both men and women, for both men and women, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1380.3799999999999s)]
*  just to be clear, this is not a male-focused disease. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1383.46s)]
*  That's right, it's absolutely both for men and women. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1387.26s)]
*  And what's absolutely clear is that around the world, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1389.34s)]
*  it is the leading killer. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1393.9s)]
*  It is a silent killer very often, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1396.26s)]
*  coming out with almost no warning signs, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1398.14s)]
*  well ahead of time. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1401.54s)]
*  And we know that our current diagnostic tools fall short. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1402.66s)]
*  How many times do we know in our experiences [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1405.9s)]
*  with friends, family, colleagues, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1410.74s)]
*  that unfortunately we hear about somebody [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1412.78s)]
*  that had a great physical, was given an A plus [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1414.46s)]
*  in their physical three months later, heart attack? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1418.6200000000001s)]
*  Can I double down on this? [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1421.22s)]
*  The numbers which I know are 70% of all heart attacks [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1422.8600000000001s)]
*  have no precedence, no symptoms, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1426.3s)]
*  no shortness of breath, no pain. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1428.6200000000001s)]
*  In fact, you can have a zero calcium score [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1430.6200000000001s)]
*  where your calcified plaque is actually [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1434.66s)]
*  sort of like cement on the side of the arteries. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1437.5s)]
*  If it isn't blocking your coronary artery, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1439.1000000000001s)]
*  denying the heart tissue oxygen, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1441.5s)]
*  if it's stable, it's fine. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1444.42s)]
*  It is the inflammatory, the soft plaque that can, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1445.98s)]
*  EVOLSE can break out in the middle of the night [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1450.54s)]
*  and block the supply of blood and oxygen glucose [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1453.74s)]
*  to the heart and give you a heart attack. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1457.54s)]
*  So does your AQ med help detect that? [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1459.82s)]
*  So here's what happened. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1464.62s)]
*  We realized that the magnetic field [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1466.26s)]
*  is something that we can now detect, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1469.02s)]
*  not just of the earth, like we just discussed, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1470.38s)]
*  but also of the body. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1472.18s)]
*  And it turns out that every time you have electricity, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1473.7s)]
*  what Faraday, what Michael Faraday taught us [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1475.74s)]
*  back in the 1800s is that every time you have [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1478.42s)]
*  an electric field, you have a magnetic field. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1480.8600000000001s)]
*  That's how it works. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1483.6200000000001s)]
*  And so we know that we have electric pulses in our heart. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1485.3000000000002s)]
*  Most of us still have our natural electric pulses. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1488.7800000000002s)]
*  Those who lose that capability, of course, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1491.5400000000002s)]
*  have a pacemaker and a pacemaker artificially [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1493.18s)]
*  makes that happen. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1497.0200000000002s)]
*  But talking about the heart, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1498.02s)]
*  we have these signals that go in. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1500.82s)]
*  Why do we have this electric signal? [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1503.02s)]
*  So that we can contract the heart. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1504.3799999999999s)]
*  The heart is a muscle, like any muscle in our body, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1506.1399999999999s)]
*  it contracts. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1509.1s)]
*  When it contracts, of course, it's spurting the blood out [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1510.06s)]
*  and we go around and hopefully people are also thinking [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1512.74s)]
*  about their second heart. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1515.78s)]
*  Their second heart are our calf muscles. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1517.1s)]
*  I hope people are working out their calf muscles [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1518.98s)]
*  because we need those muscles to get that blood back up. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1520.9s)]
*  So please work out your calf muscles [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1524.3799999999999s)]
*  to get that blood back up from not pooling in your- [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1526.3799999999999s)]
*  You're a Venus return. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1529.58s)]
*  You're a Venus return. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1530.9399999999998s)]
*  So we have muscles in our body. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1532.5s)]
*  When I'm moving my finger right now, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1534.62s)]
*  my brain is sending a signal to this muscle to contract. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1536.5s)]
*  That's an- [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1540.34s)]
*  Actually the muscle is down here, but that's okay. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1541.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I'm saying, but it's sending muscle here [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1543.54s)]
*  to contract over here. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1545.3799999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1546.22s)]
*  And so what we can do is we can pick up [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1547.4199999999998s)]
*  with the magnetic field associated [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1550.86s)]
*  with the electricity of the heart. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1553.26s)]
*  And in fact, we can go beyond ECG, EKG. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1555.62s)]
*  ECG as it's called in most of the world, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1558.9399999999998s)]
*  EKG is what we call it in America, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1561.3s)]
*  in the United States is electrocardiography. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1563.58s)]
*  And as you well know, this is really a very indirect [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1565.62s)]
*  kind of way of looking at the heart. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1570.54s)]
*  What are we looking at? [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1571.5s)]
*  We're putting pads with wires on people's chest. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1572.34s)]
*  We're looking at skin conductance, okay? [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1575.6999999999998s)]
*  Right? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1579.54s)]
*  So skin conductance, but now we're really interested [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1580.3799999999999s)]
*  in an organ that is inside the body cavity [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1582.8999999999999s)]
*  beyond bone and tissue of the skin, beyond that. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1586.1s)]
*  And in fact, it is a very poor indicator [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1590.1799999999998s)]
*  of exactly what's going on inside the heart. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1592.86s)]
*  You can tell some things of course, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1594.9399999999998s)]
*  and actually I have a glass right here, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1597.3s)]
*  I hope people can see it, but it has all the EKG symbols, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1599.1399999999999s)]
*  the various waveforms on it. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1603.3s)]
*  And it tells you about NSRs and tachycardia, bradycardia, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1605.1s)]
*  PPVC, aflutter, afib, STEMI. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1609.1799999999998s)]
*  So I always keep this near me. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1612.18s)]
*  And that's the PQRS complex. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1613.46s)]
*  Yes, in case I have to interpret it, EKG at any moment. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1615.8200000000002s)]
*  But in fact, there's a form of heart attack [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1621.18s)]
*  that we call NSTEMI. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1624.78s)]
*  What does NSTEMI mean? [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1626.3s)]
*  Well, STEMI is ST, elevated myocardial infarction, STEMI, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1627.14s)]
*  and the S and T, we give letters to, as you know, Peter, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1632.5s)]
*  to the various parts of the waveform. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1635.1000000000001s)]
*  And so a STEMI heart attack, we can see on an ECG, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1636.94s)]
*  but NSTEMI, by definition, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1639.94s)]
*  non-ST elevated myocardial infarction, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1642.18s)]
*  we cannot see on the EKG because there is no elevation. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1645.66s)]
*  There's no elevation of the waveform. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1649.74s)]
*  So what do we do? [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1651.8600000000001s)]
*  Well, it turns out years ago, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1652.8600000000001s)]
*  people realized that the magnetic field of the heart [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1653.94s)]
*  is richer in information. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1656.42s)]
*  It comes out intact, just like you talked about Peter, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1657.94s)]
*  during our AQNAV conversation, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1661.46s)]
*  that the magnetic field goes through the oceans. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1663.3400000000001s)]
*  We can detect it underwater, above water, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1666.14s)]
*  here, there, in the earth, above the earth, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1668.46s)]
*  inside the earth, it is everywhere. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1670.7s)]
*  The same thing with our heart's magnetic field as well. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1673.46s)]
*  And so if we can pick up the magnetic field of the heart, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1676.8600000000001s)]
*  we can actually detect far more [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1679.38s)]
*  than the indirect skin conductance of the EKG. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1681.58s)]
*  And that's actually what's now happened. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1685.18s)]
*  At Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1687.66s)]
*  at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1689.7s)]
*  we now have devices in clinical trial, not approved yet, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1692.1000000000001s)]
*  but in clinical trial, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1695.54s)]
*  that allow us to pick up the magnetic field of the heart [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1696.98s)]
*  using these sensors. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1700.6599999999999s)]
*  But again, just like the navigation, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1701.82s)]
*  the hardest part, Peter, was not the sensing. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1703.86s)]
*  The hardest part was the quantitative AI [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1707.1s)]
*  that could find that signal and ignore the noise. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1709.94s)]
*  The hospital environment, Peter, as you all know- [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1713.06s)]
*  Oh, so noisy, so noisy. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1715.82s)]
*  Like magnetic noisy problems. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1717.34s)]
*  Here was our first problem. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1718.78s)]
*  We had our prototype out of our Palo Alto labs. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1720.02s)]
*  We're all excited. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1722.5s)]
*  First hospital we went to was UCSF Hospital, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1723.62s)]
*  wheeled it in and started taking readings [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1726.1799999999998s)]
*  and realized that the elevator shaft [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1729.54s)]
*  was 20 feet away from our device, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1731.9399999999998s)]
*  was going up and down. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1735.2199999999998s)]
*  And of course, there's electromagnetism involved [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1736.26s)]
*  in those big weights that go up and down [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1738.26s)]
*  and the magnets that they're used. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1740.5s)]
*  In an elevator to go up and down [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1742.6599999999999s)]
*  was destroying our ability to find the signal in the heart. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1745.02s)]
*  And so we literally, when people say go back to the lab, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1748.4599999999998s)]
*  we literally wheeled it back to our lab [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1751.34s)]
*  and redesigned it so that we would have more [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1753.82s)]
*  of a robust ability to look at the heart [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1756.6999999999998s)]
*  and ignore the noise. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1760.1799999999998s)]
*  In fact, that's what happened. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1762.1s)]
*  We're now on our seventh iteration of this device [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1763.86s)]
*  and I'm happy to report that the trials are going quite well [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1767.1399999999999s)]
*  with real patients in emergency rooms. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1771.02s)]
*  This is not once in a while someone stops by [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1773.22s)]
*  to kind of check this thing out. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1775.74s)]
*  This is inside an emergency room. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1777.3799999999999s)]
*  MCG, magnetocardiography. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1779.26s)]
*  That's right. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1782.5s)]
*  And so is it faster? [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1783.34s)]
*  Is it more accurate? [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1786.22s)]
*  What is it that differentiates it [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1788.02s)]
*  from what is now decades? [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1790.22s)]
*  Yeah, so gold standard today is troponin levels, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1793.02s)]
*  which as many of our listeners will know is a blood draw, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1795.78s)]
*  has to be taken to a lab inside the hospital in red. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1799.02s)]
*  And troponin levels are not specific to the heart. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1802.38s)]
*  It indicates muscle breakdown, muscle weakness, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1804.74s)]
*  but it is not specific to the heart. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1807.06s)]
*  Lots of false positives, false negatives, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1809.26s)]
*  really not the greatest thing in the world, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1811.74s)]
*  but that's what we've got today. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1813.26s)]
*  And so it often takes at least one blood draw. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1814.86s)]
*  That's a two plus hour cycle [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1817.54s)]
*  to find out what's happening with this person. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1819.94s)]
*  Eight million chest pain presentations [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1821.82s)]
*  to emergency rooms a year just in the US. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1824.02s)]
*  Only a fraction of them are having a heart attack [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1826.46s)]
*  at that moment. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1828.94s)]
*  Needs a triage very quickly to find out what's happening, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1829.86s)]
*  but it takes one blood draw. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1832.86s)]
*  In more than half the cases [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1834.46s)]
*  takes at least two troponin blood draws. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1835.98s)]
*  Now we're talking four, five, six hours [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1838.7s)]
*  after they've entered into the emergency room. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1841.3s)]
*  Not only are they not getting treated well, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1843.9s)]
*  also they're taking up resources in the ED [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1846.22s)]
*  in the emergency department, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1848.94s)]
*  and we're not treating others that need treating as well. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1850.26s)]
*  And so this device is able to detect [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1853.6200000000001s)]
*  what's going on in under five minutes. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1856.02s)]
*  Not invasive, no rays coming out of it. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1858.3400000000001s)]
*  Keep your clothes on, no wires, no crazy pads. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1860.94s)]
*  This is Star Trek technology. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1864.98s)]
*  Sort of step in, did you have a heart attack? [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1866.98s)]
*  Is your heart in good health or not? [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1869.22s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1871.46s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1872.5s)]
*  The first indication, Peter, that we're going for [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1873.3400000000001s)]
*  is this triage application. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1874.94s)]
*  Over time we'll add more capabilities to this device [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1877.02s)]
*  and to the AI, looking at AFib, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1880.7s)]
*  looking at lots of other things. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1882.5s)]
*  But initially we're going for [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1883.7800000000002s)]
*  this emergency department issue. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1885.42s)]
*  And that's why we're right now [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1887.14s)]
*  inside the Mount Sinai Hospital, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1888.9s)]
*  inside the Mayo Clinic Cardiac Hospital. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1891.1s)]
*  And that's giving us the data that we'll need [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1893.42s)]
*  to then seek approval for this device. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1895.82s)]
*  Everybody, I wanna take a short break from our episode [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1897.74s)]
*  to talk about a company that's very important to me [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1899.66s)]
*  and could actually save your life [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1902.7s)]
*  or the life of someone that you love. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1904.94s)]
*  Company is called Fountain Life. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1906.54s)]
*  And it's a company I started years ago with Tony Robbins [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1908.62s)]
*  and a group of very talented physicians. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1911.78s)]
*  Most of us don't actually know [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1914.74s)]
*  what's going on inside our body. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1916.34s)]
*  We're all optimists. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1918.58s)]
*  Until that day when you have a pain in your side, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1920.26s)]
*  you go to the physician in the emergency room [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1923.02s)]
*  and they say, listen, I'm sorry to tell you this, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1924.94s)]
*  but you have this stage three or four going on. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1926.74s)]
*  And it didn't start that morning. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1929.98s)]
*  It probably was a problem [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1932.94s)]
*  that's been going on for some time. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1934.42s)]
*  But because we never look, we don't find out. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1936.34s)]
*  So what we built at Fountain Life [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1939.98s)]
*  was the world's most advanced diagnostic centers. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1942.34s)]
*  We have four across the US today [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1945.46s)]
*  and we're building 20 around the world. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1947.82s)]
*  These centers give you a full body MRI, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1950.06s)]
*  a brain, a brain vasculature, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1952.98s)]
*  an AI enabled coronary CT looking for soft plaque, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1955.02s)]
*  a DEXA scan, a grail blood cancer test, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1958.1s)]
*  a full executive blood workup. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1961.46s)]
*  It's the most advanced workup you'll ever receive. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1963.54s)]
*  150 gigabytes of data that then go to our AIs [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1967.02s)]
*  and our physicians to find any disease [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1970.62s)]
*  at the very beginning when it's solvable. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1973.86s)]
*  You're gonna find out eventually. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1976.86s)]
*  Might as well find out when you can take action. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1978.82s)]
*  Fountain Life also has an entire side of therapeutics. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1981.02s)]
*  We look around the world for the most advanced therapeutics [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1984.06s)]
*  that can add 10, 20 healthy years to your life. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1986.46s)]
*  And we provide them to you at our centers. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1989.18s)]
*  So if this is of interest to you, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=1992.82s)]

*  All right, let's go back to our episode. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2036.4199999999998s)]
*  All right, next topic, a big one, drug discovery. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2038.1399999999999s)]
*  You're already working with Sanofi and UCSF. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2042.1399999999999s)]
*  Can you use the models, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2045.6999999999998s)]
*  the equations of quantum physics [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2048.2999999999997s)]
*  that the greats gave us a century ago [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2051.22s)]
*  to help me help you help everybody find [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2053.14s)]
*  this specific drug that's gonna work for them? [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2056.22s)]
*  Yeah, so this is a critical, critical challenge. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2058.1s)]
*  As we all know, eight to 10 years on average [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2060.54s)]
*  preclinical work before you get a molecule [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2064.34s)]
*  into phase one trials. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2067.46s)]
*  It's insane by the way, insane amount of time and money. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2070.2200000000003s)]
*  Absolutely crazy. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2073.82s)]
*  And then you get into trials, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2075.34s)]
*  as we all know, you got to do phase one, phase two, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2077.28s)]
*  phase three, and what is the percentage of failure [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2079.2000000000003s)]
*  in these trials as we're moving through all phases? [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2083.2400000000002s)]
*  The answer we talked about last time, 90% failure, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2085.82s)]
*  90% failure. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2089.3s)]
*  I mean, what other industry works this way? [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2090.7200000000003s)]
*  If you and I had the construction industry, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2092.62s)]
*  the Peter and Jack, a wonderful construction industry, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2094.38s)]
*  we're going to build people, hotels and buildings. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2097.2599999999998s)]
*  We said, by the way, 90% chance [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2100.22s)]
*  it's gonna fall down in 30 days. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2102.54s)]
*  Please use us, use the construction industry. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2104.62s)]
*  And we'll charge you billions per building. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2107.46s)]
*  Billions, by the way, you can't recoup, okay? [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2110.7s)]
*  But anyway, I mean, no other industry works [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2113.8199999999997s)]
*  with these kinds of failure rates. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2116.54s)]
*  And that's why that 10% success [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2118.12s)]
*  that actually gets out to market, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2120.82s)]
*  the pharma companies have to charge so much for it [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2122.7000000000003s)]
*  because it's got to pay for the 90% of failure. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2125.02s)]
*  People are like, why is everything so expensive? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2127.6200000000003s)]
*  It's because of this core dynamic. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2130.1600000000003s)]
*  The dynamic is broken. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2133.02s)]
*  And I want to remind people, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2134.78s)]
*  even after the FDA has approved this drug [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2136.2200000000003s)]
*  and you're buying it at sometimes hundreds of dollars [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2138.98s)]
*  per pill, sometimes thousands of dollars per injection, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2142.6200000000003s)]
*  it still doesn't work for everybody. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2147.6200000000003s)]
*  It's prescribed to you. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2150.1s)]
*  The success rate per individual [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2152.42s)]
*  is in the order of 10, 20, 30%. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2154.78s)]
*  Because it has to be just good enough for the FDA [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2158.2599999999998s)]
*  to give its approvals and not do harm. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2160.22s)]
*  Doesn't guarantee it's actually gonna work. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2163.34s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2165.7s)]
*  So again, people are doing their best [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2166.54s)]
*  under the current dynamic. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2168.3s)]
*  I actually believe that the biopharma companies [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2170.06s)]
*  are one of the most positive things on this planet [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2172.78s)]
*  and that they're trying their best, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2174.9s)]
*  but they don't have the right tools. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2176.6s)]
*  And so what we realized at Sandbox AQ [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2178.3s)]
*  is we can actually build that tool. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2180.7000000000003s)]
*  We can build software that would embody [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2183.2200000000003s)]
*  the molecular dynamics, the actual equations [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2186.7000000000003s)]
*  that help us understand whether this molecule [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2189.6200000000003s)]
*  would fit into that target in the body. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2192.7200000000003s)]
*  And that means, yes, it means going down [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2195.4s)]
*  to that electron level, just like people watch movies [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2198.6000000000004s)]
*  where they shrink themselves down. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2201.02s)]
*  Not really possible, but anyway, it's a movie, it's fun. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2203.2000000000003s)]
*  But we have to, in our minds, get ourselves down [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2205.62s)]
*  to that electron level, because that valence electron, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2209.2599999999998s)]
*  that outer electron on that edge of that atom, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2211.58s)]
*  of that molecule that we call it a treatment, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2214.58s)]
*  it's gotta lock in, like lock and key, [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2217.2599999999998s)]
*  into one of the electrons that is on the outer edge [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2220.24s)]
*  of the receptor, and there's gotta be binding. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2224.1s)]
*  If there's no binding, we're not gonna have efficacy. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2226.3399999999997s)]
*  And by the way, if we also start binding to other things, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2229.48s)]
*  what we call off-target effects, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2232.8399999999997s)]
*  that is things we don't wanna bind to, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2234.74s)]
*  we could have toxic side effects. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2236.62s)]
*  And so we've gotta look at both. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2239.22s)]
*  We've gotta check what it's gonna bind to, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2241.12s)]
*  that we want it to bind to, and what's gonna bind to, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2243.14s)]
*  that we don't want it to bind to. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2245.62s)]
*  And so this becomes a very complicated set of equations [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2247.56s)]
*  and calculations, and the conventional wisdom, Peter, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2250.9799999999996s)]
*  was if we go back, roll back six, seven years, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2253.18s)]
*  oh, this is not possible on conventional computers. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2257.1s)]
*  This is not possible, and you won't be able to do this. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2259.9399999999996s)]
*  In fact, fast forward, what we've shown is actually, [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2263.46s)]
*  we can do it. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2266.34s)]
*  It was a lot of collaboration with folks [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2267.94s)]
*  who are designing chips at Alphabet, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2271.34s)]
*  and then of course now with NVIDIA, [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2273.34s)]
*  we've announced several times various partnerships [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2274.94s)]
*  with NVIDIA that allowed us to expand the CUDA language [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2277.98s)]
*  that is inside, embedded inside the chip, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2283.56s)]
*  and give ourselves the ability to go into this [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2286.02s)]
*  large quantitative models, quantitative AI, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2288.42s)]
*  that embodies with it the ability to calculate [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2291.46s)]
*  the quantum equations on a scale basis, [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2294.32s)]
*  use that as a generated data set. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2297.16s)]
*  So people talk about what data drives your AI model, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2299.82s)]
*  and normally what they're thinking of in their head is, [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2303.92s)]
*  what data from the outside world drives your model. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2306.2200000000003s)]
*  In the case of large language models, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2309.58s)]
*  that is all the words on the internet. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2311.38s)]
*  They just suck at Reddit, and suck at X, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2314.08s)]
*  and Instagram posts, and things like that, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2316.54s)]
*  and social media comments. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2319.82s)]
*  And that becomes their data set. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2322.1400000000003s)]
*  And here, we're actually generating the data set, Peter, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2324.1000000000004s)]
*  from the equations themselves. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2327.5800000000004s)]
*  Because they don't exist out there. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2329.46s)]
*  They can't be found on the internet. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2332.02s)]
*  You need to create the data set and interpolate from there. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2334.26s)]
*  That's right, exactly right, yeah. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2336.82s)]
*  So that allows us to have this big leap forward. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2338.5s)]
*  We're now already with real molecules for various [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2342.02s)]
*  neurodegenerative diseases from UCSF, [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2346.7000000000003s)]
*  a Nobel Prize winning laboratory. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2349.22s)]
*  We've been able to really help them refine the molecules [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2351.66s)]
*  that they started with, and help them cut the time, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2355.8199999999997s)]
*  cut the cost, and get them into clinic much, much faster. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2358.8599999999997s)]
*  And so this is a very, very exciting moment [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2363.2599999999998s)]
*  in the history of humanity, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2366.18s)]
*  and our ability to create treatments. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2367.66s)]
*  And when we think about the number of approved drugs [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2369.4199999999996s)]
*  every year, listeners may think that hundreds or thousands [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2371.7799999999997s)]
*  of new drugs are approved a year. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2375.62s)]
*  In fact, it's on average about 48 to 50 new drugs [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2377.16s)]
*  a year approved, and most of those, [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2381.2799999999997s)]
*  three quarters of those, Peter, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2382.64s)]
*  are not first in human drugs. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2384.08s)]
*  They're Me Too drugs, where somebody has a variation [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2386.2799999999997s)]
*  on a theme. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2389.12s)]
*  And so there's only about a dozen or so first in human [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2390.04s)]
*  novel drugs approved a year, for the world. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2394.68s)]
*  Yeah. For the world. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2398.3199999999997s)]
*  This is a huge area. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2399.8399999999997s)]
*  There are companies like in Silicon Medicine, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2402.3599999999997s)]
*  and others that have been working in this area. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2404.52s)]
*  You're bringing a different set of technical tools. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2406.4s)]
*  But the future here is the ability. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2410.0s)]
*  We also spoke last time about the work that DeepMind [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2412.92s)]
*  is doing in AlphaFold, AlphaFold 3, AlphaProdio, and such. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2417.36s)]
*  But again, this is a brand new set of tools [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2421.8s)]
*  to help model drugs in silico. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2424.4s)]
*  But it's a future as well, where you're [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2431.4s)]
*  going to be able to create, if you would, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2433.64s)]
*  virtualized clinical trials to make sure before it [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2437.12s)]
*  goes into humans, we know it works with a high probability. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2440.24s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2444.3599999999997s)]
*  We still need those clinical trials. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2445.16s)]
*  The FDA still requires that. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2446.7599999999998s)]
*  Understood. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2448.3599999999997s)]
*  But we can basically run through a scenario [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2449.2799999999997s)]
*  of what that clinical trial is going to actually yield [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2452.7599999999998s)]
*  before we go into the actual human clinical trial. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2455.68s)]
*  So this is complementary to tools. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2460.12s)]
*  For example, you mentioned in Silicon Medicine, great company. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2462.76s)]
*  And we're finding ourselves bringing [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2466.1600000000003s)]
*  a complementary and powerful new set of tools to the table. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2467.7200000000003s)]
*  And hopefully, all working together, [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2471.92s)]
*  we can really have a lot of breakthroughs. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2473.96s)]
*  So that's just in the biopharma space. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2475.84s)]
*  And of course, Peter, molecules are molecules. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2477.44s)]
*  Atoms are atoms. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2480.6400000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2481.88s)]
*  Chemistry for batteries. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2482.7200000000003s)]
*  For my favorite, I still want you to help me solve [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2484.36s)]
*  temperature superconducting. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2487.8s)]
*  That's a big one. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2489.0s)]
*  Real quick, I've been getting the most unusual compliments [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2490.6s)]
*  lately on my skin. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2493.2799999999997s)]
*  Truth is, I use a lotion every morning and every night [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2495.08s)]
*  religiously called One Skin. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2498.68s)]
*  It was developed by four PhD women [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2500.56s)]
*  who determined a 10 amino acid sequence that [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2503.2799999999997s)]
*  is a synolytic that kills senile cells in your skin. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2506.8399999999997s)]
*  And this literally reverses the age of your skin. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2510.6s)]
*  And I think it's one of the most incredible products. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2513.88s)]
*  I use it all the time. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2516.08s)]
*  If you're interested, check out the show notes. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2518.44s)]
*  I've asked my team to link to it below. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2520.28s)]
*  All right, let's get back to the episode. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2522.2400000000002s)]
*  Let's go to one last subject here [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2524.0400000000004s)]
*  because I know a lot of the folks listening and watching [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2526.0400000000004s)]
*  are Bitcoin holders, crypto holders. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2529.36s)]
*  And the scary boogie man out there [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2532.76s)]
*  is once we have quantum computing, [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2535.28s)]
*  we can crack every code. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2536.6800000000003s)]
*  And my wallet and your wallet is open to anyone [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2538.28s)]
*  with a good quantum computer. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2541.48s)]
*  So there's a last one. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2542.6800000000003s)]
*  Maybe it's one of many, but one that we've discussed, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2545.6400000000003s)]
*  which is your active guard. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2548.2000000000003s)]
*  So tell me, how are you protecting my Bitcoin wallet? [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2549.44s)]
*  So active guard, which is AQTIVE, active guard, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2552.96s)]
*  again, bringing the AI and quantum aspects together here, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2556.52s)]
*  is critical because what's happening now [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2561.56s)]
*  is a very big moment in the safeguarding of our data [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2564.8s)]
*  and of our digital currencies. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2569.28s)]
*  The last time a major security protocol was rolled out [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2571.44s)]
*  to the world, Peter, was in the late 70s and early 80s. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2575.16s)]
*  Three individuals, R, S, and A, Ravestamir Adelman, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2578.88s)]
*  developed an incredible idea [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2582.8s)]
*  that we could actually exchange information [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2585.48s)]
*  over the wild and woolly west of the internet [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2588.1200000000003s)]
*  without having to meet first in a bunker. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2590.6800000000003s)]
*  Prior to that, we'd have to meet in a bunker, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2593.28s)]
*  we'd have to exchange keypads, [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2596.04s)]
*  we'd have to say on Monday, we're gonna use the following key [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2598.44s)]
*  and we're gonna scramble information with that, [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2601.52s)]
*  and then you'll descramble with that key. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2603.44s)]
*  So that's symmetric key encryption. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2605.44s)]
*  Symmetric, because we're both using the same key [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2608.04s)]
*  to encrypt and to decrypt, right? [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2610.44s)]
*  And that's how we did things in World War I [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2612.76s)]
*  and World War II, and that's how Caesar did it [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2614.92s)]
*  with the Caesar sites. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2617.6s)]
*  The Enigma code and all, yes. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2618.44s)]
*  Yeah, all that stuff, symmetric key. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2620.44s)]
*  But we know the limitations of that, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2623.72s)]
*  because if we had to pay for everything on Amazon that way, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2625.44s)]
*  we'd have to fly to Seattle every time we wanted to, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2628.48s)]
*  exchange the keys, go back, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2631.88s)]
*  then use our credit card with that, [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2634.44s)]
*  and then somebody might find that key [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2636.04s)]
*  and go from there. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2638.76s)]
*  But what RSA gave us is asymmetric keys. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2639.6s)]
*  And so the private key is different than the public key. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2642.44s)]
*  And so by doing that, I can find Amazon's public key, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2646.04s)]
*  my browser can grab it, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2649.76s)]
*  it encrypts my credit card with Amazon's public key, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2651.28s)]
*  I send it to Amazon, and they use their private key [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2654.4s)]
*  to now decrypt it and charge my credit card, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2657.7200000000003s)]
*  which makes me very, very happy. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2661.36s)]
*  So what we now have is a beautiful system, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2663.76s)]
*  and that's the bedrock, Peter, [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2666.28s)]
*  of our multi, multi trillion dollar economy [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2668.5600000000004s)]
*  around the world. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2673.7200000000003s)]
*  Without this ability, yes, e-commerce is part of, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2675.0400000000004s)]
*  but also ACH, wire transfers, [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2677.84s)]
*  also the ability to share information [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2680.28s)]
*  and have private patient data in your hospital. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2682.48s)]
*  All this is encrypted and stored and protected [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2685.44s)]
*  by asymmetric key cryptography. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2689.2400000000002s)]
*  And RSA is an example. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2692.2400000000002s)]
*  Another example is ECC elliptic curve cryptography. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2693.64s)]
*  It was initially thought years ago [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2697.3599999999997s)]
*  that elliptic curve would form a bulwark, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2699.08s)]
*  would be resistant to the quantum attack, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2701.4s)]
*  but it turns out it's just as amenable to attack as RSA. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2703.92s)]
*  And what we now know, [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2707.56s)]
*  and what Peter Shor showed in his 1994 paper [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2708.8799999999997s)]
*  when he was at Bell Labs, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2712.04s)]
*  Peter Shor is now respected scientist at MIT. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2713.2s)]
*  And what he showed in his 94 papers [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2716.52s)]
*  that ultimately quantum computers will crack, [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2718.7999999999997s)]
*  will bring down RSA, ECC, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2722.16s)]
*  and the other asymmetric key protocols [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2725.3199999999997s)]
*  that we use every single day in our phones. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2727.72s)]
*  When you use WhatsApp and it says encrypted end to end, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2730.2s)]
*  what is that encryption? [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2733.72s)]
*  That is this asymmetric key encryption [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2735.04s)]
*  we're talking about here right now. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2737.08s)]
*  And so as quantum computer companies, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2739.24s)]
*  the people building the hardware, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2742.2s)]
*  there's a few dozen of them out there, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2743.56s)]
*  getting better and better at scale and fault tolerant, [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2745.12s)]
*  we're getting closer to Q day. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2748.48s)]
*  We're getting closer to that day [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2750.2s)]
*  when quantum computers will crack RSA, ECC. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2752.76s)]
*  So the world, thank God in this case, [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2755.28s)]
*  actually has been preparing. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2757.56s)]
*  The governments of the world, those of us in industry, [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2759.8s)]
*  academia have been collaborating for eight years now [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2762.4s)]
*  and to find a new set of protocols [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2765.12s)]
*  that would resist this quantum attack. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2768.0s)]
*  We call it PQC, post quantum cryptography. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2770.68s)]
*  Assume quantum is here in the post quantum world, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2774.0s)]
*  how do we encrypt? [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2777.08s)]
*  And I'm happy to say that on August 13th, this year, [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2778.56s)]
*  2024, just about two months ago, [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2782.04s)]
*  in fact, the governments of the world announced [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2784.96s)]
*  that we now have standardized a set of PQC protocols. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2787.36s)]
*  These are ways of encrypting using asymmetric keys also, [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2791.7599999999998s)]
*  private public, but in a way that is not using [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2795.32s)]
*  the number theoretic frameworks [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2798.84s)]
*  that we had back from RSA and ECC. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2801.16s)]
*  In fact, they're doing it in such a way [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2803.84s)]
*  that is not amenable to quantum attack. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2805.2s)]
*  There are also other ways of protecting your data [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2808.56s)]
*  using QKD, quantum key distribution. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2810.44s)]
*  Maybe in another podcast, we'll go into that. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2813.2400000000002s)]
*  But bottom line is, what we had to do with ActiveGuard, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2815.48s)]
*  we at Sandbox AQ realized that the world, [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2819.12s)]
*  every bank, every government, every telco, [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2821.64s)]
*  every individual ultimately, [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2823.92s)]
*  needed to look at their encryption on their phones, [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2825.56s)]
*  in their servers, in the cloud, on premises, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2828.76s)]
*  inventory it in a scaled way and start creating a triage [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2831.6s)]
*  and then a roadmap of migration to the new protocols. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2835.68s)]
*  For a bank, that typically takes seven to 10 years. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2839.64s)]
*  A typical migration takes seven to 10 years. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2844.0s)]
*  Now let's get back to Bitcoin. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2847.16s)]
*  So Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2848.64s)]
*  why do we call it cryptocurrencies? [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2850.8799999999997s)]
*  Because these are based on encryption, right? [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2853.24s)]
*  That's the cryptography in cryptocurrencies. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2855.8799999999997s)]
*  And the encryption they're based on, [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2859.3199999999997s)]
*  unfortunately, is RSA and ECC. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2861.3599999999997s)]
*  Bitcoin, Ethereum, each one is based on either RSA [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2865.2s)]
*  or ECC or variations thereof. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2868.68s)]
*  And so ultimately, we've got to redo the foundations [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2870.7599999999998s)]
*  of blockchain itself. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2875.3599999999997s)]
*  And of course, everything that built on blockchain [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2877.08s)]
*  will then be helped, be it cryptocurrencies [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2879.16s)]
*  or other blockchain types of applications, [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2881.8399999999997s)]
*  digital contracts, and so on and so forth. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2884.3999999999996s)]
*  And so that's gonna be work to be done [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2887.2799999999997s)]
*  over the next five years. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2889.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm hoping, and I put out an invitation now [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2891.7999999999997s)]
*  to the blockchain community, let's start working together [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2895.0s)]
*  to start migrating these applications over time. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2898.32s)]
*  Because what we don't want is for someone [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2902.2000000000003s)]
*  to have a real-time quantum computer in the future, [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2904.1600000000003s)]
*  be able to see that your transaction is about to go through [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2906.7200000000003s)]
*  of your spend, of your transfer of Bitcoin, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2909.84s)]
*  and then be able to spoof in at that moment [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2912.4s)]
*  and double spend that particular coin. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2915.48s)]
*  That could happen in the future. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2919.44s)]
*  The quantum computers do not exist today to do that, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2921.56s)]
*  but that's why. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2924.28s)]
*  Look how long it took to fork Bitcoin [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2925.1200000000003s)]
*  in terms of the kind of forks we've had to do [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2927.52s)]
*  over the years. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2929.96s)]
*  This takes time, we've got to start now. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2931.0s)]
*  And the post-quantum encryption protocols [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2933.8s)]
*  that have been adopted, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2936.44s)]
*  are governments and institutions [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2939.28s)]
*  beginning to roll those out today? [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2941.4s)]
*  They're beginning to make that migration. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2943.76s)]
*  So the first step, just like we talked about, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2945.44s)]
*  when you feel like, hey, I don't feel exactly right, [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2947.64s)]
*  I've got some symptoms, you go to a hospital, [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2950.28s)]
*  you go to a clinic, you get diagnosed. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2952.56s)]
*  So the first step in the migration from RSA ECC [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2954.64s)]
*  to the new post-quantum protocols is diagnostics. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2958.56s)]
*  Yes, we have to take a inventory continuously [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2962.7999999999997s)]
*  of all the files and the applications [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2966.44s)]
*  and the network sockets in a large organization. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2969.3599999999997s)]
*  And that's what ActiveGuard does. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2972.2s)]
*  It does so on a scalable basis, using some smarts. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2973.64s)]
*  It goes into the network, finds all the encryption [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2977.44s)]
*  that's being used in a large bank, a large telco, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2980.48s)]
*  a large organization, and then inventories it, [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2983.8s)]
*  gives the CISO, the Chief Information Security Officer, [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2986.8s)]
*  and their entire team a report, a continuous report, [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2989.8s)]
*  a dashboard, here's what's good, here's what's not good. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2993.0s)]
*  And then gives them a roadmap to say, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2996.0s)]
*  this is really important data, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=2998.6400000000003s)]
*  let's migrate this first over to the new protocols. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3000.28s)]
*  Here's something you probably could wait on. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3003.88s)]
*  Maybe you can wait two years on that. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3005.76s)]
*  Because given resources, you have to make choices. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3007.6000000000004s)]
*  So that's what ActiveGuard is about, Peter. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3010.1600000000003s)]
*  It's about this huge global migration [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3011.88s)]
*  that we're undertaking now. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3015.84s)]
*  But it's not just a one-time thing. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3017.56s)]
*  This is not just like Y2K, okay, we did it, woo-hoo! [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3018.92s)]
*  This is something that we always have to guard against [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3022.8s)]
*  because what happens is coders are writing [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3025.96s)]
*  new applications all the time, [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3028.08s)]
*  and they could also be using bad encryption. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3030.0s)]
*  And two examples of bad encryption. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3032.6800000000003s)]
*  Please, listeners, ask your CISOs, ask your cyber people [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3034.56s)]
*  if they're using that in your organization. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3038.4s)]
*  MD5 and SHA-1 are two examples of hashing protocols [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3041.08s)]
*  that are used throughout our government [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3045.6800000000003s)]
*  and banking systems today. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3048.84s)]
*  Nobody wants to be using them, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3050.48s)]
*  but these are ways of protecting passwords [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3052.32s)]
*  that have been broken. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3054.56s)]
*  Back in 2008 to 2009, these two particular ways [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3055.88s)]
*  of protecting your passwords have been already broken. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3059.6s)]
*  But unfortunately, organizations got so big, [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3062.44s)]
*  and their IT systems got so big, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3065.12s)]
*  it's hard to ferret all these out. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3067.12s)]
*  That's what ActiveGuard does. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3069.16s)]
*  It ferrets it out, alerts the cyber team, [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3070.48s)]
*  and then we'll fix it if the cyber team wants the software [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3073.24s)]
*  to indeed fix it. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3076.8399999999997s)]
*  So there's all kinds of things we must guard against [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3077.7999999999997s)]
*  in the encryption area. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3080.44s)]
*  But this, Peter, is the new emerging space in cyber. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3081.88s)]
*  Of course, there are many tools already for antiviral, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3085.2s)]
*  antiviruses, malware, firewalls, all good tools. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3088.68s)]
*  We need all those tools. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3093.2799999999997s)]
*  The emerging part of CyberNow is modern encryption management. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3094.6s)]
*  Modern encryption management. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3099.72s)]
*  Jack Hittery, I'm always re-energized. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3101.2s)]
*  You are a nuclear power source, [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmxHH_P0eM&t=3104.44s)]
