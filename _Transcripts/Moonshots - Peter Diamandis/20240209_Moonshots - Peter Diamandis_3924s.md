# First Neuralink Implanted & Where Other Tech Giants Are Headed w/ Salim Ismail | EP #85
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [February 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY)
*  We're literally within a site of that type of abundance where every single person on [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=0.0s)]
*  the planet can be fed and clothed and have energy. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=6.16s)]
*  Five years, ten years, or twenty years? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=9.24s)]
*  I think we're within five years. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=11.64s)]
*  Now things get really interesting because you get a distributed intelligence that can [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=16.86s)]
*  be applied, learned once and applied a million times. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=20.92s)]
*  Every percent increase I can increase my brain processing power. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=25.060000000000002s)]
*  That's just a game changer. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=29.52s)]
*  The ability to think things into existence is going to be powerful. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=31.0s)]
*  People forget that scaling things is an engineering problem, not an invention problem. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=34.54s)]
*  Once you figure out the invention of it, then the scaling is actually not that difficult. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=38.6s)]
*  We tend to make linear our future extrapolations even though we're faced with this amazing [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=42.9s)]
*  exponential growth. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=50.32s)]
*  Welcome back to Moonshots. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=54.0s)]
*  Peter Diamandis here. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=55.28s)]
*  This is my favorite segment of the month. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=57.38s)]
*  It's WTF Just Happened in Technology with my dear brother, Salim Ismail. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=59.64s)]
*  We're going to be looking at what just happened in the news and what's hot and what we think [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  of it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=70.36s)]
*  Let's jump in. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=71.68s)]
*  Salim, welcome pal. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=72.68s)]
*  Good to be here. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=73.68s)]
*  Good to be back. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=74.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=75.68s)]
*  I mean, it's blinding speed and I don't know, I'm having a blast. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=76.68s)]
*  I think it's just so interesting. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=84.12s)]
*  Every day you have no idea what's going to show up. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=85.88s)]
*  Your mind is blown every month or two with something that happens. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=88.28s)]
*  You almost want to do this more often than monthly just because there's so much going [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=92.2s)]
*  on. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  I'll call you every morning. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  Lily will be really upset at me. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  It really is. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=101.92s)]
*  I literally wake up. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=102.92s)]
*  The first thing I do is I look at my Google News. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=103.92s)]
*  I look at my, I got to say Twitter stream. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  I did a podcast with Elon and I'm like, you know, it's like, do I call it? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=112.68s)]
*  What do I call it? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=116.72s)]
*  I asked, looking at my X stream, I guess it's like it will eventually flip our neuron. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=117.72s)]
*  We will eventually let go of Twitter, but he needs to give us something to hold on to. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=124.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=129.24s)]
*  I think it'll happen when he's doing payment processing. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=130.24s)]
*  For me, the thing that's going to be a game changer is when he allows, turns every crypto [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  user and gives every X user, a Twitter user a crypto wallet. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=138.28s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=142.44s)]
*  And that's going to be an inflection point. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=143.44s)]
*  He'll be instantly the biggest bank in the world. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=144.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=146.44s)]
*  I mean, it will give you a, X will give you a sovereign identity and a wallet and an interface [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=147.44s)]
*  to all crypto and NFTs and everything you own. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=154.0s)]
*  And it will be the everything. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=157.76s)]
*  It'll make Amazon look like really small potatoes. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=159.56s)]
*  So I would never, you know, people say, you know, would you bet on Elon and this stuff? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=163.52s)]
*  I would never bet against him. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=167.88s)]
*  Well, this is the key point, right? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=169.56s)]
*  People complain about it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  And I have my big beefs about Twitter and what's going on there. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=172.51999999999998s)]
*  But when he looks, when you talk to him about that and you hear him speak about that and [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=177.88s)]
*  he says, we're swinging for the fences and we may throw out a bunch of features that [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=181.96s)]
*  don't work, but one out of five could be a home run and then off you go. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=186.51999999999998s)]
*  And that's just awesome. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=190.76s)]
*  So I teed up a few fun news items that really like, like snap my gaze. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=192.72s)]
*  Here's the first one I found amazing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=200.88s)]
*  This year, Google was spending more on compute than people. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=203.66s)]
*  So Google invests 30 billion on data center expenditures and Microsoft 50 billion. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  Insane, right? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=213.68s)]
*  So it's another tipping point is the amount of chip compute over brain compute on the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=215.4s)]
*  planet. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=222.72s)]
*  And I think we pass that or about to pass that the amount of processing power resident [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=223.72s)]
*  in 8 billion brains, which is a hundred billion, a hundred billion neurons per brain, a hundred [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=227.96s)]
*  trillion synoptic connections per brain. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=233.0s)]
*  I mean, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=235.48000000000002s)]
*  it's just a lot of zeros, but you're saying the chip compute exceeds the brain compute [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=236.48000000000002s)]
*  globally. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=240.20000000000002s)]
*  I think it's either we pass that or it's very close. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=241.20000000000002s)]
*  And people, so this is fascinating, right? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=245.28s)]
*  So where do you, if you're a tech company, where do you spend your next hundred thousand [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=249.4s)]
*  or your next hundred million? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=253.60000000000002s)]
*  Do you hire smarter people or do you spend it on tech? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  Well I think you spend it on tech and it goes to that comment we had the other week where [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=259.56s)]
*  we said you can now build a billion dollar company with three people. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=264.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=269.40000000000003s)]
*  Sam Altman just said one person with a billion dollar company, by the way. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=270.40000000000003s)]
*  So it's just shrinking to absurd levels and the value creation, I think, delivered by [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=273.24s)]
*  technology. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=279.96000000000004s)]
*  So for our moonshot listeners, your goal to take a moonshot is it's a billion dollar [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=280.96000000000004s)]
*  company or a hundred billion person with a company with three people. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=284.44s)]
*  I mean, the other flip side of it is are we about to demonetize the economy where money [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=288.48s)]
*  has that much less meaning? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=295.76s)]
*  I think this speaks to your abundance concept, right? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=296.88s)]
*  Like once you have abundance, then money kind of doesn't matter. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=299.56s)]
*  And everybody has a lot of whatever they can tip. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=303.56s)]
*  I think, I don't know why we can't flip as quickly as possible into like a Burning Man [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=306.35999999999996s)]
*  type economy, which is a gifting economy. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=310.76s)]
*  And if you need stuff- [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=313.88s)]
*  Wear your scantily clothed. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=314.88s)]
*  At least the weather, if the weather provides it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=315.88s)]
*  This year on the weather, it was the mud economy. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=320.28s)]
*  It was like the economy at Burning Man this year during the rains was plastic bags to [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=322.67999999999995s)]
*  wrap around your sneakers so that you could actually make it through the mud. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=329.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=334.47999999999996s)]
*  I mean, yeah. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=335.47999999999996s)]
*  And those are very high class problems. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=336.47999999999996s)]
*  But I think as we deliver more and more, imagine a little community in the Western Sahara, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=338.67999999999995s)]
*  right? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=346.47999999999996s)]
*  You have water extraction out of the atmosphere. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=347.47999999999996s)]
*  You have satellite internet via Starlink. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=349.76s)]
*  You have energy production via solar. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=352.38s)]
*  You have local battery. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=355.28s)]
*  Protein production via- [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=356.28s)]
*  Vertical farming and microgreens, which are like you kind of don't need much else. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=357.88s)]
*  And I think we're literally within a site of that type of abundance where every single [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=364.28s)]
*  person on the planet can be fed and clothed and have energy- [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=369.97999999999996s)]
*  Five years, 10 years, or 20 years? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=373.4s)]
*  I think we're within five years. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=375.96s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=377.88s)]
*  You know, of course, the end point, when I was at MIT as an undergrad and grad student, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=378.88s)]
*  there was a guy named Eric Drexler there. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=383.68s)]
*  Sure. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=385.88s)]
*  Of course. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=386.88s)]
*  So Eric wrote an amazing book. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=387.88s)]
*  I'm so proud. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=390.20000000000005s)]
*  I was credited in the opening notes of that book because I reviewed his draft. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=391.28000000000003s)]
*  It's called The Engines of Creation. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=396.0s)]
*  And he talks about the future of nanotech, right? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=398.72s)]
*  Where we have assemblers. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=403.36s)]
*  And an assembler, for those who don't know because you haven't read Engines of Creation [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=405.1s)]
*  or you're not a geek or enough of a geek, but most people listening to this are, an [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=409.5s)]
*  assembler is a little micro, a molecular machine that can pull a carbon atom from here, nitrogen [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=415.94s)]
*  from here, or silicon from here, and build things on an atomic level. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=423.06s)]
*  And so if I have an assembler in my hand and I command it to generate, copy itself, and [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=427.5s)]
*  I give you one. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=433.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=434.66s)]
*  Now you've got an assembler, I have an assembler. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=435.66s)]
*  I take my assembler and I throw it in the ground and I say, build me an electric Ferrari. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=436.82000000000005s)]
*  And it says, OK, I'm going to get the design, the data is open source, it's free. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=443.94s)]
*  The energy to build it is from solar or fusion, it's effectively free. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=450.90000000000003s)]
*  And then it's really the material cost. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=456.26000000000005s)]
*  And you may need to throw it a chunk of titanium or lithium or something. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=459.14000000000004s)]
*  But all of a sudden, stuff becomes really cheap. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=463.66s)]
*  Well, I remember Ralph Merkel talking about this. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=466.62s)]
*  And he said, you should be able to build anything for about a dollar a pound. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=469.94s)]
*  Ralph was one of our faculty members in the nanotech field at Singularity University in [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=473.42s)]
*  the early days. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=479.06s)]
*  Brilliant guy. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=480.06s)]
*  Brilliant. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=481.06s)]
*  More famous because I remember there's been one of the lectures, somebody said, are you [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=482.06s)]
*  Ralph Merkel from Merkel hash trees? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=486.26000000000005s)]
*  And Merkel hash trees are the basis of Bitcoin. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=489.74s)]
*  He used to use the one way encryption. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=492.54s)]
*  And he goes, yeah, that was me. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=493.54s)]
*  But that was like, you know, decades ago. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=494.86s)]
*  So in the 1980s, he conceived of Merkel hash trees, which then 30 years later. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=497.06s)]
*  So I actually did a session with him about about two years ago. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=502.82s)]
*  Uh huh. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=505.78s)]
*  An interview. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=506.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=507.78s)]
*  I said, where are we going with computation? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=508.78s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=509.78s)]
*  And he goes, oh, I'm working on a paper that for thermodynamically reversible computation, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=510.78s)]
*  which means you take the heat out of the computation. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=515.5s)]
*  I said, how do you get there? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=518.18s)]
*  He goes, well, if you do computation using molecular bonds to form the one zero zeros, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=519.42s)]
*  you essentially can read or write and then you don't generate any heat. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=525.3399999999999s)]
*  I'm like, okay. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=529.02s)]
*  And what will that give us? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=530.02s)]
*  He goes, oh, 10 orders of magnitude on top of this. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=531.02s)]
*  The transistor is per per square millimeter, at least 10 extra zeros. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=533.9399999999999s)]
*  Moore's law is another 10 orders of magnitude just from that. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=539.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=542.14s)]
*  And you're like, okay, in terms of a bridge to quantum or whatever, like this is so this [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=543.14s)]
*  is, you know, people could worry that we're running out of, um, uh, computational capability [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=548.62s)]
*  and you talk to Ralph and it just goes so far past what you're thinking. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=553.18s)]
*  And this is the, this is where people kind of really lose their weight. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=558.14s)]
*  They get so stuck on, oh, silicon chips can only deliver so much. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=561.8199999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=565.58s)]
*  And then you have to go to them and go, listen, we have probs get coming, which takes us widely [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=566.58s)]
*  abundant. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=570.86s)]
*  It's like a salt and they're just working on how to scaling it. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=571.86s)]
*  And people forget that scaling things as an engineering problem, not an invention problem. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=575.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=579.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=580.54s)]
*  And once you figure out the invention of it, then the scaling is actually not that difficult. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=581.54s)]
*  You know, it's like, you know, nothing can go past the steam engine or nothing can travel [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=584.9799999999999s)]
*  or faster than a horse or train. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=588.66s)]
*  It's over and over again. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=591.18s)]
*  I mean, when do we actually figure that out and stop saying never? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=592.18s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=596.3399999999999s)]
*  Well, Ray figured it out a while ago. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=597.3399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=599.5s)]
*  Ray Kurzweil. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=600.5s)]
*  Ray Kurzweil. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=601.5s)]
*  And the rest of us are kind of catching up to it now. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=602.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=603.5s)]
*  So here's another story from the news this week. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=605.18s)]
*  And this is a company in Silicon Valley called Figure. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=610.5s)]
*  Full disclosure, my venture fund is an investor in Figure. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=614.78s)]
*  And there's a whole breed of humanoid robots coming out. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=618.86s)]
*  I want to talk about three of them. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=621.46s)]
*  And the gentleman who is the CEO of Figure has built a number of moonshot companies previous [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=625.54s)]
*  to this. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=635.38s)]
*  But here's a quick video clip of Figure making a cup of coffee. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=636.46s)]
*  Let's check it out. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=640.46s)]
*  Can you make me a cup of coffee? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=641.46s)]
*  That might not look as impressive as it is. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=654.74s)]
*  I was talking to Brett Adcock, who's the CEO. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=676.7s)]
*  He's the moonshot entrepreneur here. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=680.0600000000001s)]
*  And he was telling me about a day where they went from programming this to how to move [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=682.1s)]
*  the joints and so forth to the day they had generative AI watch a human do that thing [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=689.94s)]
*  over and over and over again. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=698.4200000000001s)]
*  And the generative AI model is what the software that drives that thing. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=700.22s)]
*  So what we're seeing is basically a neural net inside this robot watching and learning [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=705.5s)]
*  by repetition, which is the way kids learn. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=712.26s)]
*  So I have an issue. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=716.3s)]
*  All right. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=718.54s)]
*  But before you let me show you one other news. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=719.54s)]
*  So this came out today. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=721.38s)]
*  And this is Microsoft and OpenAI are in talks to inject $500 million into humanoid robotics, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=723.94s)]
*  in particular with Figure AI. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=730.38s)]
*  I don't know what your issue is, but Microsoft and OpenAI think it's worth a half a billion [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=732.9399999999999s)]
*  dollars of injected capital. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=736.78s)]
*  So tell me your issue now. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=738.54s)]
*  This is my defense mechanism. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=740.66s)]
*  Fair enough. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=742.14s)]
*  When you talk about there may be lots of classes of applications where humanoid robots are [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=744.26s)]
*  really valuable. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=749.42s)]
*  Mining applications where it's really dangerous or a toxic environment, for example. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=751.2199999999999s)]
*  Bring me my dinner. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=754.9399999999999s)]
*  No, I think that's where it falls down. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=755.9399999999999s)]
*  So let me give you the example. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=758.56s)]
*  The robot or the case study? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=760.14s)]
*  The anecdote here. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=762.2199999999999s)]
*  So take a Roomba vacuum cleaner robot. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=764.38s)]
*  Once you use a Roomba for a while, you stop using it. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=767.9s)]
*  Why? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=770.62s)]
*  Because you still have to go and prep the room for the robot. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=771.62s)]
*  You have to pick up all the colander off the things and da da da da da and it gets stuck [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=774.9399999999999s)]
*  on slanted things. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=779.18s)]
*  There's like 100 little things it can't do. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=780.38s)]
*  You must have an old Roomba. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=781.9s)]
*  And by the time you finish configuring the room, you might as well just vacuum the room [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=783.0999999999999s)]
*  yourself. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=786.9799999999999s)]
*  This is the same difficulty with self-driving cars. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=788.0600000000001s)]
*  And God knows I'm one of the people that die. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=792.74s)]
*  I'm dying for the self-driving car. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=795.5s)]
*  So listen, you got a Tesla. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=797.38s)]
*  By the way, I've got a Tesla that I've driven four times from Miami to Toronto or New York [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=798.38s)]
*  and back. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=802.62s)]
*  So I've crossed the country. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=803.62s)]
*  I may be one of the longest distance driving Tesla drivers, owners anywhere in the world. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=804.62s)]
*  I've done 10,000 miles back and forth. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=811.02s)]
*  Now, it's incredibly valuable getting on the highway, hitting the button for autonomous [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=814.38s)]
*  mode and then eating a shawarma. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=818.62s)]
*  But you don't have the self-driving beta right now, right? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=820.9s)]
*  Which I do on my Tesla. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=824.38s)]
*  No, this is just a straight autopilot. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=825.38s)]
*  I know that. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=826.38s)]
*  And so the self-driving mode will take me from door to door without me touching it. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=827.38s)]
*  A few moments of being a little bit nervous, but it works amazing. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=833.22s)]
*  And Phoenix now has self-driving taxis, Waymo, et cetera, and it's coming. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=838.86s)]
*  But look how long it's taken. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=842.98s)]
*  We first posited that in 2012, 2013, that within five, six years, you'd have a large [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=845.5s)]
*  percentage, a meaningful percentage. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=851.1800000000001s)]
*  We were off by that. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=853.58s)]
*  And here's why. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=854.7s)]
*  Elon was slow. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=855.7s)]
*  No, no. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=856.7s)]
*  It's the fact that driving, which is moving around in a physical environment, is just [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=857.7s)]
*  inherently very hard. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=863.98s)]
*  You drive, you weave a little bit to avoid a pot. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=866.46s)]
*  I live in New Jersey, this pothole center. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=869.14s)]
*  And you weave around a pothole. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=872.1800000000001s)]
*  A self-driving car doesn't see any of that stuff. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=875.34s)]
*  And so there's lots of little things. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=878.86s)]
*  It'll get there eventually. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=880.5s)]
*  But it's like the Roomba. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=882.1800000000001s)]
*  It's just going to take a long time before it gets to the point where it can handle those [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=883.1800000000001s)]
*  things. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=886.58s)]
*  There was a change this year, pal. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=887.58s)]
*  There was a fundamental change this year. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=888.6600000000001s)]
*  So I call it the, that's my version of the uncanny valley for robotics. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=892.1800000000001s)]
*  It's like dealing with these stupid niggly things. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=896.22s)]
*  So what's the uncanny valley? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=897.98s)]
*  The uncanny valley is a physical adaptation to local physical phenomena is just a really [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=899.78s)]
*  difficult task. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=907.3399999999999s)]
*  Can I go back and tell a story about Dan Berry here? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=908.42s)]
*  So Dan Berry was an astronaut faculty member. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=911.3s)]
*  He'd flown five times to the space station. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=914.02s)]
*  And he was building robots. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=917.8199999999999s)]
*  He was trying to build intelligent robots. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=919.54s)]
*  And he was talking about intelligence, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=922.14s)]
*  And his wife, who's a neuroscientist, says, you're an idiot. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=925.1s)]
*  I'm outside and let me show you something. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=928.54s)]
*  So they go outside and she's like, show me everything with a brain and everything that [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=930.0999999999999s)]
*  doesn't have a brain out in the garden in the woods. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=933.74s)]
*  And he's like, well, I don't know. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=938.0999999999999s)]
*  Like this squirrel has a brain. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=939.3399999999999s)]
*  And she said, it's really simple. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=941.14s)]
*  Anything that moves around in the world has a brain. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=943.3s)]
*  Anything that doesn't move around in the world, like a tree doesn't really, it may have a [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=946.18s)]
*  nervous system, except, but it doesn't have a brain in the classical sense. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=949.06s)]
*  It seems we've evolved brains purely to adapt to moving around in physical space. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=952.3199999999999s)]
*  There's an amazing animal called a sea squirt, which in its larval stage moves around the [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=957.9s)]
*  ground and filter and moves around catching things, et cetera, and has a brain. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=962.1800000000001s)]
*  Then when it graduates to being an adult, it plants itself on a rock and it filter feeds [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=966.62s)]
*  from then on. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=971.82s)]
*  Like a lawyer. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=972.82s)]
*  And the first thing it does when it plants itself, it eats its own brain. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=973.82s)]
*  Like a lawyer. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=978.46s)]
*  It eats its own brain. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=980.26s)]
*  And now it never needs a brain anymore. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=981.78s)]
*  So it turns out to have a brain, the reason we have brains is to move around in the physical [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=983.62s)]
*  domain. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=988.62s)]
*  It's a great distinction. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=989.62s)]
*  There's a lot of individuals who feel like we don't have full on AI until we embody [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=991.7s)]
*  AIs into physical robots. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=996.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1000.22s)]
*  Now there's lots of ways of doing it. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1001.22s)]
*  Like if I had a robot that I was kind of transporting into or bridging into, and I could move with [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1002.58s)]
*  my horns, like the Avatar X Prize thing that you had. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1009.14s)]
*  There's models like that. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1014.3000000000001s)]
*  There's other models where... [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1015.5s)]
*  Now I did get very excited when we first saw the Baxter robot. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1018.5s)]
*  I remember Baxter. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1023.3000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1024.3s)]
*  Now I got super excited for a specific thing because I have a computer science software [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1025.3s)]
*  development background. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1028.26s)]
*  If you used to program an industrial robot to say, pick up a widget, turn 90 degrees, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1029.8600000000001s)]
*  move over here, turn back, put it down type of thing, you had to program every step in [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1034.22s)]
*  the path and it took a long time. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1038.02s)]
*  Hundreds of instructions just to do this little thing. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1040.5s)]
*  With Baxter, you could move its arms and show it what to do, stock picking, whatever, and [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1044.3000000000002s)]
*  it would then go, oh, I get it, and it would just do its own thing. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1047.7800000000002s)]
*  I thought that was a massive step change, which is roughly what you're referencing here. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1050.7s)]
*  It's actually a step further here. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1054.46s)]
*  For example, Tesla, earlier in 23, announced that they had replaced 300,000 lines of computer [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1055.94s)]
*  code in C++ with 3,000 lines of a large language model. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1064.8200000000002s)]
*  Basically, they used all of the self-driving data to train a model to look for the potholes, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1070.9s)]
*  look for this, look for that, and do it. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1078.5400000000002s)]
*  It's doing amazingly well. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1080.94s)]
*  Full credit, yes, Elon was six years off from what he promised, but it's getting there. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1084.22s)]
*  It's happening. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1090.5400000000002s)]
*  I'm excited. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1091.5400000000002s)]
*  I would like to see the... [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1094.22s)]
*  For me, it feels like the use cases are not clear for why you need it. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1095.82s)]
*  Dude, I totally disagree. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1101.6200000000001s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1102.6200000000001s)]
*  Let me give you one last anecdote. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1103.6200000000001s)]
*  I remember Boston Dynamics had this robot horse. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1104.98s)]
*  I remember that. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1109.42s)]
*  It was called Big Dog. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1110.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1111.42s)]
*  It was amazing watching this thing. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1112.42s)]
*  The iterations of it was fantastic. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1113.42s)]
*  It was a pack animal. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1114.42s)]
*  It was a pack animal. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1115.42s)]
*  It was a military. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1116.42s)]
*  It was a pack animal. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1117.42s)]
*  It cost $300,000, $400,000 for this thing. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1118.42s)]
*  Everybody asked Brad Templeton, what do you think of that? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1123.18s)]
*  He was like, great, but if I wanted a horse, I'd get a male horse and a female horse. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1125.02s)]
*  I'd breed a horse at almost zero cost. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1128.66s)]
*  Give it a bit of hay, and you've got a horse. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1132.26s)]
*  Why do you need to build a robot horse? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1134.3400000000001s)]
*  For me, this feels like when we move from radio to TV, the first thing that people did [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1140.38s)]
*  was read radio scripts on television because they didn't have the imagination to have TV [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1145.7s)]
*  series and sitcoms and drama series and do acting. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1151.3799999999999s)]
*  For me, it feels like we've moved into, okay, we have humanoid robots. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1155.1s)]
*  Let's do what human beings are doing. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1159.94s)]
*  I think we could use humanoid robots to do stuff that we aren't able to do or don't want [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1161.54s)]
*  to do or shouldn't be doing. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1165.82s)]
*  Dan Barry used to say, do things that are dull, dangerous, or dirty with robots. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1166.82s)]
*  I got it. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1170.94s)]
*  I think we're going to see a new generation of robots and figures amazing, optimists, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1172.8999999999999s)]
*  especially Gen 2, I think is extraordinary. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1179.26s)]
*  Let me just show you this video of Gen 2. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1182.58s)]
*  This came out in December of 23. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1185.14s)]
*  Let's roll the video. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1188.46s)]
*  Not bad, humanoid robots. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1192.1000000000001s)]
*  It can be your workout coach here. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1193.1000000000001s)]
*  If it can do my workout for me, that's when I'm happy. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1196.78s)]
*  Listen, I wanted to just cook me my omelet every morning here. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1199.82s)]
*  The precision here is pretty extraordinary. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1205.6200000000001s)]
*  By the way, that, I just want to just on the other side of the argument, that little thing [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1209.22s)]
*  of picking up an egg and knowing how much pressure to put on the egg to move it, it's [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1213.6599999999999s)]
*  a huge, huge break point. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1217.86s)]
*  The other one that I remember, I think, hearing about the big challenge is proprioception. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1219.8999999999999s)]
*  If you close your eyes, it's very easy to go touch your nose. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1226.5s)]
*  You instinctively, your brain knows where you are in the three-dimensional space and [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1229.22s)]
*  you can do it blindfolded. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1232.82s)]
*  A robot has a very difficult time with that. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1234.3799999999999s)]
*  However, generative AI built into the robots and leveraging it, I think, is a game changer. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1237.7s)]
*  I still don't understand. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1242.54s)]
*  Let me share. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1244.38s)]
*  Let me tell you. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1245.38s)]
*  First of all, again, Elon's numbers, Elon's timeline, which is- [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1246.38s)]
*  If you ignore the timeline. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1252.38s)]
*  He calls me the most optimistic person in the world. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1253.38s)]
*  I would say he's the most optimistic on timelines and cost. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1255.1000000000001s)]
*  His number here is $20,000 per optimist robot. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1262.22s)]
*  Let's call it $50,000. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1267.9s)]
*  What does it cost you to lease a $50,000 car? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1270.18s)]
*  Very little. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1273.42s)]
*  A few hundred a month. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1274.42s)]
*  Call it 500 a month. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1275.42s)]
*  Imagine you've got this in your closet for 500 bucks a month. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1277.82s)]
*  What is that? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1281.34s)]
*  $20 a day to clean up the house while you're gone, mow the lawn, prepare lunch for lunch [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1282.34s)]
*  and dinner for you. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1292.22s)]
*  I don't want to go to the notion of free labor, but it's effectively free labor. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1293.8200000000002s)]
*  Why humanoid robots? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1301.94s)]
*  First of all, anything that becomes really good, like a robot that cleans dishes, we [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1304.26s)]
*  call a dishwasher, or a dryer, or a washing machine. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1309.02s)]
*  A humanoid robot, we live in a human world. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1315.3s)]
*  The door knob over there, the accelerator in your car, the steps we go through, the [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1318.34s)]
*  size of the doors. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1323.7s)]
*  Being able to navigate our physical world by a humanoid robot. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1325.7s)]
*  I want one, maybe two. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1332.42s)]
*  Clean up after me, cook my meals, do the stuff I want. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1335.74s)]
*  I think there are a million uses. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1342.66s)]
*  I'll tell you what my inflection point threshold is for me. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1346.02s)]
*  When you have a robot that you can say, go tidy up the kitchen. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1351.18s)]
*  It can go and put the dishes or ins and off, put them in the dishwasher, put the salt and [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1355.0600000000002s)]
*  pepper away, put away the various appliances you've taken out, etc. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1359.94s)]
*  Do that reasonably, completely. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1365.5800000000002s)]
*  That's a repetitive task. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1367.8200000000002s)]
*  Once you learn how to do it, it's not that hard. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1369.38s)]
*  That I think is a game changer. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1372.0600000000002s)]
*  I'll give you another application. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1373.3400000000001s)]
*  I think we're going to be there because you can have that robot walk into the kitchen [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1375.02s)]
*  and say, this is a state of clean. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1379.18s)]
*  Look around, memorize where every single thing goes. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1381.94s)]
*  Open every drawer, look in it. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1386.54s)]
*  Photographic memory, it's there. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1388.54s)]
*  Then return this kitchen to a state of clean. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1391.7s)]
*  Let me flip around to your side of the argument for a second. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1395.58s)]
*  I'll give you a couple of areas where I think it'll be monstrously useful in a house. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1398.7s)]
*  Where did I put that damn little pair of pliers? [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1403.46s)]
*  I don't think you need a robot for that. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1406.14s)]
*  The robot will know that. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1407.46s)]
*  No, but that's an AI. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1409.26s)]
*  That's Jarvis and cameras that happen to notice where your things are. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1411.9s)]
*  Go get it for me. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1415.66s)]
*  That's not a problem. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1416.66s)]
*  Okay, go get it for me. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1417.66s)]
*  Sure. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1418.66s)]
*  I'll give you another one. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1419.66s)]
*  Go walk the dogs. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1420.66s)]
*  I think that would be awesome. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1421.66s)]
*  A dog walking robot is going to be coming very quickly. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1422.66s)]
*  I think that can be done very soon. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1424.74s)]
*  I pay my dog walker much more than 20 bucks an hour. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1426.26s)]
*  I think there's some areas, but I still think there's some cost-effective areas. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1430.26s)]
*  I think the vast majority of really powerful applications will be construction. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1437.7s)]
*  Go build a house and a swarm of these robots. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1443.62s)]
*  By the way, I disagree with the fact that it should be humanoid. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1446.58s)]
*  There's all sorts of inefficiencies with being humanoid. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1449.22s)]
*  Why are we building that into the day robot? [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1452.62s)]
*  I think it's going to be a multitude. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1453.62s)]
*  It's going to be Star Wars. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1456.42s)]
*  I'd rather see an octopus spidery thing because then it can navigate lots of environments. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1459.7s)]
*  Of course. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1463.3400000000001s)]
*  Some will fly. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1464.3400000000001s)]
*  It'll have eight arms. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1465.3400000000001s)]
*  It can do lots of things. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1466.3400000000001s)]
*  It can do it super fast. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1467.3400000000001s)]
*  I'd prefer it not to be humanoid. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1468.3400000000001s)]
*  Well, I'm sorry. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1469.3400000000001s)]
*  We're going to have humanoid robots and I want data. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1470.3400000000001s)]
*  Okay, so let's talk about humanoid robots one second. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1472.38s)]
*  We've got Terminator. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1475.9s)]
*  Don't want those. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1476.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1477.9s)]
*  Data, C3PO. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1478.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1479.9s)]
*  What's your favorite robot? [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1480.9s)]
*  Probably data. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1485.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1486.18s)]
*  Any others? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1487.18s)]
*  Positronic brain. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1488.18s)]
*  Sure. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1489.66s)]
*  If I only had a brain. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1490.66s)]
*  C3PO for me is too fanciful or too much personality in it. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1494.26s)]
*  Do you have one? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1502.46s)]
*  Data for sure, but growing up, you were lost in space. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1505.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1510.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1511.26s)]
*  Robot, that was his name. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1512.26s)]
*  Very imaginative robot. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1513.26s)]
*  I loved robot from Lost in Space. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1515.22s)]
*  I remember just build those with things from the dryers and boxes and so forth. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1518.6200000000001s)]
*  It was fun. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1526.02s)]
*  Everybody, I want to take a short break from our episode to talk about a company that's [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1527.02s)]
*  very important to me and could actually save your life or the life of someone that you [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1529.98s)]
*  love. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1535.1000000000001s)]
*  The company is called Fountain Life. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1536.1000000000001s)]
*  It's a company I started years ago with Tony Robbins and a group of very talented physicians. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1537.1000000000001s)]
*  Most of us don't actually know what's going on inside our body. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1544.02s)]
*  We're all optimists. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1548.54s)]
*  Until that day where you have a pain in your side, you go to the physician in the emergency [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1549.54s)]
*  room and they say, listen, I'm sorry to tell you this, but you have this stage three or [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1553.58s)]
*  four going on. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1557.8600000000001s)]
*  It didn't start that morning. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1560.1200000000001s)]
*  It probably was a problem that's been going on for some time, but because we never look, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1562.02s)]
*  we don't find out. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1567.56s)]
*  What we built at Fountain Life was the world's most advanced diagnostic centers. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1569.44s)]
*  We have four across the U.S. today and we're building 20 around the world. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1574.56s)]

*  at the very beginning when it's solvable. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1603.16s)]

*  I think there's something magical about a humanoid robot and I want to show you another [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1667.1599999999999s)]
*  humanoid robot here. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1672.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1673.32s)]
*  Actually, here's Tesla again doing something useful. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1674.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1676.28s)]
*  Like, you know, folding my shirt. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1677.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1679.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1680.24s)]
*  Now, this is pretty amazing. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1681.24s)]
*  The ability to actually understand where the edges are. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1682.6s)]
*  I remember Scott Hasson who had Willow Garage and he built a robot to fold laundry. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1687.04s)]
*  It was just extraordinarily difficult. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1698.52s)]
*  It did it. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1702.12s)]
*  Yeah, it was really slow. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1703.12s)]
*  It was really slow and really painful and detecting the edges and where to pick it up [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1704.12s)]
*  and a whole model of how a cloth folds. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1708.84s)]
*  I mean, it's crazy. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1711.84s)]
*  So I'll flip to where I think this robot is really powerful. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1713.92s)]
*  They now have a stitching robot. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1718.2s)]
*  Sure. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1720.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1721.2s)]
*  We have a trillion dollars of the global economy of people sewing t-shirts together and clothes [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1722.2s)]
*  together and jeans together, etc. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1728.48s)]
*  And it's really horrible work and it's low paid. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1731.48s)]
*  It's very difficult. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1735.5600000000002s)]
*  Child labor in a lot of cases in dodgy countries. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1736.5600000000002s)]
*  I agree. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1739.44s)]
*  And you have this sewing robot that just does it all. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1740.44s)]
*  I think things like that are where the game changes. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1743.08s)]
*  Agricultural application. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1745.64s)]
*  How about surgery? [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1746.92s)]
*  Surgery is huge. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1749.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1750.0s)]
*  So I've said this before and I say this to all my friends who are in medical school or [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1751.0s)]
*  physicians. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1754.88s)]
*  It's like, listen, the best diagnosticians will be AIs and the best surgeons will be [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1755.88s)]
*  AIs. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1760.28s)]
*  So let me ask you this. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1761.28s)]
*  Do you know the question if you need to get a surgeon for any procedure? [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1762.28s)]
*  And hopefully you don't. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1767.24s)]
*  But if you do someday, there is one question you ask when interviewing a surgeon. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1768.24s)]
*  Do you know what it is? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1772.0s)]
*  How many of these have you done in the past? [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1773.0s)]
*  How many of them did you do this morning? [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1775.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1777.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1778.12s)]
*  So in other words, the surgeon who has the most experience with a particular procedure [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1779.12s)]
*  is the most, you know, is trained his or her neural net to see every arterial venous [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1783.84s)]
*  malformation. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1790.28s)]
*  Every situation is prepared for everything. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1791.5s)]
*  And it's really, it's you want someone who's done 80 of them a week. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1794.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1798.0s)]
*  I want you to imagine a future in which these robots are our future surgeons. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1799.3999999999999s)]
*  And every time a robot does one, it's uploading its experience to the cloud. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1804.72s)]
*  And every surgical robot has had every experience, it's seen millions of them. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1811.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1816.28s)]
*  So now this is where things get interesting for me, right? [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1817.28s)]
*  This is the same thing with the Tesla car. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1819.9199999999998s)]
*  Once it knows to navigate a pothole and tells every other Tesla car to do that, now things [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1822.36s)]
*  get really interesting because you get a distributed intelligence that can be applied, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1827.28s)]
*  learn once and apply a million times. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1832.68s)]
*  And I think if you have somebody who's done a hundred heart replacements a month, a surgeon, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1835.06s)]
*  and you have a robot, a camera just watching over that with the generative AI built in, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1841.92s)]
*  the robot will be able to do the same thing very quickly. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1847.08s)]
*  And that's super exciting. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1849.44s)]
*  So you mentioned the uncanny valley before, which is a term that's typically applied to [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1851.5s)]
*  how human-like we make a robot's face look. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1858.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1862.06s)]
*  So what that means is when you see an animation of a human face, right? [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1863.06s)]
*  Because we're so attuned to human faces, our brains... [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1867.02s)]
*  We have a whole bunch of neurons dedicated. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1869.34s)]
*  We have a million brains to detect, et cetera. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1870.5s)]
*  It turns out like seeing a cartoon face is easy, but making it visibly real to the point [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1873.66s)]
*  where you think it's real is near impossible. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1878.62s)]
*  So the uncanny valley is a robot that we think is human. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1881.86s)]
*  And that I think is like a Turing test for visual robotics. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1885.46s)]
*  And can you detect that or not? [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1890.1799999999998s)]
*  So this is a robot, Amica, who's been on my stage at the Abundance Summit. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1891.9199999999998s)]
*  Amica's coming back this year in 2024. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1898.98s)]
*  I keep on wanting to say her. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1903.74s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's a she in a sense. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1911.06s)]
*  Is it? [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1913.5s)]
*  I mean, why? [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1914.5s)]
*  It's gray, it has no hair. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1915.5s)]
*  I mean, anyway, I'm going to say her. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1917.42s)]
*  We can barely classify humans right now. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1922.82s)]
*  It's probably safer to go. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1927.18s)]
*  My pronouns are it. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1928.74s)]
*  All right. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1931.62s)]
*  So check out, check this out. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1932.62s)]
*  So this is a video of Amica seeing herself in the mirror for the first time. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1934.3799999999999s)]
*  OK. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1940.7s)]
*  Has she been told that that's her in the mirror? [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1947.86s)]
*  I have no idea what the setup is. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1950.7s)]
*  OK. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1953.02s)]
*  But it's amazing. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1953.52s)]
*  I think she has like 23 servo motors in her face alone. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1962.32s)]
*  I wanted to wink at the end there. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1967.36s)]
*  That's freaky. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1968.84s)]
*  It is freaky. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1969.84s)]
*  And so here we have a humanoid robot that, for me, would be meeting me at the entryway [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1970.8799999999999s)]
*  some place, would be my guest service manager, would work the front desk at a hotel. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1978.88s)]
*  I think that's pretty extraordinary. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1987.1200000000001s)]
*  And by the way, when you see Amica at the Abundance Summit this year, at A360, she's [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=1990.8400000000001s)]
*  powered by GPT-4. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2001.24s)]
*  Yep. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2002.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2003.24s)]
*  When you have a conversation with her, you're having a conversation with a large language [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2004.24s)]
*  model. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2009.64s)]
*  OK. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2010.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2011.64s)]
*  I want some. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2012.64s)]
*  I'm looking forward to having some humanoid robots in my life. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2014.16s)]
*  I think this is, again, one of those fun to play with. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2017.88s)]
*  But I think there will be enormous power in various activities that can get done. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2020.44s)]
*  For example, if you had a robot like this as a reception check-in, a hotel check-in, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2026.04s)]
*  They will process white collar drudgery. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2032.08s)]
*  Like, OK, I want a king's room. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2034.52s)]
*  I registered for a book for this, but do you have one of these free? [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2036.96s)]
*  And I arrived early and do you have a room available, etc.? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2040.12s)]
*  They'll be able to handle that stuff very fast. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2042.6s)]
*  Whereas today is super slow and takes a long time. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2045.6799999999998s)]
*  And they'll be able to do a lot more effective. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2048.48s)]
*  They'll process many more guests at a time per hour type of thing. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2051.6s)]
*  I think that's where things will become really interesting around this. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2055.48s)]
*  But I still don't see the need for it to be humanoid. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2058.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, sex bots. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2060.48s)]
*  I mean, you can imagine there's going to be a market for that. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2062.8s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2066.28s)]
*  And in that case, you want to look at the show. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2067.52s)]
*  I mean, there already is. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2068.92s)]
*  The one that blows my mind is this phenomenon in Japan where men walk around with blow up sex [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2070.32s)]
*  and blow up women figurines dolls just for companionship. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2076.36s)]
*  And no wonder the reproductive race is so long. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2082.04s)]
*  It's very surreal. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2085.2400000000002s)]
*  But it's just a thing over there. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2086.84s)]
*  Just a thing. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2089.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2089.88s)]
*  So this blew me away. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2091.56s)]
*  This was an article that came out on the prediction of how many bipedal humanoid robots we'll have. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2094.0s)]
*  And so the prediction I heard from the team at Figure is single digit millions by 2030. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2101.04s)]
*  And in the 2040s, Elon came out with his prediction of a billion by 2040. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2111.4s)]
*  OK. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2119.7599999999998s)]
*  And potentially 10 billion by the end of the 2040s. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2120.3599999999997s)]
*  So imagine a world with more humanoid robots than humans. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2128.12s)]
*  This is like the equivalent of we have more chip neural power than human neural power. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2131.4s)]
*  And we have more cell phones than we have humans on the planet right now. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2136.7599999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2140.48s)]
*  So I think I go back to the use cases. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2142.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2144.8s)]
*  I think the number is not that relevant, but I think the use cases is fascinating. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2145.32s)]
*  So if you can have a rice picking robot that goes and tends the rice fields or in this case picks things [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2149.48s)]
*  or picks lettuce or strawberry or whatever and takes away that drudgery from human beings, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2155.96s)]
*  I think that is a game changer in some profound ways. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2162.76s)]
*  But I think we're kind of almost all the way there. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2166.32s)]
*  We have many, many areas where Apple picking is now done largely by robots, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2168.3599999999997s)]
*  And I think that where it doesn't have to be humanoid robot. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2175.7999999999997s)]
*  No, and we have in Amazon service stations and so on. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2178.6s)]
*  I mean, I think the automation of labor is I think the one thing that we found most surprising [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2183.64s)]
*  is when we're looking at automation and robotics and AI, we thought manual labor would be automated first. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2190.64s)]
*  White collar labor automated later. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2197.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2199.7999999999997s)]
*  And this is another one of those areas was really, really hard to be a futurist because chat GPT comes out. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2200.2s)]
*  All of a sudden, white collar thinking is totally automated. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2205.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2208.52s)]
*  And it's way harder to do the manual labor because of the physical dexterity stuff. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2208.9199999999996s)]
*  So I'm excited by the robot revolution. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2214.12s)]
*  I think it's farther away than most people think. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2216.04s)]
*  Certainly farther away than you want. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2218.68s)]
*  Okay. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2221.3999999999996s)]
*  These robots will be in production in 2025 and they'll be sold and they will be put into limited use cases. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2222.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2232.36s)]
*  And I think we're going to start to see them as they learn. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2233.8s)]
*  The thing I remember, and this is where having a conversation with Ray the other day, Ray Kurzweil, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2240.92s)]
*  and we both hit on the same thing that we tend to make linear our future extrapolations [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2246.04s)]
*  even though we're faced with this amazing exponential growth. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2255.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2258.44s)]
*  Right? [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2258.92s)]
*  So listen, if we've got what I'll again term AGI, artificial general intelligence by 2029, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2259.24s)]
*  driving these robots, these robots are doing anything and everything. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2267.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2271.16s)]
*  In which case, if they can do anything and everything, even if they're $100,000 a robot [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2271.88s)]
*  or quarter million dollars a robot, we're going to have a lot of them. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2276.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2280.28s)]
*  They're not limited by physical manifestation. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2280.6s)]
*  They're limited by the intelligence to have them do things that are useful. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2283.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2287.6400000000003s)]
*  True. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2288.92s)]
*  I think you will have a corresponding concern around regulatory and safety. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2289.32s)]
*  Right? [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2295.32s)]
*  What could possibly go wrong? [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2295.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, if I can tell my humanoid robot go steal something from that house. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2296.92s)]
*  And figure out a way of getting into the house and go get stuff from the house. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2302.44s)]
*  How do you navigate that? [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2306.6800000000003s)]
*  Those? [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2307.88s)]
*  We're back to the general concerns of AI. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2308.92s)]
*  Right? [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2311.56s)]
*  It comes back to ethics and morals and dystopian uses. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2312.12s)]
*  But it's so interesting. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2316.28s)]
*  We're here in Santa Monica recording this. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2320.12s)]
*  And did you see the Cocoa robots on the streets here at all? [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2322.36s)]
*  The delivery robots? [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2326.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2327.1600000000003s)]
*  So it's fascinating. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2327.88s)]
*  Right? [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2329.32s)]
*  So these little six-wheeled robots with a little antenna and little headlights. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2329.48s)]
*  And I think they're manually driven or they're manually assisted. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2335.0s)]
*  They're like some AI plus somebody in somewhere in the world deciding whether to cross the [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2341.08s)]
*  street or not. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2346.28s)]
*  But the first time you see them, it's like, wow, that's amazing. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2347.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2350.84s)]
*  Look at that delivery robot. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2351.2400000000002s)]
*  You take photos up and so forth. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2352.28s)]
*  And then a week later, it's like boring. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2353.72s)]
*  It's back to that conversation about how quickly we normalize these things. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2356.6s)]
*  Right? [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2361.3199999999997s)]
*  And I think the way to do this is to pick some value-added use case that allows people [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2361.56s)]
*  to get used to them. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2370.04s)]
*  And then it'll spread. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2370.8399999999997s)]
*  Then they'll take over and be used for lots of other things. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2371.7999999999997s)]
*  All right. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2374.44s)]
*  Well, I think I'm going to surprise you with this prediction that we're going to have a [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2374.68s)]
*  billion robots. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2383.08s)]
*  And you should listen to this. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2384.2s)]
*  I didn't listen to you in 2011 when you were like, Bitcoin, Peter, Bitcoin, 2011. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2386.2s)]
*  You should have forced me, dude. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2391.64s)]
*  Dude, I didn't buy it either. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2392.92s)]
*  So I watched Bitcoin go from $0.05 to $0.50 to $5 to $50. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2395.16s)]
*  Finally, at $500, I bought a bunch. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2401.48s)]
*  And that was hard when you first saw it at $0.05 to go, I'm spending $500 on this thing [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2404.3599999999997s)]
*  that costs $0.05. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2409.88s)]
*  I think that's a very difficult thing to overcome. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2410.8399999999997s)]
*  And then you have to just go, if I was coming at it blank, what would I do? [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2417.3199999999997s)]
*  If we've got billions of these robots walking around, we're going to need battery power. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2422.2s)]
*  So two articles come out that were amazing. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2428.12s)]
*  There's been a whole debate and discussion about, do we have enough lithium to power [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2433.08s)]
*  the cars? [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2438.52s)]
*  And will we have enough for robots? [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2439.32s)]
*  So this was interesting. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2441.72s)]
*  So this is the first mass produced EV with sodium ion batteries. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2443.16s)]
*  Gets 250 kilometers. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2448.52s)]
*  So new battery chemistries. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2450.6s)]
*  One of the things people forget is that scarcity drives innovation and reinvention. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2452.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2459.0s)]
*  And this is a really, I remember this conversation for me, the penny dropped when we first came [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2460.2s)]
*  across CRISPR, which is a biotech capability of programming your genome. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2467.16s)]
*  Editing your genome. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2471.72s)]
*  And people tried to patent it. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2472.7599999999998s)]
*  And then people thought, oh my God, if it's patented, there'll be da da da da. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2475.08s)]
*  And very quickly, researchers found like five other mechanisms to achieve the same thing. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2478.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2483.24s)]
*  Right? [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2483.56s)]
*  And when I first turned in, I've watched the people complaining about lithium ion forever [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2484.04s)]
*  and complaining about China hoarding all the rare earths, et cetera. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2488.52s)]
*  I've never been worried about it. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2492.04s)]
*  I've always figured, I'm an engineer around. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2494.3599999999997s)]
*  We don't have enough. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2496.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2497.4s)]
*  We'll engineer around that. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2498.0400000000004s)]
*  Or we'll find other compounds that do the same thing. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2499.48s)]
*  Or we'll kind of create different models for how to do this. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2502.6000000000004s)]
*  And something will happen. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2506.1200000000003s)]
*  And this is, for me, validation of that type of thing, where we are going to completely [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2507.5600000000004s)]
*  blow the lid off energy storage in the next decade. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2512.76s)]
*  And I think that, for me, is an absolute game changer. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2516.2000000000003s)]
*  Well, here's an amazing story. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2519.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2523.0800000000004s)]
*  This is a tweet from Beth Jeyzos. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2523.9s)]
*  Real name is Gil Verdon. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2529.98s)]
*  And he'll be on stage. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2531.98s)]
*  He runs Effective Accelerationism. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2533.2599999999998s)]
*  And he's just a brilliant. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2538.46s)]
*  He used to be working with Sergey Brin at Google in quantum. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2539.74s)]
*  And he is in the boomer to doomer scale. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2544.14s)]
*  He's like the extreme on boomers. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2547.34s)]
*  We have to go as fast as possible. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2549.74s)]
*  And this is this tweet. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2552.2200000000003s)]
*  And he says, we're so fucking back. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2554.3s)]
*  So this is a tweet from the US Department of Energy that confirmed a discovery of [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2556.78s)]
*  3,400 kiloton reserve of lithium in California's Salton Sea, [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2563.82s)]
*  making one of the largest exploitable lithium deposits in the world. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2568.94s)]
*  So for the last 10 years, it's like, oh my god, running out of lithium, it's not enough lithium. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2572.2200000000003s)]
*  And this is the abundance thesis. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2576.3s)]
*  It is. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2578.78s)]
*  That there is nothing truly scarce within the right context. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2579.34s)]
*  It goes into the same thing around technology and energy scarcity. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2584.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2588.94s)]
*  We were worried about, oh my god, limiting oil reserves. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2589.42s)]
*  And then technology came across, figured out fracking. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2592.1400000000003s)]
*  And that expanded radically the scope of it. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2595.26s)]
*  The whole ability with technology, something like 40% of oil discoveries today are AI driven. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2599.82s)]
*  Wow. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2607.6600000000003s)]
*  40% of oil discovery. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2608.7999999999997s)]
*  Right? [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2611.2s)]
*  That's kind of massive. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2611.44s)]
*  And that's a game changer in this. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2612.7999999999997s)]
*  I think there's hundreds of these examples we're going to come across. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2614.3999999999996s)]
*  And it's not even. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2617.68s)]
*  So I'll give you one of my other favorites. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2618.7999999999997s)]
*  There's a project called the Materials Project. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2620.72s)]
*  Materials Genome? [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2624.3199999999997s)]
*  Materials Project. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2625.2799999999997s)]
*  OK. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2626.48s)]
*  Saul Griffith talked about this at one of our sessions. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2627.2s)]
*  And what they've done is put together a database of about a million compounds [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2629.92s)]
*  and cataloged in great detail the chemical, electrical, and physical properties of these compounds. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2635.68s)]
*  And these are multiple minerals. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2640.08s)]
*  Lithium ion and different molecules, different material compounds. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2642.8799999999997s)]
*  Right? [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2647.44s)]
*  Now, this goes to the linear to exponential thing. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2648.0s)]
*  If you're a battery researcher and you're trying to figure out, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2650.72s)]
*  OK, what's an alternative to lithium ion? [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2653.44s)]
*  Well, OK, maybe sodium ion. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2655.3599999999997s)]
*  So you run some experiments and you find, OK, that does or doesn't work. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2656.72s)]
*  Maybe it's lithium air. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2660.08s)]
*  Maybe it's lithium this. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2661.52s)]
*  And you test sequentially compound after compound. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2662.96s)]
*  Very linear approach. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2665.6s)]
*  Very linear. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2666.56s)]
*  And you may fail at each time. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2667.12s)]
*  And you don't know when you're going to succeed. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2668.88s)]
*  It's the way Edison did it with his light bulbs. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2670.48s)]
*  Now you can go to his database and go, OK, give me a compound that meets this voltage [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2672.88s)]
*  and this thermal resistance and this retention. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2676.8s)]
*  And boom, it'll say these are the five that meet your needs. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2679.44s)]
*  I call that the materials genome. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2682.7200000000003s)]
*  And the concept I had on my stage at Abundance, the head of applied materials. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2684.8s)]
*  Amazing company, right? [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2690.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2691.76s)]
*  So first of all, I think material science is like the most underappreciated field in [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2692.0s)]
*  technology. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2697.92s)]
*  It's like all the progress we have as a result of new breakthroughs in materials. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2698.64s)]
*  Yeah, huge. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2703.36s)]
*  Huge. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2704.32s)]
*  Like another era. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2704.8s)]
*  If you want to be, you know, material science is amazing. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2705.6s)]
*  Course two at MIT, but never went there. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2708.64s)]
*  No, it wasn't course two. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2712.72s)]
*  Damn it. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2713.68s)]
*  What was it? [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2714.0s)]
*  Anyway, long story short, the materials genome was being able, once you know, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2714.56s)]
*  like in a Sudoku board, once you know the properties of different, you can start to [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2720.8s)]
*  extrapolate what materials that have never been made might have the properties of. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2725.1200000000003s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2729.84s)]
*  And that is extraordinary. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2730.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2732.32s)]
*  And now you can then design those. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2732.88s)]
*  So I think what's going to happen now is you let a generative AI loose on the materials [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2734.48s)]
*  database, which is open source and free, by the way, the materials project. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2738.56s)]
*  And let's start thinking about that and say what alternative do I have for this or this [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2742.6400000000003s)]
*  or this? [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2746.88s)]
*  That's a game changer for materials research. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2747.52s)]
*  That changes the game. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2749.52s)]
*  Again, another level of. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2751.28s)]
*  Hey everyone. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2752.64s)]
*  I want to take a quick break from this episode to tell you about a health product that I [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2753.52s)]
*  love and that I use every day. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2757.52s)]
*  In fact, I use it twice a day. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2760.0s)]
*  It's Seed DSO-1 Daily Symbiotic. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2762.32s)]
*  Hopefully by now you understand that your microbiome and your gut health are one of [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2765.68s)]
*  the most important modifiable parts of your health. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2769.84s)]
*  Your gut microbiome is connected to everything. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2772.72s)]
*  Your brain health, your cardiac health, your metabolic health. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2775.28s)]
*  So the question is, what are you doing to optimize your gut? [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2778.48s)]
*  Let me take a moment to tell you about what I'm doing. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2781.36s)]
*  Every day I take two capsules of Seed DSO-1 Daily Symbiotic. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2783.92s)]
*  It's a two in one probiotic and prebiotic formulation that supports digested health, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2788.88s)]
*  gut health, skin health, heart health, and more. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2794.7200000000003s)]
*  It contains 24 clinically and scientifically proven probiotic strains that are delivered [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2797.2000000000003s)]
*  in a patented capsule that actually protects the contents from your stomach acid and [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2802.88s)]
*  ensures that 100% of it is survivable, reaching your colon. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2808.24s)]
*  Now, if you want to try Seed DSO-1 Daily Symbiotic for yourself, you can get 25% off your first [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2812.24s)]

*  month of Seed's Daily Symbiotic. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2836.4s)]
*  Trust me, your gut will thank you. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2838.56s)]
*  All right, let's go back to the episode. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2840.7200000000003s)]
*  Here's another story that breaks this past week. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2842.8s)]
*  It's Neuralink and in particular, the ability to connect your neocortex, the outer layer [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2845.84s)]
*  of your brain to the cloud. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2854.48s)]
*  I'm going to show a couple of tweets from Elon and talk about those in a moment. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2856.48s)]
*  Ray Kurzweil has been talking about this forever. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2860.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2862.56s)]
*  Ray's prediction, if I remember correctly, is high bandwidth brain-computer interface [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2864.0800000000004s)]
*  by 2033. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2869.92s)]
*  That's like nine years out and I believe it. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2873.52s)]
*  Most people don't realize we're constantly bombarded by so much information, our optic [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2880.0s)]
*  nerve, our touch and hearing. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2887.36s)]
*  I think the number that I looked up earlier was 11 megabits per second of data coming [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2892.96s)]
*  into the brain. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2902.8s)]
*  The problem is our brain processes that at 60 bits per second. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2905.28s)]
*  It has to use all these filters to reduce the noise and this is why we're so geared [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2909.2000000000003s)]
*  to see certain things, facial. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2916.4s)]
*  We don't see much else. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2919.04s)]
*  Dangerous. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2919.92s)]
*  Our amygdala, for example, filters. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2922.32s)]
*  We're so inundated that we have to make very quick decisions and so anything dangerous [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2925.28s)]
*  goes to the amygdala and puts you on red alert. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2931.28s)]
*  As cautious as I am about making predictions about robots, I'm unbelievably excited about [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2935.84s)]
*  this because every percent increase, I can increase my brain processing power. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2942.88s)]
*  That's just a game changer in terms of the interfacing with various things. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2949.04s)]
*  The ability to think things into existence is going to be powerful. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2954.48s)]
*  We were talking about this earlier. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2959.04s)]
*  I could go, I really want a chair that has this type of a shape, and you let an AI design [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2960.48s)]
*  six versions of it and you go, I want that one. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2966.2400000000002s)]
*  And then a separate 3D printer goes off and goes off and builds the thing for you. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2968.4s)]
*  And you're done. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2972.64s)]
*  That's just amazing. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2973.52s)]
*  I think this is going to be a huge force multiplier for humanity. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2974.56s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2980.56s)]
*  The ability to have brain-computer interface, BCI, also brings us a lot of other things. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2983.2799999999997s)]
*  It brings us telepathy. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2991.8399999999997s)]
*  My ability to communicate with you. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2994.0s)]
*  Omniscience, able to know through the trillion sensors out there what's going on in the world. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=2997.1200000000003s)]
*  It is god-like powers if you connect your brain to the cloud. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3003.76s)]
*  I have a spiritual tilt to my thinking. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3009.28s)]
*  Of course, Buddha. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3011.76s)]
*  When you connect all the brains together via BCI, now you have a hive mind and you [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3014.4s)]
*  have a hive consciousness. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3020.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3021.44s)]
*  And that, I think, is really- [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3021.92s)]
*  That was my final chapter of Futures Fast, do you think? [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3023.2s)]
*  I call it a meta-intelligence. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3027.3599999999997s)]
*  Can I tell a story here? [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3029.2s)]
*  Sure. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3030.24s)]
*  So I think this is just a step in human evolution. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3031.04s)]
*  And the reason I believe it's a step in human evolution is I look back at time. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3036.7999999999997s)]
*  So if you look back three and a half billion years ago when life first came into existence [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3041.12s)]
*  on the planet, it was these very simple cells called prokaryotic cells. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3047.84s)]
*  They were bags of cytoplasm and they were not energy efficient. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3053.1200000000003s)]
*  They were not- the DNA was free-floating inside. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3058.1600000000003s)]
*  And over the course of a half a billion years, they went from these prokaryotes, [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3061.84s)]
*  what are called eukaryotes. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3066.7200000000003s)]
*  And the eukaryotic cells brought in mitochondria for processing energy. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3068.0s)]
*  They put a nuclear membrane and chromosomes for processing the information. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3072.88s)]
*  And they brought in endoplasmic reticulum and liposomes. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3077.12s)]
*  They brought in all of this tech inside the cell. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3080.64s)]
*  And so they became tech-enabled cells. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3083.8399999999997s)]
*  And then the next step was that they went from single cell to multicellular. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3086.4s)]
*  And then from multicellular to tissues and organs. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3091.92s)]
*  And then you and me, we have 30 trillion human cells. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3094.88s)]
*  You might have 35 trillion human cells. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3099.68s)]
*  I'm not calling you fat. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3102.24s)]
*  I'm just saying you're bigger than I am. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3103.2s)]
*  So the process has been that incorporating technology, [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3106.16s)]
*  going multicellular and then connecting to another higher level. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3112.16s)]
*  And so I see that happening right now, right? [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3118.16s)]
*  So we are the equivalent of those simple prokaryotic cells. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3120.0s)]
*  We're connecting this technology into ourselves. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3123.2799999999997s)]
*  And as soon as that gets connected, I connect with you and with a million other people. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3127.2s)]
*  And we become conscious at another level. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3132.96s)]
*  And I call that a meta-intelligence. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3134.8s)]
*  And it is making me one with the universe. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3136.2400000000002s)]
*  Now, here's where it gets interesting. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3138.4s)]
*  I wonder if we become conscious on a global level. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3141.1200000000003s)]
*  And then we look out in the universe and we see all these other meta-intelligences. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3145.6800000000003s)]
*  What sensors would we detect that with? [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3153.1200000000003s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3155.36s)]
*  I hope this one answers that. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3156.7400000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3158.58s)]
*  When you think about the paradox, where is everybody? [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3159.7000000000003s)]
*  I actually believe the most in this. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3169.78s)]
*  So just for people listening, if you run the numbers, the Drake equation, etc., [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3171.54s)]
*  there should be a million other intelligences out in the universe that have advanced things. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3176.9s)]
*  So why don't we see them? [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3181.1400000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3182.1s)]
*  That's the Fermi paradox. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3183.4s)]
*  And I believe the most in... [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3184.7599999999998s)]
*  There's a number of answers to it. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3186.2799999999997s)]
*  One is everybody else died out were the most advanced, or we can't detect them. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3187.72s)]
*  Or they didn't pass the great filter. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3191.88s)]
*  They had nuclear weapons. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3194.36s)]
*  They blew themselves up. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3195.48s)]
*  My favorite hypothesis is the transcension hypothesis. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3198.44s)]
*  I agree. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3201.72s)]
*  Which is you've gotten evolved enough that you have virtual reality to do everything. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3202.12s)]
*  You don't need to go out. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3206.52s)]
*  You go inwards. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3207.3199999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3208.04s)]
*  And therefore, you don't need to broadcast outwards. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3209.0s)]
*  We may find there's a billion of those types of things out there. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3211.4s)]
*  And we do broadcast outwards, but not intentionally and in a focused fashion. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3214.2000000000003s)]
*  But I do believe that as we are... [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3219.16s)]
*  We are going from evolution by natural selection, Darwinism, [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3225.7200000000003s)]
*  to evolution by human direction. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3230.2000000000003s)]
*  We are evolving into something brand new. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3232.04s)]
*  I mean, natural selection has been dead for quite a while. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3233.88s)]
*  True. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3237.08s)]
*  Because we've been farming species and guiding evolution for quite a while. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3237.8799999999997s)]
*  There's inflection points around all of that that I think are interesting. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3243.9599999999996s)]
*  For me, when you think about the evolution of the world, when... [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3247.48s)]
*  We talked last month about the multi-dimension other parallel universes. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3252.52s)]
*  Yeah, quantum computing. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3258.8399999999997s)]
*  For me, what will get interesting is when I can bridge between universes. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3259.64s)]
*  That's what will be interesting. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3264.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3265.64s)]
*  I think there are drugs that can do that for you. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3266.2s)]
*  There are drugs that can do this. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3267.7999999999997s)]
*  But the ability to sense the world in one time and the ability to process that, [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3272.12s)]
*  that collective consciousness is going to be essentially the Buddha. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3278.12s)]
*  That is the oneness. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3282.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3284.04s)]
*  You know the joke, right? [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3285.0s)]
*  The monk goes up to the street vendor in New York and says, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3287.3199999999997s)]
*  make me one with everything to the hot dog vendor. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3290.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3292.8399999999997s)]
*  All right. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3295.72s)]
*  So, Elon tweets out, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3296.2s)]
*  the first human received an implant from Neuralink yesterday and is recovering well. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3299.56s)]
*  Initial results show promising neuron spike detection. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3304.3599999999997s)]
*  At Abundance this year, I've got the surgeon who does all of Neuralink's implants. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3309.08s)]
*  Wow. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3316.6s)]
*  It was interesting. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3318.6s)]
*  I've done two podcasts with Elon. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3319.8799999999997s)]
*  One was a couple years ago. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3323.8799999999997s)]
*  One was early in 24. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3324.7599999999998s)]
*  We talked about when he was playing Pong against a macaque monkey [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3328.2799999999997s)]
*  that was drinking a banana smoothie and playing Pong with its brain. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3334.7599999999998s)]
*  That's crazy because where we're going to go is we're that game of playing Pong. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3340.52s)]
*  Because I mean, Pong was like the earliest video games that you and I played. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3345.64s)]
*  How far they come now. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3349.48s)]
*  So that same trajectory. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3350.52s)]
*  So you'll be plugged into some advanced Neuralink and playing a virtual world. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3353.3199999999997s)]
*  I mean, we're in a virtual world right now. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3361.0s)]
*  We'll be playing in a virtual world within our virtual world. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3362.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3365.16s)]
*  I have a question for you that you may have an answer to because you're closer to this. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3365.64s)]
*  Why do you have to have an invasive procedure to implant a BCI? [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3369.96s)]
*  So you don't wear a helmet that reads your neurons and then writes to your neurons? [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3374.84s)]
*  So it's resolution. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3379.0s)]
*  Your brain is wrapped in a material called a dura. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3382.44s)]
*  Your dura then has on top of it a skull and then your scalp. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3387.96s)]
*  If you're trying to read individual neurons, it's very difficult. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3392.1200000000003s)]
*  There are a lot of approaches. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3395.96s)]
*  So one other approach, another company I'm going to have this year [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3397.1600000000003s)]
*  because we're going to go into BCI at the Abundance Summit, [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3402.76s)]
*  is a company that puts not into your brain but under the dura, [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3406.6800000000003s)]
*  but on top of the brain, it puts these ultrasound, focused ultrasound and steerable ultrasound. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3413.5600000000004s)]
*  That's right. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3422.0400000000004s)]
*  That can go and actually stimulate individual neurons. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3422.5200000000004s)]
*  By the way, there was a story on 60 Minutes last weekend. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3428.44s)]
*  They use focused ultrasound to treat people that are addicted. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3432.52s)]
*  They were able with one treatment of focused ultrasound to treat and completely cure addiction. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3437.16s)]
*  That kind of stuff, I get super excited. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3444.2799999999997s)]
*  Here's where this company wants to go. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3446.12s)]
*  Imagine an app where if you have this implant in, [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3447.7999999999997s)]
*  fairly easy to put in, but an app that says, [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3452.7599999999998s)]
*  I want to go to sleep or I want to wake up or I want to feel good [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3456.44s)]
*  or I want to have energy. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3460.68s)]
*  I want a better tennis forehand. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3462.2799999999997s)]
*  That's going to come to you, but I think the earlier apps are going to be states of emotion. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3464.6s)]
*  The stuff that Neuralink is doing and there are other companies, BlackRock, [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3471.64s)]
*  there's another company run by a friend, Matt Angle called Paradromix. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3475.16s)]
*  They're in sheep right now and they could well be in humans very shortly. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3480.36s)]
*  They actually have much more, there are more advanced number of ways compared to Neuralink. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3485.56s)]
*  All of these companies, Paradromix and Neuralink, a surgeon puts in these small filaments [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3493.08s)]
*  that are going into the neocortex and they are able to read and write off of individual neurons. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3500.2s)]
*  It's not really individual neurons, it's groups of neurons. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3508.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's in small regions. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3510.52s)]
*  Even a thin wire is much, much bigger. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3513.0s)]
*  They put them over the motor cortex and over the sensory cortex and then you can [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3517.16s)]
*  control things, listen to things and such. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3521.48s)]
*  When we get the nanowires, that's totally going to be a game changer because they'll be [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3524.2s)]
*  atoms thick and you can put it anywhere. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3528.44s)]
*  There's another amazing tech. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3531.08s)]
*  This comes from Mary Lou Jepson. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3533.08s)]
*  Do you know Mary Lou? [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3534.36s)]
*  Yeah, Open Water. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3534.92s)]
*  Open Water. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3536.04s)]
*  Mary Lou, who's brilliant, [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3536.76s)]
*  got almighty. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3538.6s)]
*  She was at Facebook and at Google and at MIT and one laptop per child and she's one of [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3539.56s)]
*  our abundance members. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3547.16s)]
*  I love her. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3548.6s)]
*  She has built a technology that allows you to use red laser light, which penetrates skin [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3550.84s)]
*  and skull and able to use red laser light and ultrasound to actually target an individual [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3558.2s)]
*  neuron and stimulate that neuron to fire or be able to sense if there's a ruffle on the [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3568.28s)]
*  neuron surface of whether it's firing. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3575.88s)]
*  You can read and write on to individual neurons and that's amazing. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3577.48s)]
*  Do you remember that movie Brainstorm? [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3582.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's literally like that. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3585.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, so you put on a cap and can record memories and listen to memories. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3587.32s)]
*  Here's the point. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3591.4s)]
*  It's the point you just made. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3592.28s)]
*  The single most valuable thing that any country or any company has is the intelligence of [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3593.48s)]
*  its employees or its citizens. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3599.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3601.48s)]
*  And so if you've got technologies like Neuralink or Paradromix or Open Water or BlackRock, [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3603.0s)]
*  able to increase the intelligence of your individuals, I can think in Google, right? [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3610.92s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3617.7200000000003s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3618.9199999999996s)]
*  Where that goes, there's a spectrum of intelligence going to collective intelligence [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3622.2799999999997s)]
*  and then you get to collective consciousness. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3629.64s)]
*  Yes. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3631.64s)]
*  Now you get into a definition problem. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3632.3599999999997s)]
*  But that's where I think things become really interesting, aware at scale of what's happening [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3634.3599999999997s)]
*  in the world. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3638.9199999999996s)]
*  For me, one of the applications of this that I'm super excited about is implanting this [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3639.48s)]
*  into animals and then being able to talk to the animals. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3646.04s)]
*  Or at least feel and also feel what the animals say. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3648.84s)]
*  Now we have talked about at XPRIZE this year at Visionary, we talked about an AI that can [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3652.1200000000003s)]
*  translate between humans. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3659.2400000000002s)]
*  Those are a project in 2017 out of Sweden. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3660.92s)]
*  I don't know where it's at right now. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3663.32s)]
*  But they predicted by about now, they were using machine learning to understand dolphin [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3664.92s)]
*  language. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3671.2400000000002s)]
*  And they figured within five years they would be able to do it. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3672.1200000000003s)]
*  My response was I'm really not sure you want to hear what dolphins have to say. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3674.7599999999998s)]
*  But in general, that ability to then, because now when you can communicate with other species, [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3679.56s)]
*  that then things get interesting. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3689.56s)]
*  So forget the human or the robots. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3691.4s)]
*  When I can communicate with other people. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3693.24s)]
*  Give me that. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3694.44s)]
*  There's that too. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3694.92s)]
*  This is another tweet you'll put out. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3697.56s)]
*  He says, the first neural link product is called telepathy. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3699.0s)]
*  He does do, they have great marketing. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3703.88s)]
*  Telepathy is what a great name. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3706.76s)]
*  He says, enables control of your phone or computer and through them almost any device. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3707.88s)]
*  Just by thinking initial users will be those that have lost the use of their limbs. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3712.12s)]
*  Imagine if Stephen Hawking could communicate faster than a speed typist or auctioneer. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3717.16s)]
*  That is his goal. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3722.44s)]
*  And I knew Stephen Hawking well. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3723.48s)]
*  I flew him into Zero G back in 2007. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3726.2s)]
*  And I remember just the painstaking rate of communication. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3730.6s)]
*  He's tapping. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3735.0s)]
*  He's using his eyes on a screen to be able to select a single letter at a time. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3736.7599999999998s)]
*  And today using AI, you can get to 60 words per minute, which is pretty amazing. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3743.3199999999997s)]
*  And this will be even further. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3749.88s)]
*  So listen, I'm super pumped about this. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3753.0s)]
*  Let me ask you a question. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3756.2799999999997s)]
*  Let's say it's available. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3758.04s)]
*  Are you in as soon as possible? [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3760.2s)]
*  For something like this? [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3762.92s)]
*  Yes. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3764.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3764.68s)]
*  I'd prefer it not be invasive. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3766.2799999999997s)]
*  But let's say it is. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3768.52s)]
*  It requires surgery. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3770.12s)]
*  It's going to be, by the way, neural links, I've seen the tech. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3772.04s)]
*  It is a fully robotic surgeon that anesthetizes you, cuts it open, [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3776.2799999999997s)]
*  drill a small hole, places it in, places the thousand filaments on your neocortex, [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3781.64s)]
*  seals it up with glue. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3787.8799999999997s)]
*  I'd be in. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3790.04s)]
*  I think that's way more interesting than getting a chip planted in between your knuckles. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3791.48s)]
*  But that's true functionality that augments human capacity. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3800.12s)]
*  And then the application, it's software, right? [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3805.7999999999997s)]
*  And whatever you can program it to do, you can do. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3809.3199999999997s)]
*  That software upgrade, it's like wake up smarter every morning. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3811.56s)]
*  You know, bringing it full circle as we wrap here to robots, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3814.6000000000004s)]
*  the thing that is going to happen and is going to be incredibly cool is when I have my neural link in [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3820.0400000000004s)]
*  and I can occupy my optimus. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3827.5600000000004s)]
*  Well, not just the optimus, but five of them around the house, right? [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3829.7200000000003s)]
*  You clean up the kitchen. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3833.1600000000003s)]
*  And by the way, I can see through one optical nerve what you're doing. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3834.44s)]
*  So do it this way. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3838.0400000000004s)]
*  And over here, oh, by the way, put the jam in this drawer, not over there. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3839.4s)]
*  It's the kitchen of the fridge and do that in parallel. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3844.52s)]
*  And now you can do things at scale and each human being gets augmented like a thousand times. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3848.12s)]
*  Have you ever read Ramez Nam's books, Nexus? [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3854.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3857.64s)]
*  Huge. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3857.88s)]
*  So I'm just rereading them again. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3858.52s)]
*  By the way, listening to this, if you've not read Ramez Nam and AAM, he's- [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3860.12s)]
*  Trilogy called Nexus. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3866.92s)]
*  Yes. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3868.12s)]
*  It's Nexus, Apex, and Crux. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3868.52s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3871.08s)]
*  It's about a product, a sort of neural lace called Nexus that allows you to have telepathy, [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3871.7999999999997s)]
*  it allows you to connect to the cloud and he explores everything here. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3880.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3885.3199999999997s)]
*  Beautifully written. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3885.64s)]
*  It's incredible. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3886.68s)]
*  I'm jealous for people who are reading it for the first time. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3888.3599999999997s)]
*  It's that good. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3890.4399999999996s)]
*  It's really good. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7kzoFSRgY&t=3891.24s)]
