# Anthony Scaramucci: Elon, DOGE & America’s Fate Under New Leadership (w/ Salim Ismail) | EP #132
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [November 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw)
*  Hi everybody, Peter Diamandis here. Welcome to Moonshots. In this episode, we'll be diving into [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=0.0s)]
*  the Department of Government Efficiencies, Elon, Bitcoin, and the broader effects of the new [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4.48s)]
*  administration on technology. I'm joined by previous White House Director of Communications [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=10.24s)]
*  and Financier Anthony Scaramucci and Salim Ismail in our normal WTF Just Happened in Tech this week. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=15.76s)]
*  Views expressed in this conversation belong to individuals expressing them. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=24.16s)]
*  My hope is that you are open to this conversation and the many ideas put forward for the future of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=29.04s)]
*  America. You know me, I'm not political. I am pro-technology and I am pro-creating an extraordinary [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=34.56s)]
*  world ahead. For the record, I'm excited about the coming four years and I believe it could be [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=42.0s)]
*  a true roaring 20s. Like all things, time will tell. Okay, enjoy this episode. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=47.36s)]
*  All right, first question. Everybody wants to know this. Mouch, is Elon gonna make it in the White [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=54.4s)]
*  House? I mean, I know you're friends with Elon, so you want me to be as honest as I usually am? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=59.6s)]
*  Yeah, tell me how many days do you think Elon's gonna exist in this White House? So, you know, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=64.16s)]
*  for politics, I measure things in 11 day units of time also called Scaramucci. Okay, so, and you [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=70.8s)]
*  could use it in a sentence like, Liz Truss lasted 4.1 Scaramucci's, right? Or Kevin McCarthy lasted [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=77.44s)]
*  24.5. Okay, so I think Elon Musk is gonna last, in my opinion, 30 Scaramucci's. That's 330 days [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=84.16s)]
*  from the inauguration. That's pretty good. That's that plan X. Yeah, because he is [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  the richest person that Trump knows personally. Okay, now maybe Putin and MBS are richer, but [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=101.84s)]
*  they're governmental riches. This is commercial riches. And Trump will bite, I know this sounds [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=106.72s)]
*  crazy to people, but Trump will bite his tongue at times. But he heard Elon already. And, you know, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=114.32s)]
*  now he heard Elon, Peter, right? Well, he's already started heading towards coal and regular gas cars [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=122.0s)]
*  because they're cheaper and more reliable. What else? How else has he done that? Yeah, so you're [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=130.32s)]
*  saying you heard him economically. I'm talking about politically, he teemed them with Vivek. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=135.68s)]
*  Okay, and so Elon is not an equal to Vivek. I like Vivek, I respect Vivek, but they're not equals. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=140.4s)]
*  Okay, that was a Trump move to stuff Elon a little bit. By the way, can I ask, is all of this on the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=146.4s)]
*  record? Yeah, of course. I have the Trump decoder ring. You know, I, you don't even, Diamandis, you [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=154.0s)]
*  don't even have to buy the cereal, okay? You don't have to dig into the cereal like when you were [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=161.20000000000002s)]
*  a kid to get the Trump decoder ring. I have it. And I'll give it to you. What's it say? Okay, so [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=165.2s)]
*  you want to hear how it's going to go? Yeah, I want to hear the details. Now, this is moonshots, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=171.11999999999998s)]
*  and, you know, listen, Elon in the White House is a moonshot, actually it's a Mars shot, but I want [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=177.04s)]
*  to hear how it's going to go. Well, first of all, you guys start at the origin. You have to start [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=184.16s)]
*  at the origin, okay? I don't know Elon, you know Elon. Okay, I obviously respect Elon, I think he's [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=189.12s)]
*  a very incredible figure and a brilliant entrepreneur, but you have to start at the origin, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=193.92s)]
*  and it always starts this way. You get punished by Trump. Elon came to visit me, he was on his knees. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=199.67999999999998s)]
*  Okay, you remember those tweets or you don't remember those tweets? I don't. So you get punished [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=206.79999999999998s)]
*  by Trump. What's that? I don't remember. But I can imagine them. I mean, you know, it's all within the- [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=210.32s)]
*  He was eviscerating, he was eviscerating Elon in 2018 and 2019. And so, because Elon was a Democrat, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=216.48s)]
*  okay? And so, the game changed when Elon went to him and said, I have to leave the Democratic Party, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=225.52s)]
*  because they wouldn't invite me to his EV summit, which was a big mistake. You know, the UAW [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=232.8s)]
*  went to Biden and said, you can't invite Elon to the EV summit. So Biden said, okay, no problem. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=237.6s)]
*  Meantime, Elon has got more EVs going than anybody else. It was a colossal mistake. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=242.8s)]
*  Why upset Elon? But you have to understand it started in antagonism. And this is how Trump's [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=248.8s)]
*  relationships go. If you're in Trump's world, there's one spotlight. It's on Donald Trump. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=254.4s)]
*  He's inverse Reagan. Okay, so what was Reagan? Reagan had a plaque on his desk that said, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=260.16s)]
*  you can get anywhere you want in life, as long as you don't care who gets the credit. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=264.96000000000004s)]
*  Trump is inverse Reagan. I get all the credit, you get none of the credit. Don't get too famous, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  don't get too big for your britches, or I'm going to hit you with a ray gun. And that's what he does. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=275.44000000000005s)]
*  So you guys are pretty smart guys, right? I'm not as smart as the two of you, but we all know that [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=280.32000000000005s)]
*  the definition of insanity is to do the same thing over and over again and predict a different [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=285.68s)]
*  outcome. So let me submit to you rhetorically, you both answer the question. If there were 40 [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=291.04s)]
*  of us that went to work for Donald Trump, and 40 of us got eviscerated in different ways, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=296.0s)]
*  and blown out, and interacted with the mania that Donald Trump represents, and then we spoke out [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=302.32s)]
*  against him and said the guy's nuts, including his former vice president. Are you telling me now the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=308.88s)]
*  new group of people around him are going to have a totally different experience than the last group [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=314.96s)]
*  of people? I mean people can change. I mean people can change, maybe just not that much. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=320.48s)]
*  Listen, I think the data- So I thought this was like, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=328.88s)]
*  Selim, this is an unfiltered, he's got a lot of economic interests here, right? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=332.72s)]
*  Hey, so a question for you. The guy's 78 years old. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=338.16s)]
*  Yeah, I'm kidding. So the probability is you're playing with fire. Listen, I am so excited about [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=342.0s)]
*  the next four years from a technology standpoint, which is, by the way, the topic of this conversation. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=349.92s)]
*  This is our WTF just happened in tech this week. So from a technology standpoint, it is. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=357.52000000000004s)]
*  So I'm with you. I'm with you on that. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=362.64000000000004s)]
*  So can I ask you a question? If you were going into this administration, not saying that you are, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=364.8s)]
*  but if you were going to go, what title would you like in this administration? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=368.8s)]
*  I want sort of like a secretary of abundance would be mine. Selim, how about you? What do you want? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=372.88s)]
*  I would go after the doge thing just because I think there's an unbelievable opportunity to [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=381.91999999999996s)]
*  shift things, just not in the style that's going on right now. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=386.47999999999996s)]
*  Problem with the doge thing, if you don't know what I'm saying, is [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=389.67999999999995s)]
*  austerity is a bummer and a buzzkill for everybody. And so yes, is there on the margin [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=391.91999999999996s)]
*  things that can be cut and on the margin of the things that can be made more efficient? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=398.64s)]
*  I'm certain that that's true, but I don't see two trillion dollars in that budget cutting. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=402.96s)]
*  I don't see it and it'll cause a colossal collapse in the U.S. economy. So I don't see that. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=408.64s)]
*  I mean, we could manage our way out of the debt crisis, but that would be a 15-year management of [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=414.4s)]
*  it. But when he said, Peter's the secretary of abundance, I see that. But like the best job, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=419.44s)]
*  the best job would be secretary of the Constitution. That'd be the best job. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=426.96000000000004s)]
*  Is that what you wanted? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=432.40000000000003s)]
*  Because you have to understand something. Your prosperity, your life as Peter Diamandis [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=433.36s)]
*  has been created by that Constitution. You're from a family of Greek immigrants. You came to [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=439.92s)]
*  the country, I'm going to guess, not as wealthy as you are now. That's probably true for most people. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=445.68s)]
*  And you're Italian immigrants? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=451.52s)]
*  I came from Italian immigrants and this country's flat, decentralized system that's lasted 250 [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=453.44s)]
*  years, you and me, Salim, we are direct beneficiaries of that. So if you said to me, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=462.96000000000004s)]
*  I was going into the administration, which of course I would never be asked to go into [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=468.48s)]
*  this administration, I would want to be secretary of the Constitution. Because in order to get the [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=472.08000000000004s)]
*  abundance right, we have to reframe the Constitution, probably add at least two [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=478.56s)]
*  amendments to that Constitution. And I'll submit to you guys, because you're technologists, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=483.84s)]
*  we are dealing with an old operating system. That Constitution has 27 amendments. That [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=489.52s)]
*  Constitution should be amended every eight years by virtue of that. We have not had a significant [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=496.72s)]
*  amendment to that Constitution to the 1965 civil rights voting rights amendment. And so we've gone [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=502.56s)]
*  59 years without a significant amendment to the Constitution. And that's very, very dangerous. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=510.24s)]
*  That's not what the founders wanted. And we need to reframe, reset the boundaries of what our [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=517.2s)]
*  checks and balances are. And we got to remake the system. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=524.0s)]
*  Salim, I'm going to jump you in here because you came from the two extremes, right? Your family [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=528.56s)]
*  comes from India, which is all about hierarchy. And it's about where you were born and what your [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=534.16s)]
*  origin story is. The caste system is crazy. And you then go to become a successful US entrepreneur. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=541.28s)]
*  So you've got far more the extreme of any of us. How do you think about that? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=547.04s)]
*  So I agree with, I totally agree on the Constitution side, if you could change it. For me, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=552.72s)]
*  the Constitution is the software that runs the country and you have to be able to update it. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=559.5200000000001s)]
*  The problem is in this political environment, you can't update it very easily. And you've got this [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=563.6s)]
*  whole segment of originalists that are like, oh, let's go back to what the framers were thinking [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=568.32s)]
*  and try and guess what they were thinking. The problem is you can't and they built it in so that [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=574.24s)]
*  you would update the Constitution. I totally agree that that's where a whole bunch of things [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=578.08s)]
*  need to start. But how do you update it in this environment? So I think that's a valid starting [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=583.0400000000001s)]
*  point. It was built, this Constitution and this nation was built, you know, 200, 300 years ago [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=588.72s)]
*  under a very different situation where people were not educated. You couldn't communicate other than, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=594.5600000000001s)]
*  you know, days worth of horse piggyback horsing across the country. We have representative [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=600.1600000000001s)]
*  constitu- representative government and not a actual democracy. So I'd like to be able to vote [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=606.24s)]
*  on issues or assign my votes to to Scaramucci here on things dealing with the Constitution, to [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=613.28s)]
*  Salim on things dealing with hair growth and basically change the change the picture there. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=621.04s)]
*  Low blow, low blow. I'm sorry, I couldn't, I couldn't. Yeah, I think this is the biggest, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=628.32s)]
*  could resist. I think this is the biggest structural issue. But I have a question, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=633.92s)]
*  Anthony. When you look at the debt issue, how do you see, forget the politics of it, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=637.52s)]
*  is there any viable path to solving the debt problem? Yeah, this is definitely a viable path [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=643.52s)]
*  and you guys are close to Elon. I'm not. And if I, if I tweeted this, it's coming from me, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=648.7199999999999s)]
*  so it would be perceived as negative from the Trump administration. But let me give you some [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=655.04s)]
*  things to think about in the Alan Greenspan book, The Age of Turbulence, which was written in 2007, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=658.64s)]
*  okay, there was a exposition of what the pay as you go legislation was. And so let me, let me, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=666.56s)]
*  let me discuss that with you. Do you know what that is pay as you go legislation? I do not. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=673.36s)]
*  If you don't know, I'll give a brief explanation. So, so Richard Dorman, Office of Management and [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=677.4399999999999s)]
*  Budget, he's working for George Herbert Walker Bush. He goes to Bush and says, listen, we had [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=684.08s)]
*  tremendous deficit spending on the Reagan. We're, we're, we're, we're going to have a peace dividend. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=689.6s)]
*  The walls come down. We're going to have this peach dividend, but we've got to create some [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=694.88s)]
*  guard werealls on the Congress. And so I'm going to propose legislation, we got to get Democrats [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=699.84s)]
*  and Republicans to vote on it. Here's the legislation pay as you go. If you want a tax cut, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=704.88s)]
*  that's fine. But then you have to find something in the government to cut. If you want a increase [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=711.2s)]
*  in social services, that's fine. But then you have to raise taxes somewhere. And so Richard [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=716.5600000000001s)]
*  Gephardt worked on this with them. Some Democrats actually lost their seats. They passed this [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=722.4s)]
*  legislation. And then we went to war accidentally, the Gulf War, we had a recession in the United [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=727.2s)]
*  States and they wanted to increase social services. And so all of us remember Bush raised taxes, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=733.2s)]
*  pursuant to pay as you go, read my lips, no new taxes, but he violated that. Right. And he raised [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=739.84s)]
*  taxes. Okay. When, when Clinton won the presidency, Bush said to him, listen, we put this pay as you [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=745.84s)]
*  go legislation in. If you adhere to it, you'll run a budget surplus by the end of the decade. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=752.8000000000001s)]
*  And, and Clinton said, okay, Robert Wright, my old law school professor, wanted to run deficits. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=759.5200000000001s)]
*  He was the secretary of labor. Robert Rubin, my old boss from Goldman, he said, no, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=765.2s)]
*  go for the tax increase, stick to pay as you go. You'll send a big message to the bond markets [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=771.28s)]
*  and we'll get to, we'll get to a surplus in this country. So Clinton listened to Rubin. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=776.88s)]
*  At the end of his term, we printed a $240 billion surplus. And just to remind everybody, the CBO, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=783.44s)]
*  nonpartisan congressional budget office estimated that there would be a $5 trillion budget surplus [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=791.28s)]
*  by the end of calendar year, 2010. Okay. That did not happen. And the campaign Bush versus Gore, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=798.64s)]
*  Gore said, I want to push that money into the environment. Bush said, I want to give it back [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=805.8399999999999s)]
*  to the taxpayers. Bush won the race. He cut taxes in March, but then guys, we went to war in October [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=810.7199999999999s)]
*  of 2001. It's the first time in us history that we went to war without a tax increase. In fact, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=818.56s)]
*  we had a tax cut before the war and it started this deficit trajectory that we're on now. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=824.8s)]
*  So if you want to curb that, you have to restore Pago. You've got to get somebody like Elon Musk [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=831.5999999999999s)]
*  behind it. Yes, he can shave a point here or a point there off of the growth of these governmental [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=838.4s)]
*  agencies. But if you actually put the guard rails in over time, what will happen is you'll get to [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=844.16s)]
*  a surplus again. Now, could it take 15 years? Salim? Yes, it could, but you would stop the [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=851.6s)]
*  exponential bleeding that we're in right now. So I submit to you guys, you can't cut two trillion [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=858.16s)]
*  from the budget. It would be too austere. It would cause an economic collapse, but you could put the [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=864.3199999999999s)]
*  country on a controlled diet. What is the total budget today that you're cutting two trillion? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=870.32s)]
*  Six point seven trillion. Okay. So listen, we're taking in about five trillion in tax revenues. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=874.72s)]
*  We're running about a one point six, one point seven trillion dollar deficit. One question, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=882.08s)]
*  which is, do you guys agree that there is most likely two trillion of fat and unrequired expense [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=887.2800000000001s)]
*  in the government budget? I do not agree with that. I don't think you have that. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=895.84s)]
*  You don't think we can have a budget. I agree. You don't have to really cut entitlements or cut [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=901.52s)]
*  military. Could you cut six, seven percent from the budget? Yes. Could you find three to five [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=905.6s)]
*  hundred billion dollars of stuff to cut from the budget? Yes, I do believe that. Could you cut [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=912.48s)]
*  two trillion dollars from the budget without causing a colossal contraction in the economy? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=918.3199999999999s)]
*  No. Did you see the movie Oppenheimer? If you did, did you know that besides building the atomic [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=926.0s)]
*  bomb at Los Alamos National Labs, that they spent billions on bio-defense weapons, the ability to [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=932.48s)]
*  accurately detect viruses and microbes by reading their RNA? Well, a company called Viome exclusively [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=939.6s)]
*  licensed the technology from Los Alamos Labs to build a platform that can measure your microbiome [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=946.32s)]
*  and the RNA in your blood. Now, Viome has a product that I've personally used for years called [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=953.36s)]

*  about AI, humanoid robotics, Bitcoin, a whole slew of other technologies, we have the ability [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1034.6399999999999s)]
*  to accelerate the US economy significantly. I mean, for me, I think that we're about to enter [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1040.6399999999999s)]
*  a period of the roaring 20s, that if we can really hit on deregulation across a number of industries, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1047.76s)]
*  if we can increase our energy budget across the United States, if we can give people who get their [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1056.48s)]
*  PhDs at our top universities a green card so they stay here, increase intellectual [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1063.28s)]

*  revenues up and to the right, in addition to cuts. I mean, I think this is the most exciting time [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1076.1599999999999s)]
*  ever to be an entrepreneur and a technologist. I'm curious, do you agree with that thesis? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1082.24s)]
*  Yes, but I think there's so many structural issues happening like potential war. I think [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1089.28s)]
*  there has to be a structured path, a glide path to balancing the budget because otherwise if we [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1096.4s)]
*  keep running up debt, and this is the problem that neither party dealt with in the election, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1103.1200000000001s)]
*  is the unbelievable debt cycle because that's an exponential curve in the wrong way. It doesn't [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1108.64s)]
*  matter much else what we do, is you'll hobble the government and the country so much by doing that, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1115.0400000000002s)]
*  and the whole thing will implode. That's, I think, the danger that Anthony's pointing out. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1121.68s)]
*  It's never worked, though. I mean, so the idea has never worked that 14 years of austerity in [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1125.92s)]
*  Great Britain has left the country weaker and combined with Brexit. Ronald Reagan understood [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1130.48s)]
*  that. FDR understood that. Austerity does not work, and that type of radicalism at the governmental [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1136.16s)]
*  level. Remember, everybody says the government should be run like a business. I can prove to you [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1143.3600000000001s)]
*  empirically, I can prove to you through history that the government should not be run like a [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1147.76s)]
*  business. And it's not a business. The government has to be run with a public service orientation [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1153.76s)]
*  towards policy, and whether people like this or not, the bottom rungs of the people in a society [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1160.24s)]
*  have to be protected by a government. And I would submit to you that Henry Ford got this right. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1166.64s)]
*  Henry Ford was a great social engineer. He told people, you are going to make enough money to [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1171.0400000000002s)]
*  afford the car that you're producing. Moreover, I'm going to make sure you're in a small house with [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1177.8400000000001s)]
*  a great school system because I don't want you descending on my Dearborn, Michigan mansion [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1182.3200000000002s)]
*  with a tiki torch and a pitchfork. I just don't want that. Okay? And so he understood that good [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1187.28s)]
*  social engineering from the government is aspirational. My dad is a crane operator out [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1194.08s)]
*  here on Long Island with a good union wage, could afford a $16,000 house in 1962, and we could live [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1199.28s)]
*  as a small little hallway kitchen, one regular bath, but five of us lived there very comfortably, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1208.6399999999999s)]
*  went to a good public school system, and we rose in America. We had an aspirational blue collar [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1213.84s)]
*  family. Governments have to protect that. You know, Trump got the salt deduction wrong, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1219.84s)]
*  and to his credit, it wasn't his fault. It was policy that was put on him by the Koch family [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1225.52s)]
*  and by Paul Ryan. But what he got wrong, he now understands. Okay? In December of 2017, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1231.1999999999998s)]
*  when I was still talking with Trump, he said, what do you think of the salt tax deduction? [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1238.72s)]
*  And again, that's a limitation of $10,000 of state income taxes off your federal return. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1243.9199999999998s)]
*  And what I said to the president at that time, it's going to hurt the economy. It's going to hurt [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1250.0s)]
*  the engines in the economy. He said, well, why is that? I said, well, these coastal cities, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1254.0s)]
*  Santa Monica, New York, Philadelphia, these coastal cities need safety nets. They're blue for a reason. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1258.9599999999998s)]
*  Poor people are teeming into the place. Did Sergey Brin, was he super wealthy when he arrived in the [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1266.56s)]
*  United States? Was Elon Musk a multi-gagillionaire when he arrived in the United States? No. And so [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1273.12s)]
*  what you need from your government is you need a platform of equal opportunity. We don't want [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1279.2s)]
*  equal outcomes. The three of us, I think, agree on that. We are libertarians. I want there to be [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1285.76s)]
*  Jeff Bezos's, Peter Diamandis's, Elon Musk's. But what we have to make sure, though, the government's [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1290.88s)]
*  got to supply a smart kid growing up in a poor neighborhood or growing up with a dysfunctional [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1296.64s)]

*  reasons, you can't run the government like a business and you can't take a hacksaw to the [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1308.72s)]
*  government. If you do that, you'll paralyze the system and it'll be very bad for the culture. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1315.12s)]
*  So how do you really feel about that? You invited me out for Peter. You invited me out for a reason. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1319.28s)]
*  I did. I did. Absolutely. I love it. Listen, so Trump taps Musk to lead the Doge and then [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1325.28s)]
*  adds a buddy. It's very funny. One of the tweets that came out is, oh my God, the Department of [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1335.6s)]
*  Government Efficiency is getting off to a bad start because it's being run by two people instead of [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1341.68s)]
*  one. How do you think that's going to go? It's not going to go well. There's a number of different [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1346.8s)]
*  reasons. Number one, you have to understand something about Washington. Washington has an [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1351.6s)]
*  immunological system. Yeah, I agree with that. What's the immunological system? An antigen comes [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1354.9599999999998s)]
*  into Washington and they recognize it and then they blow the antigen out. They discredit the person. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1360.8799999999999s)]
*  They drop opposition research on them or they grind them. There's four ways to get grinded in [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1367.12s)]
*  Washington. You want to hear the four ways? I do. Yeah. Okay. Way number one is you get an [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1372.8s)]
*  oppo drop. You get an oppo drop. Peter Diamandis, here's the USB, here's all the bad things about [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1378.8s)]
*  Peter's life. Go write that. I owe you a favor. You owe me a favor. Let's get it on the front page of [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1384.48s)]
*  the Washington Post. That's number one. Number two, you grind Peter with a security clearance. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1390.0s)]
*  So you say, okay, I really hate Peter's guts. Let me call my buddies that are going to give [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1397.28s)]
*  him a security clearance and tell them that you can't get the security clearance. They did that [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1400.96s)]
*  to Jared Kushner, grinding, grinding, grinding. Number three, Peter has an asset on his balance [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1404.8s)]
*  sheet that he has to dislodge to get into the government. Sometimes there's exceptions. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1412.08s)]
*  Let me find the most painful asset on Peter's balance sheet. Maybe it's his favorite thoroughbred [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1418.72s)]
*  horse. Maybe it's his favorite hockey team. And we say, well, Peter, you got to sell that hockey [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1423.84s)]
*  team. Otherwise, you can't be the secretary of abundance. So they have processes to grind you. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1428.88s)]
*  The fourth way is the front step. They come right at your face and they say, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1436.16s)]
*  Peter, we hate your guts here in Washington. We don't want you anywhere near Washington. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1442.0800000000002s)]
*  Now, the fourth way never happens. That's never happens. That's a Wall Street thing. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1446.4s)]
*  So there's three ways, not four. I just wanted to point out that the fourth way never happens. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1451.8400000000001s)]
*  So they're going to grind you on. They're going to grind Vivek. And remember, the Department of [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1456.72s)]
*  Governmental Efficiency is not a department. It's never been created. You would need a vote in the [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1462.16s)]
*  Congress to create that department. You'd have to supply budget. Is it going to be a cabinet level [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1467.2s)]
*  department? And if it is, then there's a whole rigmarole that has to go through in the Congress [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1473.28s)]
*  just to ask the people that formed the Department of Homeland Security. So this is not something [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1477.92s)]
*  that can happen easily. And him teaming Elon with Vivek was a way for sending both of those guys out [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1484.4s)]
*  to pasture. All right. Now, they'll both probably be mad at me if they listen to your podcast. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1490.72s)]
*  And they'd be like, fuck mooch. What is he talking about? But I know, fellas, I have the Trump decoder [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1496.72s)]
*  ring. I know how the guy operates. If you give me a call, I can tell you what he's going to do, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1502.4s)]
*  how he's going to do it, because it's fairly predictable. It's a fairly predictable Trump [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1507.8400000000001s)]
*  algorithm. Do you think there's some softening between the first term and some of the rhetoric [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1512.64s)]
*  in the second term, where now he can set a legacy? OK, so that's the hope, right? So [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1517.6000000000001s)]
*  let me say it this way. The stock market believes that Donald Trump is going to run the country as a [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1523.8400000000001s)]
*  moderate, centrist, center-right Republican. The stock market believes what Peter is saying. You're [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1532.24s)]
*  going to get mild to massive deregulation, beneficial to biotech, beneficial to banking, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1538.32s)]
*  beneficial to crypto. You're going to get policies that will foment peace in the Middle East and the [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1546.0s)]
*  Ukraine. You'll figure out a way to dial down the tension globally. And the market is telling you [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1553.04s)]
*  that the cultural stance that Donald Trump has taken, and don't underestimate the cancel culture [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1560.48s)]
*  in our society, the negative impact it has had on people as evidence. My friend Scott Galloway [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1567.2s)]
*  would tell you that men, white men, 18 to 36 have a 33% higher incidence of suicide than any other [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1572.72s)]
*  group of people. OK, and this cancel culture has really hurt the society. And this is one of the [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1580.96s)]
*  reasons why women were voting for their husbands, and they were voting for their sons, and they were [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1586.24s)]
*  voting for their brothers in the 2024 election. 46% of the women voted Donald Trump. Over 50% of [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1591.68s)]
*  the white women voted Donald Trump. When asked why are they doing that, we're done. We're tired of [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1600.0800000000002s)]
*  the cancel culture and the pronoun usage and the different bathrooms and the sports being screwed [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1605.3600000000001s)]
*  up by this nonsense that we're doing in the country. So for me, there is a shot here. Trump's 78 [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1612.24s)]
*  years old. He's got four years to run. If he's going to respect the democracy, some people think [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1618.4s)]
*  he's not going to. His rhetoric suggests that he may not. But he's going to respect the democracy. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1624.0s)]
*  Why not run the government, I should say, as a transformative, post-partisan figure? [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1628.88s)]
*  He has this unbelievable opportunity. 78 to 82 transformed the country. You know, the guy got [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1637.2s)]
*  shot at, I think on the 13th of July, okay, where it nicked his ear or something like that. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1644.72s)]
*  I don't know exactly what happened, but he was bleeding. He was shot at, and it was a near miss, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1651.6000000000001s)]
*  a near death experience. God forbid, no one would want that. We don't, we abhor political violence. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1657.44s)]
*  But one would hope that that type of near death experience would hopefully transform him. Maybe [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1663.44s)]
*  he'll sit there and say, I've got four years. I'm going to bring Peter in to learn about [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1670.08s)]
*  abundance. I'm going to bring Salim in to learn about entrepreneurship. And I'm going to push an [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1675.1999999999998s)]
*  agenda that's healing and unifying to the country. That could happen. But there's another scenario [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1680.56s)]
*  that happens that could be ugly for the country, and it would be sad if it happens. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1687.52s)]
*  What do you think is the worst case scenario? [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1691.36s)]
*  Oh, I mean, unfortunately, the worst case scenario is he takes the Project 2025 [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1693.4399999999998s)]
*  playbook and he begins a process of deportation. So the deportation would be cataclysmic. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1698.72s)]
*  I would hope somebody like Elon Musk, who's a very smart man, would get in his ear and beg him not [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1705.84s)]
*  to do that because the deportation comes with SWAT vehicles, armored vehicles, concentration camps. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1710.8s)]
*  It would be one of the bloodiest cultural exercises, and it would ruin the welcome mat [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1718.56s)]
*  that this society presents. Lee Kuan Yew told Graham Allison, the dean of the Kennedy School [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1725.52s)]
*  of Government, the founder of Singapore, said that America will always be preeminent. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1730.32s)]
*  Why do you feel that way? Because of the welcome mat. You can come to America from any part of the [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1736.8799999999999s)]
*  world, rich or poor. You can arrive in America and in five short years, you become an American. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1743.44s)]
*  Maybe it's an Indian American. Maybe it's a Greek American. Maybe it's an Italian American. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1749.92s)]
*  But you become an American. It's very, very hard to do that in other cultures, a result of which [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1753.84s)]
*  the balance sheet of intellectual capital that can arrive in America is unlimited. If you graphically [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1760.8799999999999s)]
*  deport 15 million people from America, and again, don't go by me. That's what he's saying. That's [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1769.04s)]
*  what Tom Homan is saying. Okay, if you do that, you will destroy the fabric of what this thing [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1775.76s)]
*  represents to the rest of the world. So I agree with you, but there are two sides to that equation. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1782.24s)]
*  Right now, we, you know... Be careful. You don't want to agree with me because I'm, you know, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1788.4s)]
*  I'm on the Trump enemy list. No, no. I think, Peter... About three days ago, Trump said I was [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1792.64s)]
*  the major loser on truth social. So how much do you think Trump loves me on a scale of one to ten? [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1797.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. I got that at a 9.5, right? Don't you think? I agree with you. Why is he still talking about me? [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1803.2s)]
*  I agree with you on the mass deportation. I do believe there is a percentage of those individuals [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1807.28s)]
*  who are criminals, who should not be in this country, who we should be looking at removing [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1813.12s)]
*  them out of society. I also think, unfortunately, that we send so many people back with a PhD [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1818.96s)]
*  that they earned at MIT or Harvard or Stanford, and then they're exited from the country. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1824.96s)]
*  Right? It's perverse and in reverse. And so, you know, how do we stamp a green card, a staple green [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1829.44s)]
*  card on those diplomas? These individuals who come to the U.S. to get the best education, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1836.48s)]
*  they, you know, there should be, in fact, not only a welcoming, but like, you know, a requirement for [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1841.68s)]
*  them to stay in country and build their companies. You know, we have our native Indian Indian here, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1848.08s)]
*  Saleem. Now we have, you know, the CEOs of the top tech companies in the U.S. have come from India. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1856.16s)]
*  It's an incredible engine where we can attract those who have the aspiration and the drive and [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1863.76s)]
*  the willpower to the United States. We should keep those people here for sure. So listen, we agree, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1870.16s)]
*  but you have to understand something. When the leader of the free world and the leader of a [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1876.16s)]
*  country that Lincoln called the last best hope for mankind is using the rhetoric of dehumanization [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1882.16s)]
*  on non-white immigrants of the country. Okay. When he's dehumanizing those people and he's [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1889.44s)]
*  talking about those people as us versus them and vermin and they're eating dogs and cats, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1894.64s)]
*  okay, is very, very bad symbolism for the United States. It just is. It's not, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1900.64s)]
*  that's not the symbolism, okay, that we should be projecting in the United States. Okay. You can get [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1904.8000000000002s)]
*  Trump policies that you may like without that type of brutal rhetoric that creates Nazis walking [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1912.0s)]
*  around in Columbus, Ohio this weekend, SWAT stickers getting sprayed on synagogues. We don't [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1920.08s)]
*  need that, Peter. We do not need that. I will continually speak out against that. It's totally [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1926.4s)]
*  unnecessary. Yes, it's a rough sport politics. I get it, but we don't have to go into the realm [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1933.2s)]
*  of hate speech. We just don't have to do that. I want to go into the realm of Bitcoin. So, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1939.92s)]
*  you've got a book coming out on December 4th, the little book of Bitcoin. You just released [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1945.44s)]
*  a revision of the little book of Hedge Fund. We're going to put a link in the notes here for your [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1951.92s)]
*  pre-orders for little book of Bitcoin. And today, OMG, we're at- Thank you for your help on it, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1957.3600000000001s)]
*  by the way. You're welcome, buddy. Pleasure to have contributed in a small way. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1963.76s)]
*  Okay. Today, we're at $94,000 for Bitcoin. And Salim, the bet you took by mortgaging your house [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1967.84s)]
*  and spending it on buying Bitcoin, good move, buddy. Good move. So, $94,000. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1977.28s)]
*  My wife wouldn't let me do all of it, but yeah. Well, okay. Time to mortgage again [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1984.0s)]
*  and put more in. So, here's a question, right? So, Cathie Wood is predicting by 2030, we'll see $1.5 [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1989.04s)]
*  million to $2 million per Bitcoin. I've seen higher and lower estimates. You know, I remember [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=1995.92s)]
*  this great cartoon that had a father and a son talking and it said, Dad, do you remember when [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2002.48s)]
*  Bitcoin was under $100,000? You know, and we're seeing that. We're seeing this massive increase. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2009.28s)]
*  So, Mooch, what's your prediction? What are you feeling? What are you seeing? And let's talk about [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2016.24s)]
*  underlying forces here. Well, the first thing I want to say is that I didn't see it. I got it [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2021.92s)]
*  wrong. I went to this wonderful event at Singularity University and I heard Salim speak and I heard you [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2027.76s)]
*  speak and you may or may not remember this, but I think you wrote, actually, you contributed this [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2035.92s)]
*  to my book, so you do remember it. I met Hal Finney and he was describing to us what Bitcoin was [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2040.24s)]
*  and I don't know, was it $100, Salim? $200? I don't remember exactly what it was. It was about $300 [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2047.3600000000001s)]
*  but I didn't understand it. Okay, about $300. So, I didn't understand it and so, as Salim said, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2052.4s)]
*  Michael Saylor says, you get Bitcoin at the price you deserve. It took me a long time and I finally [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2059.5200000000004s)]
*  got it. I started buying it in October 2020, November, December. Still a great time. The average [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2066.96s)]
*  price for the block, yeah, the average price for the block I bought was $17,000. I've held every [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2073.28s)]
*  coin. I bought more coins in the weakness into 2022 but the reason I'm starting with, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2079.76s)]
*  I didn't understand it, is there might be viewers and listeners to your show that are our age, Peter, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2085.6800000000003s)]
*  that may not understand it or they may be afraid of it. Okay, so I appreciate you bringing up my [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2091.92s)]
*  book because I tried to write a book the way Salim wrote that entrepreneur's book, you know, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2095.84s)]
*  10 or so years ago, about what it actually is. So, you could open the book. It's not going to [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2101.04s)]
*  intimidate you. You could read what it actually is and then maybe at the end of the book, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2106.88s)]
*  I would make the case this is the best investment of my lifetime and I would make the case that this [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2112.0s)]
*  is probably still got a 10X in it, I would think. It can get to the market capitalization of gold [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2117.36s)]
*  and what I would say to people is I don't know anyone that's done the homework, Peter, Salim, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2125.52s)]
*  anyone that's done the homework that hasn't gone towards Bitcoin. I've never met somebody who said, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2132.24s)]
*  you know, Peter, I did a tremendous amount of homework on this, hours and hours and hours, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2137.6s)]
*  and I wouldn't touch this with a 10-foot pole. Paul Tudor Jones, Stan Druckenmiller, Howard [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2142.16s)]
*  Lutnick, I could name allegiance of people, Michael Saylor. Michael Saylor told me, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2147.6s)]
*  and he'll tell you this, Bitcoin is a joke. That's what he said. Okay, it was like 2016, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2154.16s)]
*  2017. Early on, yes. He started, yeah, early on. He started buying Bitcoin in August of 2020. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2159.92s)]
*  His first Bitcoin he bought, 2020. And then, you know, he got into a conversation with my partner [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2167.6s)]
*  and he says, you guys have to buy some of this Bitcoin. You know what he said? Once I figured it [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2173.84s)]
*  out, I couldn't sleep. I couldn't sleep once I figured it out. I think his framing of do 100 [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2178.88s)]
*  hours research on it and then see. And it's really an arbitrage on intellect and studiousness is what [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2186.72s)]
*  it is. That's a huge, huge framing for me. Yeah, so what I would say to you too, okay, and I would [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2192.48s)]
*  say to your viewers and listeners, please give Bitcoin a chance, okay? And recognize, like me, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2200.48s)]
*  Michael Saylor, perhaps the two of you and others, we did start out as skeptics about what it actually [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2207.4399999999996s)]
*  was. And until we fully understood it, we didn't gain confidence in it as being part of our [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2214.56s)]
*  investment portfolio. Can I tell you a quick Saylor story before we go on to something else? [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2220.4s)]
*  Because you'll enjoy this. Okay, so I'll be seeing Mike next week. I call Saylor. Okay, so I call [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2223.92s)]
*  Saylor and I say, Michael, I need you to write the introduction of my book. Happy to do it, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2229.2799999999997s)]
*  but I need the manuscript and I got to read the book. I got no problem. I sent him the manuscript. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2234.72s)]
*  He calls me late August and he says, Mooch. I said, yes, sir. He said, you know, I hate the [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2239.2s)]
*  last chapter of your book. I said, oh, God, whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm looking through the last. He said, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2246.08s)]
*  yeah, he goes, you say at the end of this book, after you wonderfully explain this thing, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2251.2s)]
*  and I learned a lot in this thing, actually a lot of stories that you put up, the amount of [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2256.08s)]
*  contributions, all different types of stories, I learned a lot, but your last chapter says that [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2260.24s)]
*  someone should put 2% of their money in Bitcoin. Let me ask you something. How much of your net [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2264.72s)]
*  worth is in Bitcoin? I said, Michael, 55%. He said, 55%. Okay, because you're 55% in Bitcoin. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2269.68s)]
*  So why are you recommending 2%? Let me ask you something. You said this is the best investment [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2277.8399999999997s)]
*  you've come across. Yes, Michael. Do you have 50 other investments that are as good as this? [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2282.08s)]
*  I said, no, Michael. Then why the hell are you putting 2%? I said, because I have no balls and [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2288.96s)]
*  I'm under great regulatory scrutiny as a registered investment advisor. So we rewrote the last chapter [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2294.96s)]
*  and now the last chapter regals that story. And I say, I'm at 55. I'm supposed to tell you to be at [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2301.52s)]
*  two, but you should pick a number that's good for you. Yeah. It's my largest investment. It's [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2309.04s)]
*  my largest asset myself. Salim, where is it fair in your portfolio? Yeah, for me, it's in the 40% [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2315.12s)]
*  range, 35 to 40%. What I love about it is as time goes by, the percentage of my portfolio represents [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2323.7599999999998s)]
*  increases. It's the pat man of your portfolio. It's moving up the percentages in your portfolio. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2330.96s)]
*  Fantastic. For me, the book by Jeff Booth, The Price of Tomorrow, is what nails it. Where he says [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2336.64s)]
*  we're growing the global economy with 4x the debt per dollar increase in GDP. And that just [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2344.2400000000002s)]
*  tells you everything you could possibly need to know. And I love the back to the technology framing, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2351.28s)]
*  which is that when they floated off the gold standard, they did not know that technology [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2356.7200000000003s)]
*  was deflationary. And so more advanced technologies cost a lot. Therefore, you could borrow $10 million, [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2361.44s)]
*  build a TV factory, and a year later, those TVs should be worth more or cost more. But no, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2368.56s)]
*  the TVs are worth half as much a year later. And if you borrow $10 million to chase after a [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2373.6s)]
*  deflationary technology, you're never getting your money back. It's a good point. I mean, so [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2380.0s)]
*  there's so many different reasons to own it. But I'm grateful for people like Michael Seller, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2385.04s)]
*  who have been great evangelists of it. Grateful to you, Peter. You introduced me to it. Grateful [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2389.6s)]
*  to you, Saleem. I confess I didn't understand it. And again, if you're out there, you don't [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2394.64s)]
*  understand it. Please listen to us and take the time to learn more about it. You know, Michael [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2400.7999999999997s)]
*  Seller and I were roommates at our fraternity together. Didn't you hear that? Yeah. MIT, right? [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2405.68s)]
*  You went to MIT together, right? Yeah. I'll tell you some fun stories when we're not on there. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2410.48s)]
*  Yes. So I look forward to that. We hit $94,000 per Bitcoin today. Pretty amazing, right? I was like, [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2415.2s)]
*  can I move money fast enough a few days ago to get it at $90? No. But the question is, you know, [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2424.4s)]
*  if my head of finance is listening, let's still move that money in. You know, when's the best time [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2430.32s)]
*  to buy Bitcoin? Now. Yeah, today. Yeah, yeah. As fast as you can. Yeah. And I have no interest in [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2436.8s)]
*  it other than if enough people buy it, the price goes up. But that's a different story. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2444.7200000000003s)]
*  You know, where is there any risk that you foresee? You know, we've talked about Salim on previous [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2449.12s)]
*  episodes, quantum computing, breaking various encoding, and whether we can get quantum encryption [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2455.52s)]
*  up and whether that can work. You know, you've made the point that Satoshi's wallet, which is now worth [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2462.72s)]
*  how many billions now? 70 billion? Is the greatest. No, I think it's more. Because he's got one million [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2471.2s)]
*  tokens and we're at 94. It's 94 billion. So, you know, you can think of that. So whatever it is, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2478.24s)]
*  94 billion. When that gets hacked, then it's time to work. It's the greatest X-Prize ever. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2484.08s)]
*  If you can achieve hacking Bitcoin, you get 94 billion dollars. But hold on. This is an important [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2488.96s)]
*  distinction here is you could hack the wallet, right? You could get somebody's private key, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2495.36s)]
*  but that doesn't break Bitcoin, right? So quantum encryption may solve the encryption issue, but it [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2500.08s)]
*  doesn't solve the distributed nature of the token. So you have resiliency at two levels there. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2504.96s)]
*  Well, here's what I would say to both of you guys. I would say that one thing that I would worry [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2512.32s)]
*  about, and this is an existential thing, is we, you know, listen, you've got people in the Scandinavian [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2519.36s)]
*  region of Northern Europe preparing themselves for nuclear war. Okay? And so we know that [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2531.2s)]
*  Vladimir Putin has changed his rules of engagement in terms of using a nuke. And so, you know, if [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2537.6s)]
*  we're going in that direction, it's going to hurt Bitcoin, it's going to hurt other assets, and it [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2543.3599999999997s)]
*  will put us in a situation, an unknown situation. Why? You know, so here's my question. I understand [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2548.3999999999996s)]
*  if the world was going to hell in a handbasket, I would imagine that for some degree, because you [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2556.56s)]
*  can't eat your Bitcoin, you can't eat your gold, it's better to have a farm. But to some degree, [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2564.4s)]
*  Bitcoin would seem to be the most protected asset across national boundaries. And why isn't [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2570.24s)]
*  disruption in economies and governments increasing the price of Bitcoin for security purposes? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2578.72s)]
*  So it's not about increasing or decreasing it. It's about your quality of life. And it's about [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2584.24s)]
*  your ability to use it if you needed to use it. Because if you've destabilized the global order [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2592.08s)]
*  to the point where we're irradiating each other on the planet, that is an existential threat to [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2598.16s)]
*  every part of your asset portfolio. And that's an existential threat to your standard of living [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2604.08s)]
*  and your great grandchildren's standard of living. And so we've been able to avoid this [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2610.64s)]
*  since the 1940s, because there have been rational actors in control of these warheads. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2615.6s)]
*  And you can't, you have to pray that a regional conflict, you see that the Europeans see the [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2622.64s)]
*  conflict differently than us guys. When you go to the European capitals, what do they say to you? [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2628.8799999999997s)]
*  Hitler walked into Poland in September of 1939. And it took one year, but he ended up in France, [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2634.88s)]
*  and he ended up in France in June of 40. And he ended up bombing the UK in September. And what I [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2643.44s)]
*  would say to you guys, Finland and Sweden were not members of NATO for 74 years. Yet in the 75th year, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2651.44s)]
*  they raised their hand and said, look, we'd like to join NATO. And so there's a threat going on. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2658.4s)]
*  And if that threat is nuclear, okay, yes, maybe your Bitcoin would go up because of the instability, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2664.56s)]
*  Peter, and I accept that. But you're going to have so many problems. And I'm going to have so many [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2671.84s)]
*  problems. Aline, people listening. Okay, we have to, to get to the world that Peter wants, and [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2676.88s)]
*  you've written some amazing books about this, and I often cite your books, but to get to that world [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2684.16s)]
*  of abundance and get to that world of technological advancement, where we're deepening [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2689.04s)]
*  the wealth of everyone. And I'm talking about lower middle income people, everybody's lifestyle [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2693.6s)]
*  can improve. Uplifting all of humanity. The first thing we have to do is not kill each other. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2699.12s)]
*  That's the number one priority. So we have to be engaged in civil discourse, rational discourse. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2705.92s)]
*  Okay, the bellicosity of Donald Trump's rhetoric is not beneficial. It just isn't. We can pretend [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2713.7599999999998s)]
*  that it is, and we can make allowances for him. But we can't do that any more than we can [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2720.64s)]
*  accept that we're going to lower the threshold for nuclear weaponry deployment in Europe, or [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2726.4s)]
*  potentially in the US. You've got people on national TV in Russia talking about blowing up lunch. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2733.68s)]
*  Everybody, I want to take a short break from our episode to talk about a company that's [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2739.12s)]
*  very important to me, and could actually save your life or the life of someone that you love. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2742.56s)]
*  Company is called Fountain Life. And it's a company I started years ago with Tony Robbins [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2747.92s)]
*  and a group of very talented physicians. You know, most of us don't actually know what's going on [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2753.2000000000003s)]
*  inside our body. We're all optimists. Until that day when you have a pain in your side, [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2758.88s)]
*  you go to the physician in the emergency room and they say, listen, I'm sorry to tell you this, but [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2764.4s)]
*  you have this stage three or four going on. And you know, it didn't start that morning. It probably [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2768.32s)]
*  was a problem that's been going on for some time. But because we never look, we don't find out. So [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2775.04s)]
*  what we built at Fountain Life was the world's most advanced diagnostic centers. We have four [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2781.68s)]
*  across the US today, and we're building 20 around the world. These centers give you a full body MRI, [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2787.44s)]
*  a brain, a brain vasculature, an AI enabled coronary CT looking for soft plaque, a DEXA scan, [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2794.4s)]
*  a grail blood cancer test, a full executive blood workup. It's the most advanced workup you'll ever [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2800.88s)]
*  receive. 150 gigabytes of data that then go to our AIs and our physicians to find any disease [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2807.6s)]
*  at the very beginning when it's solvable. You're going to find out eventually. You might as well [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2815.36s)]
*  find out when you can take action. Fountain Life also has an entire side of therapeutics. We look [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2820.6400000000003s)]

*  Go to fountainlife.com backslash Peter. When Tony and I wrote our New York Times bestseller [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2838.96s)]
*  Life Force, we had 30,000 people reached out to us for Fountain Life memberships. If you go to [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2846.0s)]

*  is for me one of the most important things I offer my entire family, the CEOs of my companies, [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2858.4s)]

*  All right, let's go back to our episode. There's this America first approach, Anthony, [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2877.76s)]
*  that is for me a threat to the hegemony of the dollar. If you stop being the world's policeman, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2883.84s)]
*  there's a higher chance that people stop using the dollar. Do you see that correlated and do [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2890.88s)]
*  you see that as a real threat? Of course I see that. Of course I see that correlated. I'm going [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2895.2000000000003s)]
*  to recommend a book to both of you called America First. It's by H.W. Brands. America First is the [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2899.36s)]
*  first America First movement, which was a hostile movement started by Charles Lindbergh and [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2905.28s)]
*  Father Coughlin, Huey Long. Anytime you move in that direction, you create legal instability. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2911.76s)]
*  So if we're going with America First and the America First movement challenges those system, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2921.2000000000003s)]
*  this unbelievable legal system that's very predictable in the United States, the property [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2927.6000000000004s)]
*  rights of the United States, you have impractical and unpredictable property laws in places like [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2931.92s)]
*  Russia and China because you don't have a dispassionate legal system. Okay? So you [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2941.52s)]
*  don't have the legal precedent to protect you no matter who the ruler is. So if you move in that [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2947.52s)]
*  direction, you lose dollar hegemony. Let me provide a quote to you from the Leviathan. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2952.64s)]
*  350 years ago, Thomas Hobbes wrote the following paragraph, and I'm paraphrasing, but you'll get it, [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2960.0s)]
*  what Hobbes said that the world has its greatest level of peace when one hegemon, [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2967.2s)]
*  when one hegemon with military superiority over the other nations uses the force of its military [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2973.12s)]
*  might to put down the internecine conflicts around the world. So in other words, it's a force for [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2980.56s)]
*  good. Pax Romana, Pax Britannia, whatever the vagaries are of the colonialism and stuff like [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2986.88s)]
*  that, I'm just talking about the military suppression. Okay? Pax Americana. And so what [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2993.28s)]
*  Hobbes said 350 years ago, they teach at West Point and they say that we need to be a force for [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=2999.0400000000004s)]
*  good. When Trump was talking about the, why aren't they paying their fair share, I was on the campaign [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3005.44s)]
*  plane with him in 2016. I said, Mr. President, I want to provide some historical context. Our [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3012.32s)]
*  military leadership actually did not want them to pay their fair share. And he was like, I mean, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3017.2000000000003s)]
*  what the hell are you talking about? Why is that? Well, they wanted military hegemony. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3022.88s)]
*  They wanted military superiority. They did not want Germany or Japan to rearm after the second [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3028.0s)]
*  world war. And so even though we had that treaty in 49 related to NATO, they allowed them to have [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3035.76s)]
*  that laxity so that we could be a form factor of 10 over the other people because we saw ourselves, [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3042.7200000000003s)]
*  rightly or wrongly, as a benevolent democracy. Okay? And so yes, that whole idea, that rhetoric [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3050.48s)]
*  threatens that position. Okay? And so that's why I want to be Secretary of the Constitution. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3059.2s)]
*  I think that world safety and predictability and stability, I think everybody believes that is key. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3065.2s)]
*  Let me share this quick video here. So Anthony, you're going to be on stage with me in March at [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3076.16s)]
*  the Abundance Summit. We have a two hour session on- Big honor to be invited here. Thank you. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3082.7999999999997s)]
*  A pleasure, buddy. And Kathy Wood is going to be with us as well at the summit in early March. Let [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3089.2s)]
*  me play this quick video of Kathy and let's talk about it. We have a 2030 target. In our base case, [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3095.44s)]
*  it's around $650,000. In our bull case, it's between one and $1.5 million. Now, remember, [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3102.24s)]
*  we were the first public asset manager to gain exposure to Bitcoin in 2015 at $250. And we still [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3111.12s)]
*  at $90,000. I think we have a long way to go. All right. Thoughts? Well, you know, I not only [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3120.24s)]
*  agree with her, I admire her because she was shaken to the core by the financial media in 2022 [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3127.04s)]
*  and she was unwavered. And I'm also an investor. I will fully disclose to you, I'm an ARK investor. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3134.4s)]
*  And so I have a lot of admiration for her, but I want to point out something to you. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3139.7599999999998s)]
*  What she's talking about is insignificant in terms of the overall global market capitalization of [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3143.68s)]
*  assets. So let me just explain that quickly. Yeah, let's do that. That's important. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3151.12s)]
*  Let's use the $18 trillion number, which is what the total capitalization is of gold. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3154.88s)]
*  And let's stipulate for viewers and listeners that gold is perceived as a store of value by [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3161.92s)]
*  people around the world. Okay. But there's, you know, tens, hundreds of trillions of dollars. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3168.0s)]
*  Do you still own gold? Do I own gold? Yes. I don't own gold. I don't own gold. But many people our [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3173.6800000000003s)]
*  age, Peter, do own gold. Do you know what I own? Gold is at an all-time high. Yeah. I went back in [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3179.68s)]
*  2008. This is pre my abundance mindset, exponential mindset, 2008 when the economy is being hit by the [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3185.68s)]
*  housing crisis and all these predators will call you up and say, Hey, you need to buy gold. You need [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3194.3999999999996s)]
*  to buy gold and have it available. And so I bought like, you know, a few ounces of gold just to have [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3200.72s)]
*  them in the safe so that if I ever if martial law came in, I need to go and trade gold for food, [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3207.44s)]
*  that was available. And, you know, I went on TV, I forget what it was, CNBC, I think in 2014 and 2015 [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3215.12s)]
*  and say, sell your gold, buy Bitcoin. And I wish I had sold even more and bought only Bitcoin. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3223.6s)]
*  All right. So $18 trillion. And what's the what's the total market capitalization of Bitcoin today? [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3232.96s)]
*  Also, so it's 1.9 trillion. Yeah, just under two. Yeah. Okay. I'm just under two. Okay. So we're, [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3239.04s)]
*  you know, forgive me because I'm this thing's updating every moment. But let's say it's 1.9 [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3245.6800000000003s)]
*  for the sake of this argument, if it goes 10x, it becomes an equivalent in the overall asset tabulations [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3251.12s)]
*  of the global capital equivalent to gold. Yeah. And so, you know, we know that technology, [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3259.92s)]
*  the portability, the immutability, the scarcity of Bitcoin, it should trade to a higher multiple [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3267.76s)]
*  than gold. And that's why Kathy saying her bull case one and a half million, you know, would get [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3275.36s)]
*  you to the $25 trillion number. But here's the thing that I would tell listeners, at 18 trillion, [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3281.0400000000004s)]
*  it's not even a pimple on the ass of the global economy. Does everybody understand that? Yeah, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3287.44s)]
*  gold has a 123% asset allocation, big deal. Central banks own gold. But we're talking about [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3293.2000000000003s)]
*  something at $18 trillion that is a non event in terms of the overall capital allocation. But [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3301.2000000000003s)]
*  let me tell you what's going to happen. Because I spent 35 years on Wall Street, [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3308.4s)]
*  less my 11 day fiasco in Washington. But let me tell you what's going to happen. These people [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3312.96s)]
*  are going to sell this idea to their investors. The great Wall Street sales machine, we suck at [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3318.32s)]
*  so many things on Wall Street, fellas, but selling is not one of them. And there are legions of [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3325.92s)]
*  financial advisors, there are legions of financial consultants, there are PowerPoint presentations [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3331.92s)]
*  coming out of Fidelity and BlackRock and PowerPoint commentations coming out of Galaxy [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3336.88s)]
*  that are absolutely legendary. And you're going to get people off zero. Yes. Okay, now, before you [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3342.7200000000003s)]
*  came on, Peter, Celine told me, and I don't know the answer to this, but Celine told me that he [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3350.0s)]
*  thinks approximately 20% of the Bitcoin has gone missing as a result of early adoption, somebody [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3355.6s)]
*  lost their hard drive, somebody lost their laptop. So I don't know. Let's say that's three and a half [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3363.04s)]
*  to four million Bitcoin. So you're telling me, because we've got to mine it over the next 100 [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3369.12s)]
*  years, let's say there's 19 million that we think is out there, four million is gone. We have 60 [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3375.36s)]
*  million global million heirs. We have 15 million Bitcoins. So you tell me what's going to happen. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3382.96s)]
*  I believe that this asset will trade to that million and a half dollar number. And if you get [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3392.2400000000002s)]
*  the regulation right in the deepest, most liquid capital market in the world, the United States, [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3398.7200000000003s)]
*  we have a very friendly crypto Congress coming in and a crypto president. I think this stuff happens [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3405.0400000000004s)]
*  fast. And can I say one last thing? This is very important. We're at prices right now that we should [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3411.6800000000003s)]
*  have been at in January of 22. This got suppressed by Gary Gensler. You had a approval of the Bitcoin [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3417.12s)]
*  futures ETF. The administrative law required you to approve the cash ETF right away. We didn't do [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3426.56s)]
*  that. We had to have a lawsuit with that man. And here we are now. All right. So let's react to this [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3434.0s)]
*  Washington Post headline here. Trump eyes pro crypto candidates for federal financial agencies. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3440.16s)]
*  Do you know these folks here, Anthony? What do you think of them? [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3448.08s)]
*  I do. I know Hester very well. I know Dan Gallagher. I've been on television with Dan Gallagher. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3451.12s)]
*  Christian Carlo has come to my conferences. I work with the man, Gary Gensler at Goldman Sachs. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3457.52s)]
*  Paul Atkins is actually one of my best friends from high school. I went to law school with [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3464.88s)]
*  Paul Atkins. So yes, I know those people very well. We know that Gary is obviously [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3472.96s)]
*  surprising because he did teach a class at your alma mater that was pro crypto. But he [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3479.84s)]
*  decided politically he needed to be anti-crypto. One will someday have to ask him why because he [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3485.84s)]
*  knows the promise of that technology. But those other people will be very good for the industry. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3490.88s)]
*  And here's a Fox News article here. It says Pennsylvania House introduces Bill [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3497.2000000000003s)]
*  to implement a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Talk about this one. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3503.04s)]
*  So this is monumental on so many different levels because what they're basically telling you is that [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3507.36s)]
*  this is going to be an important strategic asset globally. And they are looking at this thing. And [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3514.24s)]
*  if Kathy Wood is right, and I believe she is, you're going to buy a dollar at six cents right now. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3523.04s)]
*  If that thing goes to a million dollars, I predict it will. You can buy it at 9 cents, [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3530.72s)]
*  90 or 0.94 cents. And so yes, I think that will be the first of many. There will be [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3534.96s)]
*  a avalanche of corporates, an avalanche of sovereigns, an avalanche of states [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3544.48s)]
*  that do exactly that. And by the way, the state of Wisconsin, this is a beautiful story. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3551.76s)]
*  They put $150 million into iBit, the BlackRock ETF. And then the guy was asked, well, why the [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3556.6400000000003s)]
*  hell did you do that? He said, hey, listen, if you're not long Bitcoin, you're short Bitcoin. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3562.64s)]
*  Someday some consultants come into my office and they're going to tell me that I need to own [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3566.72s)]
*  stocks and bonds and hedge funds and private equity. And they're going to say, you need a [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3571.3599999999997s)]
*  one or 2% position in Bitcoin and I'm going to be like short Bitcoin. Why not own it now? [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3575.8399999999997s)]
*  And so when they eventually get there, I've already got my position at a lower cost basis. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3581.68s)]
*  And so that's also happening, guys. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3586.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Salim, where's this going in the long term? [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3589.68s)]
*  The stat I saw that I loved was if you put 1% of the Fortune 1000 puts their treasury in Bitcoin, [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3591.44s)]
*  just that drives it to a million dollars of Bitcoin. And I think there's a bigger picture [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3599.12s)]
*  here, which is that there's about $600 trillion in global assets, but half of that is real estate. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3603.6s)]
*  And so in that, Anthony is absolutely right. Gold is still a couple of percent on that. It's a dot [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3609.68s)]
*  on that whole picture. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3617.52s)]
*  I said it was the opportunity for being- [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3618.96s)]
*  It was a pimple on the ass of the economist. I'm trying to be graphic for you guys. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3620.48s)]
*  I'm trying to be, I'm Canadian, so I'm a little more polite. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3624.72s)]
*  It's just got so much range to go. And in the absence of anything else, a true deflationary, [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3630.24s)]
*  limited scarcity model like this gives you unbelievable upside. And again, 15 years later, [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3637.12s)]
*  nobody's found a way of hacking it. And even the guys that I know that built Cosmos and built [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3643.44s)]
*  Ethereum and so on are like, you know, we first hated the proof of work thing. So we built proof [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3648.2400000000002s)]
*  of stake networks. Now we see the proof of work as a really powerful foundation because the act of [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3652.96s)]
*  doing the work just gives you so much confidence in the foundational aspects of it. So just watching [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3658.2400000000002s)]
*  the dominoes topple everywhere that I can see around this. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3665.68s)]
*  It's unknown to the majority of the people. Okay. I went to a 35 year reunion at Goldman Sachs. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3669.04s)]
*  I started there in August of 1989. They gave me five minutes to speak. I said, [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3681.76s)]
*  guys, I just want to do a survey. How many of you in this room own Bitcoin? [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3687.12s)]
*  Nobody. How many of you have kids that own Bitcoin? [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3692.7200000000003s)]
*  Maybe three or four. And there was 150 people in the room. And so it's so early and it's so scarce. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3696.48s)]
*  Okay. And then when somebody says it's rat poison, Buffett says it's rat poison, [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3708.32s)]
*  it's rat poison scare. But ask him, has he done any work on it? Does he understand the technical [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3712.24s)]
*  properties that you've described? Does he understand where it fits in terms of the Neil Ferguson [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3718.64s)]
*  checklist of how we think about money and stores of value? Okay. This thing is technologically [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3725.68s)]
*  perfect for that. And that's not my quote. That's Michael Saylor's. I understand, but people, [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3732.64s)]
*  what you just said, there's only 5% global adoption. This is where web one was in 1999. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3738.96s)]
*  What you just said, 95% of the available investors does not know. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3746.7999999999997s)]
*  Let me give an example. I'm sorry, Peter. Go ahead. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3751.92s)]
*  No problem. I talk about what I call the 6 D's, which is a way to think about and predict the [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3754.0800000000004s)]
*  impact of technology on different industries. Anything you can digitize enters a period of [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3760.4s)]
*  very slow deceptive growth and eventually disrupts. And along the way it dematerializes, [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3766.1600000000003s)]
*  it demonetizes and it democratizes. Right? So we've seen that the first 3D printers where [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3772.2400000000002s)]
*  these little cross-linking with ultraviolet light, stereolithography, and it was very slow [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3780.64s)]
*  and very deceptive in the beginning. And now we're 3D printing entire rockets, we're 3D [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3788.48s)]
*  printing homes. It's disrupting industries. The Kodak digital camera that was devised in Kodak [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3793.12s)]
*  Labs was 0.01 megapixels originally, then 0.02, then 0.04, and 0.08. All looked like zero. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3801.76s)]
*  And Kodak ignored the digital camera and it put them out of business when it digitized and [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3810.4s)]
*  dematerialized and then democratized where these things, we have happy snaps now in the trillions. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3816.32s)]
*  And so what we're seeing here is that Bitcoin is in the same area. It was deceptive in the very [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3822.6400000000003s)]
*  beginning, right? When it was going for pennies to dollars, 300 bucks, it was insignificant. Well, [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3828.8s)]
*  guess what? It's now at $100,000 almost there. It's becoming disruptive. And it has dematerialized [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3835.04s)]
*  our financial systems, dematerialized banks and traders and exchanges, and it's democratizing [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3843.76s)]
*  access. So I think this is just one of the normal transitions that we're seeing in this [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3852.8s)]
*  exponential growth curve across industries. Salim, I am curious, a decade from now, [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3860.0s)]
*  is Bitcoin something which is what nations are basing their reserves on, what companies are basing [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3867.92s)]
*  the reserves on, how fast are we going to see this transformation? And there is a point at which it [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3878.0s)]
*  flips in which you need to have what you're doing based on a Bitcoin platform. When do you think [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3885.36s)]
*  that's coming? Every treasury secretary in the world is looking at this now, right? And every Fed [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3893.52s)]
*  and every central bank, they can't not look at it. At some point, the braver ones will start over. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3898.64s)]
*  And then you're right, it will be a flipping point and then the whole thing will go. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3903.6s)]
*  I was asking Jeff Booth about this, right? Because the key question is when do we hit that little [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3907.7599999999998s)]
*  tipping point? He's like, which snowflake creates the final snowflake that has the avalanche come [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3912.3199999999997s)]
*  down? It's hard to predict that one. All you know is the avalanche is going to happen. And so you [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3917.2s)]
*  basically bet on the avalanche on that sense. I think this is, I would say it takes about another [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3922.4s)]
*  year or two in the middle of some of this uncertainty we're dealing with and people go, [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3929.7599999999998s)]
*  oh my God, I have to be in it. And then it'll just start a cascade from there. That's my rough guess. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3934.16s)]
*  You know, I agree. I guess the only thing I wanted to say from an example point of view is you are [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3939.3599999999997s)]
*  going to have a permissionless based transfer of wealth system. And so when I went to Rome for the [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3947.92s)]
*  first time, I was 21, it was 39 years ago. I waited in line at the post office to buy a calling card [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3954.8s)]
*  to call my mom. It was 15 US dollars. Okay. And it gave me five minutes of calling time, three dollars [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3961.6800000000003s)]
*  a minute. Now I can go to Rome, I can log into any internet cafe and I can FaceTime my mom for no [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3969.84s)]
*  dollars a minute. Or any Wi-Fi. So to understand what, yeah, so what's going to understand, [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3977.44s)]
*  understand what's going to happen. You have seven trillion dollars that we're spending globally [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3983.84s)]
*  to verify transactions, to codify transactions, credit card fees, wire fees, all different types [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3990.8s)]
*  of ancillary third party verification that ends with this cryptology, that ends with this blockchain. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=3998.32s)]
*  And said differently, two guys came to see me from El Salvador, economic advisors to the president. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4007.04s)]
*  They said if we can set up a wallet to wallet transfer, we have 15 million expats in the US. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4013.6s)]
*  They want to send money to their parents or family. They've got to go to Western Union. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4019.12s)]
*  10 cents on a dollar goes to Western Union. So if a thousand, they're all unbanked guys, [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4024.8s)]
*  they're all unbanked. 10 cents goes to Western Union, 90 cents goes to mom and dad. They would [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4030.0s)]
*  say $400 million a year with a wallet to wallet transfer, okay, over the blockchain. So you guys [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4036.0s)]
*  know, because you're technologists, when it works better, it's more efficient and it saves money, [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4045.12s)]
*  it gets adopted. And even if the government doesn't like it, the government hated, [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4050.88s)]
*  government hated Uber. Who liked Uber? The people liked Uber. Yeah, I talk about countries that made [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4054.7200000000003s)]
*  Uber illegal as the anti-technology nations you don't want to start your startup in. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4061.12s)]
*  We're seeing a- Can I do a quick side story on Uber just for that? Of course. Of course. Yeah, [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4069.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm gonna, by the way, I have Travis, the founder of Uber, is going to be speaking at Abundance [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4076.24s)]
*  360 as well. And we're going to be talking about Moonshot. So you'll have a chance to ask him [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4082.96s)]
*  or tell these additional stories. So a few years ago, one of my community members says, [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4088.16s)]
*  hey, can you help me? I've got a meeting with the finance minister of France. And I would love some [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4093.6s)]
*  guidance. I'm like, yeah, what's he going to meet about? He says, yeah, he's got one question, [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4098.0s)]
*  which is how did he shut down Uber? Because the taxis go on strike, the buses go on strike, [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4101.76s)]
*  the airport goes on strike, the president yells at him, his life's a mess. So he's like, I need [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4107.68s)]
*  to figure out a way of shutting down Uber. So we have five minutes of research. And around Paris, [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4111.76s)]
*  you have the Bonlieu, these suburbs of North African horrible drug crime infested neighborhoods. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4115.6s)]
*  It turns out the French government has spent $40 billion over the decades trying to solve that [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4123.360000000001s)]
*  problem with zero outcome, except over that 18 months previous because of Uber, crime rates have [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4127.76s)]
*  dropped 10x because they're all out driving. So this guy's trying to shut down the thing that's [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4133.200000000001s)]
*  saving him a $40 billion problem. And those are the little ancillary benefits that people don't [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4139.68s)]
*  see when you see this type of systemic change. It's incredible. How do you think about the age [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4145.44s)]
*  curve for Bitcoin adoption, Anthony? Is it something that younger adopt it faster? Is it a [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4151.679999999999s)]
*  generational issue right now? No question. Our generation, me and you, okay, I don't know how [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4166.0s)]
*  old Salim is, but you're an old bastard, as am I. By the way, you look fantastic. What are you? [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4172.64s)]
*  80, 90? I'm thinking of all the supplements you gave me 10 years ago. I'm 95 years old. I think [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4178.240000000001s)]
*  I look great for 95. You're amazing. And by the way, my face is pinned back, Salim, my face is [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4183.360000000001s)]
*  pinned back like Joan Rivers. I've got enough Botox in my face to kill a snake. You follow what I'm [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4188.8s)]
*  saying? But I am taking the Peter Diamandis cocktail of supplements that he suggested to me [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4194.240000000001s)]
*  about eight years ago, just so you know. But I think our generation is going to miss it, [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4200.56s)]
*  frankly. Again, like I said, 6% adoption globally. If you're 60, you're not buying Bitcoin 20 years [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4208.240000000001s)]
*  from now at 80. I think our generation is going to miss it. Some people will get it. There are [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4215.360000000001s)]
*  people in our generation, Howard Marks told me he hated Bitcoin. Obviously, the CEO of Oak Tree, [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4220.400000000001s)]
*  multi-billionaire, but his son got him into it. So there will be a group of people from the 30 [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4226.24s)]
*  years junior to us that knock on the melons of their parents and say, hey, I don't know what [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4232.48s)]
*  you're doing, but you have to have some of this in your portfolio. I asked my mom, God bless her, [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4238.0s)]
*  she's 88. And I said, where are you putting your distributions? And, you know, show me your [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4242.4s)]
*  portfolio. I said, you got to put it into Bitcoin. Mom, please do that. And she calls me back and she [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4246.88s)]
*  says, my financial advisor, Morgan Stanley, won't allow it. And they don't have a mechanism [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4253.12s)]
*  for doing it. And I'm like, that's immoral. I mean, it pisses me off. I said, change financial advisors. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4259.2s)]
*  You know, there's something happening in the younger generation that is really fascinating, [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4266.5599999999995s)]
*  because I've been dragged into this entire NFT world over the last two, three years. And you sit [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4270.72s)]
*  in these Discord channels where they're trading NFTs and now trading ordinals and whatever. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4275.5199999999995s)]
*  And what's fascinating is you never ever, ever, ever hear the word US dollar. It's all Ethereum [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4280.56s)]
*  or it's all Bitcoin. So the unit of account for this next generation is not tied to the dollar. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4286.400000000001s)]
*  For us and everybody older than us, the only thing we ever knew was the dollar. And therefore, [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4292.88s)]
*  there's something really big because a mindset shift is that that state change is going to allow [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4297.200000000001s)]
*  them to be flexible as to what they view as where their stores of value are. I think that's a [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4302.8s)]
*  game changer for the next generation. I have a question for both of you guys. I agree with that. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4307.6s)]
*  You go ahead. So I remember in 2017, as Bitcoin was peaking back then, everybody was buying and [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4312.160000000001s)]
*  trading shitcoins 24 hours a day. Right. It was and I looked in my my treasure, you know, hard [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4321.68s)]
*  wallet and said, I have all these coins, you know, half are dead. A few are still sort of like, [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4330.320000000001s)]
*  you know, barely alive. What do you think about anything other than Bitcoin? What do you think [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4335.44s)]
*  of Ethereum? What do you think of other cryptocurrencies? Is there anything else worth [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4341.2s)]
*  looking at? You know, so listen, I, I, I'm a big believer in Solana as a as a utility token, [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4347.44s)]
*  as a layer one utility token. It's, it's got properties I like. It's very fast, low gas fees. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4354.4s)]
*  It's easy to build on. It has a big TVL, big community. And I imagine a day to Salim's point [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4361.599999999999s)]
*  about we lived in a dollar based world, but now our kids don't live in that world. I'm going to [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4369.76s)]
*  imagine a day five years from now where this phone that I'm holding is going to have a tokenized [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4376.4s)]
*  version of my Disney stock, a tokenized version of Walmart, a tokenized version of Starbucks. It'll [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4381.599999999999s)]
*  likely be on Solana. I walk into Starbucks and they say to me, Hey, we're having a share repurchase [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4387.04s)]
*  going on here. And so that $4 coffee, we're going to give it to you for $3 and 50 cents, [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4393.5199999999995s)]
*  but can we take a sliver of your stock out of your portfolio from your phone? Or the same thing could [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4398.48s)]
*  be happening at Walmart or Home Depot. And I think that stuff is going to happen on Ethereum or Solana. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4405.92s)]
*  Okay. But I like Solana better because I just think Solana is a better mousetrap for speed [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4412.72s)]
*  and for cost. Now, you guys know there was Ask Jeeves, there was Alta Vista, there was all kinds [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4419.76s)]
*  of search engines to get access to the internet before Google showed up. And so maybe I'm wrong. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4427.76s)]
*  Maybe there's something out there that's going to be a better operating system than them. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4432.8s)]
*  But I do think that over the next 10 years, I think they will do well. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4436.72s)]
*  Saleem, how do you think about Ethereum, Solana? [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4440.56s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. I've got a slight extension to that, which what I'm hearing right now, [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4443.76s)]
*  talking to the various folks in the crypto trading world, is you're going to have Bitcoin [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4449.360000000001s)]
*  for being safe. You're going to have meme coins for gambling. And the utility tokens become less [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4455.04s)]
*  relevant from a gambling perspective, but much more relevant from a [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4462.160000000001s)]
*  solid bet on certain use cases, as Anthony just mentioned. So I think you end up with three [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4466.72s)]
*  categories. Meme coins to do, you know, trying to get 100X on something. The utility tokens where [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4472.4800000000005s)]
*  people are excited to have Filecoin because of that use case or Solana for payments or whatever. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4478.64s)]
*  And then Bitcoin is the safe place to be. Yeah, it's worth noting Dogecoin surged 150% [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4483.92s)]
*  since the election day, right? So Dogecoin spikes after Trump announces Department of Doge. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4490.08s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, I mean, that's Elon. I mean, that's his gift. You know what I mean? Listen, I mean, [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4496.96s)]
*  the guy is a brilliant guy. He's going to out-AI all the AI people. He's going to out-bore [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4500.48s)]
*  the tunnel people. But he's done it over and over again. He's done it over and over again. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4508.5599999999995s)]
*  He's the man. Listen, he's the man. I guess my only thing with Elon, I'm not a friend of his, [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4514.4s)]
*  but my only thing with Elon, we all have blind spots in life. And you are an ancient Greek, [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4520.96s)]
*  Peter. And you know that the gods have gifted us with many different things. But they take [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4526.32s)]
*  certain things too from us. And I'm telling you, you got to be very wary of Donald Trump because [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4532.48s)]
*  he's hurt a lot of people, a lot of people. Forget about me. There's a lot of people in his [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4539.52s)]
*  wake. And Elon has got a great life. He's built some amazing businesses. And I know he wants to [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4544.0s)]
*  help the country. I wanted to help the country. And I wish him well. And I hope he'll be unbelievably [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4550.72s)]
*  successful. But you got to be careful in the midst of that man. Real quick, I've been getting the [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4555.6s)]
*  most unusual compliments lately on my skin. Truth is, I use a lotion every morning and every night [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4562.72s)]
*  religiously called One Skin. It was developed by four PhD women who determined a 10 amino acid [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4569.44s)]
*  sequence that is a synolytic that kills senile cells in your skin. And this literally reverses [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4576.4s)]
*  the age of your skin. And I think it's one of the most incredible products. I use it all the time. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4583.12s)]
*  If you're interested, check out the show notes. I've asked my team to link to it below. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4589.12s)]
*  All right, let's get back to the episode. By the way, I think it is worth noting that Elon's [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4592.799999999999s)]
*  points of view here, he honestly believes them. I don't see these as, maybe I'm naive, [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4598.48s)]
*  but I don't see them as manipulations. I mean, he honestly believes that X was required to [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4605.36s)]
*  enable truthful conversations. He honestly believes that Tesla is important for a global [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4613.12s)]
*  electric economy, that SpaceX is going to make us a multi-planetary species. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4619.12s)]
*  He's got enough money. He's driven by doing things that he finds meaningful. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4625.28s)]
*  And so I was surprised by his jumping into the election as much as he did. I mean, [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4629.679999999999s)]
*  he bet everything. He went all in. Well, I mean, listen, again, he helped Trump [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4634.32s)]
*  tremendously, particularly in Pennsylvania. And I want him to help Trump. I hope Trump listens to [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4639.36s)]
*  him. The problem with Trump, though, if Elon gets a little bit more famous than him, or blah, blah, [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4646.96s)]
*  he's going to hit with the ray gun. That's what happens. Trump said something the other night, [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4652.16s)]
*  and I laughed. He was at the America First Policy Institute dinner. And he said, Bobby, Bobby, [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4656.32s)]
*  you're getting more famous than me, Bobby. Don't get too famous. And that's the sentence before [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4665.2s)]
*  he hits you with the fucking ray gun. I mean, that's the sentence. And I've seen him do it to [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4671.2s)]
*  so many people. So I hope that doesn't happen. You know, JD Vance since the election, look at me. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4675.84s)]
*  JD, are you down there? JD, where are you? JD. Because JD's smart. He's like, this is Trump's [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4685.12s)]
*  show. Let me get the fuck out of here, man. JD, you want to do an interview? No, no, I'm good. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4693.28s)]
*  JD. Where are you, JD? He's got the fucking Waldo hat on now, Peter. You know what I'm saying? Where's [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4698.639999999999s)]
*  Waldo? Wow. You learned a lot in those 11 days, didn't you? I remember I worked for him for nine [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4707.5199999999995s)]
*  months. I traveled around on a plane with him. I remember when your son brought me in. You know, [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4717.44s)]
*  you used to really piss him off, Reince Priebus. Your Greek friend, Reince Priebus, he used to [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4723.12s)]
*  really piss him off. Because the way I'm talking to the two of you, I would talk to Trump like that. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4726.16s)]
*  And Priebus didn't understand that because he was like a major, you know, DC ass kisser. And he was [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4731.68s)]
*  like, how the hell is he talking to Trump like that? And the truth is, we're New Yorkers. You know? [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4736.639999999999s)]
*  I have a framing I'd love to bounce off of you, Anthony. You know, in an ideal world, you end up [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4742.48s)]
*  with win-win outcomes. And my concern with at least the way Trump has been in the past is there's no [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4747.68s)]
*  win-win. Everything's win-lose. And if you play the game, you're going to lose. So best not to play [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4753.92s)]
*  the game would be the outcome there. And that's why lots of very smart people don't want to get [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4758.72s)]
*  involved. Do you agree with that? Don't agree with that? Well, yes, I do agree with that. But I don't [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4763.84s)]
*  agree with that very smart people don't want to get involved because Elon's probably one of the [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4769.4400000000005s)]
*  smartest people on the planet. People are intoxicated to get involved. And if I will tell you guys, [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4773.84s)]
*  and I will confess this to you, and again, going back to the ancient Greeks, right, my pride and [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4780.0s)]
*  my ego will be my mortal enemy. And so my wife hates Donald Trump almost as much as Melania hates [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4785.84s)]
*  him. And that's way up here. Okay. And crazy hatred. And she told me not to do it. But I did it [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4792.72s)]
*  because I was my ego talk and I needed to go work for the president. I built a business, I went to [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4800.48s)]
*  Harvard, I got to go work for, I got to work in the White House. And there was a guy, I can't tell [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4806.4s)]
*  you his name, but you would really respect this. He got a big appointment and he called me in [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4812.48s)]
*  December and he said, I'm withdrawing my name. I said, what? Yeah, I'm enjoying that. Yeah, I met [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4818.24s)]
*  with Trump three or four times and it dawned on me that I'm going to get hurt and this is going to [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4824.08s)]
*  hurt my family. And I'm putting my ego in the right place and I'm pulling myself out of the position. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4828.639999999999s)]
*  And I was like, wow, this guy, so stupid. How could he do something like that? He was right, [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4836.879999999999s)]
*  Salim. I was wrong. He was right. And sometimes the big lesson in investing, the big lesson in life, [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4843.599999999999s)]
*  get your pride and your ego out of your decision making. Be self-aware. My wife said to me, [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4851.04s)]
*  you and Trump on a campaign, no problem. Two jackasses going back and forth with each other. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4858.48s)]
*  Him as president of the United States, you working for him, you're going to be in a nightmare. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4864.4s)]
*  Because he wants now, there's nobody talking to Trump the way we're talking right now. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4869.679999999999s)]
*  Nobody. Nobody. I tell you, I believe, I know a lot of people that are still working with him. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4874.719999999999s)]
*  They call me all the time. Nobody sitting there with the straight shot to really have the hash out. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4880.4s)]
*  All right. I'm going on to next subject here. We've covered this one before and in full respect. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4886.639999999999s)]
*  We've crashed it to death. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4892.88s)]
*  RFK, coming in, health and human services, reinventing our food system, our medical system, [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4894.88s)]
*  our health care system. I mean, first of all, our food system is killing us. Let me just [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4902.72s)]
*  put that on the record. I think that we are being destroyed. We're being manipulated. The fact that [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4907.92s)]
*  kids' cereals don't have black box warnings on them for the amount of sugars in there is just [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4914.64s)]
*  pathetic. Just cheap, salty, sugary foods for the poorest, it's sinful for us to have that as our [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4919.679999999999s)]
*  baseline. We need a reinvention of the entire health care system. How do you think RFK is going [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4929.44s)]
*  to serve and fare in this? That's the first question. The second question I want to put out [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4938.96s)]
*  there is deregulation. I'm in the health and biotech industry. I invest a lot of biotech [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4944.32s)]
*  companies. I've started a number of biotech companies and it has been just destroyed by [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4950.799999999999s)]
*  regulation. The FDA's thesis is we're not happy until you're not happy. Doing anything new and [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4956.4s)]
*  novel is effectively illegal or super hard because you're penalized for something you approve [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4963.2s)]
*  that kills one person and you are not penalized for something you don't approve [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4971.200000000001s)]
*  that is killing hundreds of people in that disease category. Let's talk about RFK and deregulation. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4976.96s)]
*  Who wants to go first? I respect Bobby. Full disclosure, like you, he helped me on the Bitcoin [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4984.400000000001s)]
*  book. I've helped Bobby politically. Again, we can talk about the vaccine situation with Bobby. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4990.72s)]
*  Some of the things he's saying make sense. Perhaps people in the medical community would [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=4999.92s)]
*  challenge some of the things he's saying. I'm going to lead that to the medical community. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5003.6s)]
*  I speak as a dad. I believe everything that you just said and I've experienced it, Peter. If I go [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5007.76s)]
*  to Greece and I eat food, I lose weight. If I go to Italy and I eat food or drink coffee, I lose weight. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5013.76s)]
*  If I eat food here, the same food, I gain weight because there's so many preservatives and so much [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5021.84s)]
*  nonsensical stuff in this stuff. We did something in the country, which is why I want to be secretary [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5027.76s)]
*  of the Constitution. Citizens United has corrupted the country because if I'm big food or big pharma, [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5033.4400000000005s)]
*  let me light up everybody in the Congress and then let me tell everybody in the Congress that I need [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5042.16s)]
*  to put fertilizer and additives and preservatives in the food so I can cheapen up the manufacturing [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5046.56s)]
*  of the food. Yes, cheapen up the price to your point, but it stays on the shelf for 15 years [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5053.52s)]
*  and it makes everybody fat. Now, you know because you're a scientist and a doctor. If we went back [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5059.68s)]
*  to our obesity levels in 1991, we'd save two, you want to talk about two trillion dollars? [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5064.88s)]
*  We would save two trillion dollars in healthcare expenses if we just went back to the portion [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5071.84s)]
*  sizes and we just cleaned up the food. So by the way, I think that is the biggest savings [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5077.200000000001s)]
*  we can have is in our healthcare costs. Right, but yeah. Of course. So Bobby talking about this and if Bobby [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5082.64s)]
*  can implement this, I want a bronze statue to Bobby in front of the FDA. Okay, and Bobby, Bobby, [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5090.320000000001s)]
*  whatever you think of Bobby, Bobby's been on this for three decades, fellas. Yeah, okay. I think he's [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5100.0s)]
*  amazing. And he's right about this. So you tell me, I want Bobby to get that job. I know there's some [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5105.76s)]
*  establishing people that don't want him to get that job, but if Bobby's in that job, but you know [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5112.24s)]
*  what I told you about the grind in Washington, right? They'll find something on them. They're [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5117.76s)]
*  going to grind that guy. You know, we need 20 people going into that department with Bobby that [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5121.84s)]
*  think like Bobby. Do you understand what I'm saying? Because I do. Unfortunately, because I have an 11 [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5128.4s)]
*  day PhD in Washington scumbaggery. Okay, I have an honorary doctorate. And what I'm telling you is that [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5134.0s)]
*  he can't do it alone. He needs a legion of Bobby's to help him. Yeah. So I agree with everything you [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5141.44s)]
*  said. I think Citizens United has been a real nightmare for the country. Terrible. I think the [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5149.04s)]
*  issue- It's a constitutional amendment to reform that. Yeah, that's a huge problem. And the problem [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5154.48s)]
*  I think we have is that it doesn't matter whether it's Bobby Kennedy or somebody else. Yes, he's got [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5159.44s)]
*  an unbelievable track record of environmental fighting, corporate interests, et cetera. And [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5165.12s)]
*  God help us, we need 10x more of that. But how much can he do to undo the regulatory capture [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5169.28s)]
*  in both healthcare and in food? And we need that. And it may need to happen at a level above. And [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5175.84s)]
*  the best thing we could do is just educate the population that this is really what you're doing [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5182.16s)]
*  today is really bad and let the market drive changes. So you and I agree. What I would say [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5186.08s)]
*  to Bobby, you got to go district to district. There's 435 of them. And you got to do podcasts, [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5190.639999999999s)]
*  local radio, and you got to do local media. And you got to get to Peter and Salim's family in every [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5198.24s)]
*  district and say, please call your congressman. Please call your congresswoman. Knock off the [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5205.2s)]
*  relationship with Big Food. Michelle Obama- And by the way, if Bobby is listening, please come on [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5212.639999999999s)]
*  moonshots. I would love to have it because what you're planning to do is an incredible moonshot. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5218.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. He's the man. And I totally respect him. But I'm just saying to you, Michelle Obama tried [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5222.5599999999995s)]
*  this in 09. And in 2010, they crucified her. They started calling her Michael Obama. They put all [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5228.799999999999s)]
*  kinds of conspiracy theories out on the internet. That was Big Food and Big Sugar that went after [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5235.599999999999s)]
*  Michelle Obama. There's a great documentary about this. A couple of years ago, I sent you the link. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5242.719999999999s)]
*  But they crucified her. And he wanted to win reelection. So they backed off the food safety [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5246.72s)]
*  standards in the country. But that's why she had a garden in the White House. She was growing her own [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5255.2s)]
*  stuff to feed her children. We shouldn't be doing that in this country. It's too rich and too [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5260.8s)]
*  successful of a country. Just use the European playbook on this stuff. Let's talk about deregulation [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5266.16s)]
*  a little bit because right now, if I want access to stem cells and various regenerative medicine [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5271.2s)]
*  treatments, I'm flying down to Costa Rica or Mexico or other parts outside the United States [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5276.64s)]
*  to get access to that, which I think is kind of insane. Now, does there more research needed? [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5282.8s)]
*  Sure. But at the end of the day, we have enough data to say there's a reasonable level of safety. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5288.64s)]
*  And if I'm an intelligent adult, I should have the ability to access these regenerative medical [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5295.52s)]
*  treatments instead of having to leave the country. I also saw, as we all have, the biotech stocks just [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5302.32s)]
*  going down a whirlpool, down the drain over the last few years with short sellers. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5309.679999999999s)]
*  So I'm hoping and believing that we're going to see deregulation really ignite a new health [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5313.92s)]
*  dividend for biotech. How do you feel about that, Anthony? [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5323.28s)]
*  Yeah, listen, I mean, a couple of things I would say to you that, again, once again, Big Pharma, [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5328.160000000001s)]
*  because Big Pharma is putting pressure on the FDA. MDMA, which Bobby is a proponent of, and I [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5334.080000000001s)]
*  believe, Peter, you've helped my son with his MDMA projects. Yes, I think MDMA is a incredible... [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5340.88s)]
*  Yeah, for people who don't know, MDMA is a psychoactive drug. It's been used over and over [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5348.320000000001s)]
*  again with people who have severe trauma to overcome that trauma, to do it in a beautiful [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5354.72s)]
*  and graceful way. So anyway, please go back to what you were saying. No, I'm just saying that, [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5362.320000000001s)]
*  hello, FDA, how are you? Yeah, this is Pfizer. Do you guys want a job here at Pfizer in two years? [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5368.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, yes, we do. Okay, stop MDMA. Hello, this is Pfizer. We don't own everything related to [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5374.240000000001s)]
*  stem cells yet, and so we don't want those approved in the United States. You've got to [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5382.32s)]
*  go to Costa Rica or Panama. Okay, no problem. And so, oh, semi-glutide, which you know is a peptide, [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5386.5599999999995s)]
*  okay, that's always been available. Once they license it and once they made it a drug, let's [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5394.639999999999s)]
*  use it. But these other peptides, like the 157 peptide or others, sorry, can't use it because [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5400.08s)]
*  it's too universal. So this is where Bobby's going with all this. And so, yeah, I think it's [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5407.12s)]
*  unfair and I think it's wrong and I think it's hurting the country. And we weren't like that, [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5413.2s)]
*  Peter. You know, when Jonas Salk came up with the vaccine, he open sourced it. They didn't make any [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5419.2s)]
*  money off it. We weren't like that. Okay, and we have to go back to that sort of standard in the [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5426.88s)]
*  country. And so that's why, you know, look, whatever you think of Donald Trump, Bobby Kennedy [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5433.04s)]
*  is not going to be the secretary of Health and Human Services without Donald Trump. So I spent [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5440.32s)]
*  a few moments shitting on him and some of his rhetoric, but as a disrupter, I give him credit [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5447.44s)]
*  in that area. I want to be fair and objective. I want Bobby to succeed. And if Bobby's proven [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5453.92s)]
*  wrong about a vaccine or this, that, or the other thing, a Mersol, whatever he's talking about, [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5460.0s)]
*  okay, let's prove that wrong. Let's get the data together. Yes, get the data. Yeah, 100%. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5465.04s)]
*  I do agree that one of the policies that Trump put forward and whether it was him or his advisors, [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5470.32s)]
*  that you can't regulate an industry and then jump into that industry after you retire. I mean, [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5474.96s)]
*  that is absolutely, it's a ridiculous farce. Yeah. I think this goes straight back to the [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5482.08s)]
*  previous conversation on how do you get big corporate interests out of the regulatory [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5489.84s)]
*  and it's a systemic issue. Hopefully, if there's somebody that could do it, it would be Bobby [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5494.64s)]
*  Kennedy because he's got a track record of that. Hopefully he has enough of a stick to be able to [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5499.76s)]
*  do it effectively. So, you know, listen, we have overstayed our welcome here, Anthony, on your [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5504.48s)]
*  schedule, but, and we haven't covered AI. I'm thrilled to talk to both of you. I want to have [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5510.32s)]
*  you back here on WTF Just Happened in Tech on our Moonshots podcast because I love your New York [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5516.0s)]
*  attitude. It's like, you know, and your hair is just amazing. You tell me when, man. Okay, well, [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5523.759999999999s)]
*  I appreciate you too, brother. I appreciate you too. And your son, AJ, is doing amazing. You do. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5530.639999999999s)]
*  You got to call it as you see it. Yeah. When you see my son the next time, say, [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5538.56s)]
*  AJ, when you were walking on the beach at age eight, what did your dad say about your footprints? [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5546.4800000000005s)]
*  I will ask him. You want to hear what I said? Well, sure. What do you say? Yeah. Okay. See, [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5553.4400000000005s)]
*  he's afraid for me to tell you on the podcast. Okay. So you ask him. You ask him. All right. I [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5557.52s)]
*  will ask him. Wait, I want to know. When he shuts the recording off, I'll tell you. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5562.08s)]
*  You know, there's so much that's happened in this last month in AI and humanoid robotics and space. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5568.8s)]
*  It's pretty extraordinary. I think people need to realize we live during the most extraordinary [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5576.96s)]
*  time ever in human history. You know, our ancestors would view us as gods. And I hope that what we're [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5581.2s)]
*  going to see over the next four years is the roaring 20s, that we're going to see the amount [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5589.04s)]
*  of capital flowing in, the amount of ease that entrepreneurs have to reinvent, you know, AI [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5594.64s)]
*  and robot and humanoid robotics can truly bring about an age of abundance. And as the secretary [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5601.76s)]
*  of abundance, I'm going to be pushing that as hard as I can. Salim, remind me what your [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5606.48s)]
*  cabinet post is here again. I've forgotten now in the richness of this conversation, [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5612.24s)]
*  but it would be in the constitutional amendment. Oh, you're on Doge. You're going to jump into [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5617.92s)]
*  Doge. Yeah. You said Doge. You said Doge before. But yeah, I did. But after hearing the difficulties, [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5623.04s)]
*  you have to lift up to the higher level to fix it and then you can come back down again. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5631.04s)]
*  That's the truth. And there's two things we need. Number one, we need a constitutional [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5635.04s)]
*  amendment to fix Citizens United. We've created a separate but equal democracy. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5640.0s)]
*  Money matters more than it should in the society. Trump will say, no, I spent less than her and I [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5645.36s)]
*  beat her. It's not that it's in the Congress. Since January 2010, that decision was rendered. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5651.28s)]
*  The Congress is all about corporate welfare. The Congress is all about doing what big business [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5658.08s)]
*  wants it to do. Very, very bad for our society. Got to get back to the people. Second amendment, [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5663.12s)]
*  second big amendment that we need. So that would be the 28th. And the 29th amendment is to end [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5669.36s)]
*  gerrymandering. Has to be ended. Please, yes. Sorry. Yes, 100%. You got to get these congressional [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5674.56s)]
*  districts to look like the geometric shapes that we could recognize from ninth grade geometry, [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5680.160000000001s)]
*  not the jigsaw puzzle nonsense that we have now. And guess what would happen? You would liquidate [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5686.320000000001s)]
*  the extremists and you would liquidate the long tenured servants because, you know, hey, man, [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5691.120000000001s)]
*  you got to get in the middle. These are marketing competitions, guys. I love the term limits idea [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5698.240000000001s)]
*  for Congress. How about getting rid of the electoral college and just going to a straight [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5702.48s)]
*  democratic vote of 330 million Americans? Will that ever happen? I don't want that. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5708.08s)]
*  You don't? Why not? I don't want that. No, no, because remember what the system is. It's a [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5714.639999999999s)]
*  republic. And so the system is designed to have representation, but to prevent mob rule. Okay, [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5720.24s)]
*  you have to have things in place to protect minority voters. I'm not talking about black [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5728.88s)]
*  or brown people. I'm talking about the election was won 41 to, you know, 51 to 49. You got to [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5734.88s)]
*  protect the 49. And the founders understood that the electoral college does that masterfully. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5742.56s)]
*  Now, people are upset with it because the last couple of elections, the electoral college [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5749.92s)]
*  was diverging from the popular vote. But that works. If you don't do that, [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5754.72s)]
*  these candidates will sit in the coastal cities and they'll go for the popular vote. And the [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5761.84s)]
*  middle of this country will be ignored by those candidates. And I'm telling you guys, [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5767.36s)]
*  you don't want that. We've already got enough strain in the country. Trust the three to 250 year [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5773.28s)]
*  mechanism of the electoral college. It maybe hasn't worked perfectly in the last 20 years, [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5780.96s)]
*  but trust it over the next 50. But Anthony, the candidates right now are focusing on five states [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5785.68s)]
*  or Pennsylvania. I mean, how real is that? I disagree. Donald Trump went to California. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5792.5599999999995s)]
*  Donald Trump did three rallies in New York state. Donald Trump did a rally in New Jersey. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5800.88s)]
*  Donald Trump was trying to win the popular vote as well as the electoral college vote. Yes, [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5806.719999999999s)]
*  that was a playbook for eight, 12, 16, and perhaps 20. That wasn't the 24 playbook. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5813.44s)]
*  And by the way, pay attention, you may dislike Trump or like Trump. He's a formidable political [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5822.799999999999s)]
*  beast and he was playing to win the popular vote. He went to states that he couldn't win [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5829.28s)]
*  to improve his margins in those states and to help the representatives that were running [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5836.96s)]
*  down ballot from him. Yeah. I can say about Elon, I would never bet against Elon [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5842.48s)]
*  ever, right? What he did with XAI going from raising $6 billion on day one to building out [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5847.599999999999s)]
*  his colossus cluster in 122 days and blowing away the competition and now doubling it again in size. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5854.64s)]
*  And I think the same thing for Trump. You're not going to bet against him. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5861.6s)]
*  He's talented, but you got to check his rhetoric, my friend. I'm just telling you, [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5864.160000000001s)]
*  as a citizen that loves the country, and I certainly love the promise of Elon Musk, [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5870.160000000001s)]
*  and I hope Elon Musk lives to be 150, and I hope he's worth $10 trillion because he's adding [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5875.200000000001s)]
*  economic value and economic rent to the society. But you got to check people that speak cruelty [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5882.64s)]
*  to other people. Can't do it. Sorry, man. Understood. And I'll speak out against it [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5889.360000000001s)]
*  for the rest of my life because I'm a family of immigrants. They told my grandmother to go back [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5894.0s)]
*  to the country she came from. Okay. And you can't have the president of the United States talking [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5899.76s)]
*  like that. Sorry. Without somebody calling him out on it and saying, hey, asshole, cut it out. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5904.0s)]
*  Yeah. It doesn't help the discourse in this country. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5909.839999999999s)]
*  Respect is important across the board, especially from our leaders. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5911.92s)]
*  All right. Respectful dialogue. Salim, you were going to say something. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5916.799999999999s)]
*  All right. If we're talking about amendments and constitutional stuff, [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5919.92s)]
*  I would go after the second amendment as well just to tweak it a bit, but we don't have to [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5923.839999999999s)]
*  touch on that. That will light a good fire. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5928.719999999999s)]
*  We're neither. We're not. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5931.44s)]
*  We're not. We're not. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5932.32s)]
*  We are our co-secretaries of the constitution. Okay. We're going to tweak it up. We're going [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5933.12s)]
*  to get it refreshed for the next great American century, which makes the system fairer, more plural, [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5937.6s)]
*  and protects people from tyranny. That's exactly what our founders wanted to do. That's the reason [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5945.6s)]
*  why we're so prosperous. Let's tweak it up again and to prevent an oligarchy. We don't want an [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5950.8s)]
*  oligarchy. I want must be worth three, four trillion dollars, but I want there to be a very [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5957.04s)]
*  deep, very broad, middle and positive growing aspirational middle class. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5963.36s)]
*  Roaring 20s, buddy. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5971.599999999999s)]
*  One thing that I'm incredibly encouraged by just in the world is that if you went back a couple [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5972.719999999999s)]
*  of hundred years ago, the richest people in the world exclusively had inherited their wealth, [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5977.44s)]
*  and today the richest people in the world have actually created their wealth. I think that's [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5982.16s)]
*  incredibly full-blown. I mean, a lot of that has to do with the American model. It's been exported [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5985.759999999999s)]
*  to India and the UK and Europe, but the Americans really came up with that, right? Andrew Carnegie [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5989.92s)]
*  came here penniless. The Rockefellers. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5995.12s)]
*  It's amazing. One of my venture funds, Exponential Ventures, it's an AI fund investing in MIT and [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=5998.0s)]
*  Harvard teams. We have two companies founded by effectively 21-year-olds that have gone from [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6004.72s)]
*  zero to two billion dollar valuations in under two years. The ability to create wealth today [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6012.24s)]
*  is insane, and I think it's just beginning. Now, the good news is when that wealth is created, [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6019.5199999999995s)]
*  you know, Facebook and Google and OpenAI have created not just a couple of billionaires at the [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6027.04s)]
*  top, but hundreds and thousands of centimillionaires below them that then go and invest in the next [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6035.36s)]
*  generation. And there's this engine, right? I just got back from India. I was in India, [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6041.92s)]
*  four cities over the course of two months, and the problem is that that doesn't occur there [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6046.56s)]
*  yet. If you've got a great idea, you leave the country, you go and build the United States, [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6051.76s)]
*  and the wealth is not being created that is flowing to a large percentage of the entrepreneurs who [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6056.24s)]
*  then reinvest. And so we need to preserve this special sauce that we have here. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6061.84s)]
*  And I think that we can. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6068.4s)]
*  Well, and spread it. And spread it. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6069.2s)]
*  Because as you can spread some of these ideas to places like India, [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6070.5599999999995s)]
*  it'll completely change the game there. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6074.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6075.76s)]
*  I love it. I love it. Remember something. Your freedom of press, the First Amendment, [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6076.24s)]
*  Secretary of the Constitution, drives the economic innovation. Do never forget that. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6082.639999999999s)]
*  Because we teach our second graders to speak and think freely. They create the XPRIZE. They [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6088.24s)]
*  create Singularity University, Google, Facebook. They develop Bitcoin here in the United States. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6094.96s)]
*  And remember that. If you teach your second graders they can't talk about dear leader, [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6101.36s)]
*  and they got to go into a re-education camp if they do, they don't innovate. They have to steal [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6107.84s)]
*  our intellectual property. So these sacred ideas that have been in these texts for hundreds of [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6114.4s)]
*  years are there for a reason. That is one of the fountains of our innovation and our creativity [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6121.12s)]
*  is the free press. Don't go after the free press. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6127.28s)]
*  Amen. But the last thing I'll say is media in the United States is changing dramatically. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6130.96s)]
*  The old news networks are vaporizing and slowly dematerializing on their own. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6138.96s)]
*  I mean, this was a podcast election, I would say, for the first time ever. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6144.16s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. But they lost the plot, the media. Look, by the way, I don't agree with what the [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6147.92s)]
*  media is doing, the hard right or the hard left or the nonsense. And so what happened? [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6153.36s)]
*  Great innovation happened. Joe Rogan comes on, I don't know, hundreds of millions of downloads, [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6159.2s)]
*  and people think of Joe as a fair arbiter of trying to get to the truth. Bobby Kennedy has [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6165.76s)]
*  a podcast talking about the Uberman has a podcast. You two guys have a podcast. Okay. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6171.36s)]
*  I'm inspired by your podcast. When I listen to your podcast, things are going to be okay. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6178.08s)]
*  And I will confess to both of you that I have stolen, and by the way, I don't give either of [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6182.88s)]
*  you two credit for anything. I steal the entire thing for plagiarizing, okay, elements of what [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6188.5599999999995s)]
*  you guys talk about in terms of exponential abundance and to get people off of thinking [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6194.08s)]
*  linearly while the world is happening around them exponentially. I listen to you guys, [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6199.92s)]
*  and I import and incorporate what you guys are saying. And that's not legacy media. That's a new [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6205.04s)]
*  media. I think this is a perfect- So the media blows. So now we've got people like you coming in [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6212.16s)]
*  to innovate, and they're going to be forced to change. Yeah, if they still exist. So- [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6219.84s)]
*  But let's have the free press though. They want to act like assholes on the left or assholes on the [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6226.639999999999s)]
*  right. Who cares? New media will come in and knock those guys out. Yeah. I mean, what I love about [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6231.36s)]
*  X, I still call it Twitter, but what I love about X is the fact that anyone can post [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6238.0s)]
*  and that I'm not beholden to some editor who's telling me what they think should be posted. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6245.76s)]
*  I can see it all. I can follow Scaramucci here. I can follow Salim. Listen, this has been a fun [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6252.8s)]
*  conversation. We still have a lot more to talk about. So let's do this trio again. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6260.400000000001s)]

*  saying. And God bless him for coming up with it and saying it and helping it along. So Mooch, [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6284.08s)]

*  podcast on politics. I do it with a woman named Cady K. She's a British journalist. It's called [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6334.72s)]
*  The Rest is Politics U.S. And it's a fun podcast because- Because you're involved. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6340.88s)]

*  from him because I know exactly how he thinks. You know, Vance called him Hitler. Bobby Kennedy [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6372.24s)]
*  had bad things to say, but everyone gets- Everyone goes in and out of Trump world. You know, he changes [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6378.0s)]

*  He's not going to do that. Trust me. I guarantee that he won't do that. I'm going to start a betting pool. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6387.12s)]
*  I'm going to start a betting pool. But I guarantee there'll be peace in the kingdom because, [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR_YEdgWWrw&t=6391.92s)]
