# Building The World's Most Powerful Satellites w/ Will Marshall | EP #90
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [March 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk)
*  Information is power, data is the new oil. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=0.0s)]
*  It's the thing that's going to power all the industry. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  We're building a system that makes humanity able to smartly manage resources, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=5.24s)]
*  a bit like the eye system with the visual cortex helps humans make smart decisions. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=13.84s)]
*  It's awe-inspiring and it's important for people to understand what's coming. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  So I think of it as awareness to action. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=23.04s)]
*  That's the phase change that we're going from. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=25.44s)]
*  And action requires detailed tools and information that's timely and relevant to your day-to-day life. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=27.8s)]
*  And just like the mainframe computer, the desktop revolution, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  it's going to change the whole dynamics of what's possible in space. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=36.64s)]
*  And this is just the beginning. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=40.2s)]
*  Everybody, Peter here. Welcome to Moonshots. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=43.16s)]
*  I'm here with a dear friend. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=45.24s)]
*  May I say an old dear friend? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=48.24s)]
*  We've been friends for over a couple of decades. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  Dr. Will Marshall. Will, good to see you, buddy. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=54.24s)]
*  Grades of beyond. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=57.0s)]
*  Yeah, no. So listen, you've got a massive moonshot. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=58.2s)]
*  And it really, when I think of you, I think about raster scanning the planet. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=62.6s)]
*  It's about being able to know anything I want, any time I want, anywhere I want, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=67.2s)]
*  and really understanding the vibrancy, the problems, the opportunities globally. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=71.6s)]
*  So let's begin with a quick overview of what is Planet Labs. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=79.2s)]
*  And then I want to get into what is your 10, 20, 30-year vision for Planet Labs, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=86.52s)]
*  because it's audacious and it truly is a moonshot. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=90.52s)]
*  Yeah, well, certainly. Look, Planet in short is a company. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=93.44s)]
*  We have 200 satellites that image the entire landmass of the Earth every day. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=97.56s)]
*  So it's a bit like if you go into Google and click on the satellite imagery layer, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=104.08s)]
*  except that image is typically a few years old. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=108.96s)]
*  We've got today and yesterday and the day before and the day before and the day before, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  basically 2,500 images now on average for every point of the landmass of the Earth, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=118.60000000000001s)]
*  documenting immense change going on and powering AI tools to sit on top [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=125.04s)]
*  that enable us to take smarter care of the planet, resources upon it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=130.08s)]
*  But in many ways, we started as a space company. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=138.08s)]
*  Now we're a data company. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=142.16s)]
*  And that's the cool thing that's going on now. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=143.6s)]
*  Space companies, it's less about the rockets and the satellites [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  and more and more about the data and how it can totally transform the Earth economy. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=149.16s)]
*  And that's the sort of exciting phase. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=153.68s)]
*  And I guess, you know, as a public company now, the company's name is Planet. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=156.4s)]
*  It used to be Planet Labs back in the early days. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=160.28s)]
*  So I'll refer to it as Planet. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=162.68s)]
*  And it's amazing. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=164.76s)]
*  We're going to talk about the stories of how you went from literally a phone satellite [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=166.67999999999998s)]
*  to now 200 satellites, I think the largest private imaging collection of satellites. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=172.67999999999998s)]
*  Maybe the NRO has more. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=179.67999999999998s)]
*  I don't know, maybe they use yours. Who knows? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=181.48s)]
*  You've got more than the NRO and more than the governments. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=183.56s)]
*  Yeah, amazing. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=186.6s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=189.2s)]
*  And an incredible journey. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=190.92s)]
*  Buying satellites from Google, getting Eric Schmidt and Larry Page and Sergey Brin, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=193.4s)]
*  the entire group there, and Steve Jervitsyn, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=199.4s)]
*  one of the most incredible venture capitalists in the field, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=201.92s)]
*  to back you as a 20-something-year-old. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  So I want to tell all that story. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=207.0s)]
*  And it really, the ups, the downs, and the audacity of the moonshot, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  you not only planned, but built. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=214.35999999999999s)]
*  But I want to go someplace else first, because I've heard you describe this, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=217.6s)]
*  and it's awe-inspiring, and it's important for people to understand what's coming. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=221.64s)]
*  What is 10 years from now, 20 years from now, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=227.12s)]
*  what's your vision of what planet is doing, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=232.24s)]
*  and what's possible for humanity with the tech that you're building? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=236.16s)]
*  Well, look, it's a big question, but I really think that we have the tools [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=241.04s)]
*  at our disposal now to manage the planet in a very different way. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=247.16s)]
*  We've got a lot of challenges, the climate change, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=252.88s)]
*  and we can talk about biodiversity loss and all these things. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=255.16s)]
*  But more broadly, we're on a spaceship hurtling around the sun, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=258.84000000000003s)]
*  and we were taking data of it once a month, once a year. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=263.6s)]
*  And how the heck are you managing that? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=268.32s)]
*  It's a bit like, you know, I think we were having a conversation with our grandchildren, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=270.72s)]
*  like, then they'll say, hey, how did you manage the planet before you measured it regularly? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=276.44s)]
*  Of course, the answer was not very well, you know? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=281.08s)]
*  And you obviously can't be a smart actor without data. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=284.68s)]
*  I mean, as a space geek, I'll tell you a little space story, you know, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=289.72s)]
*  that when you put satellites into space, you obviously try to measure them faster [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=293.72s)]
*  than the time scale they change. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=297.96s)]
*  Like, if they're spinning around once a minute, you better measure that spin [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=299.48s)]
*  faster than once a minute. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=303.88s)]
*  Like, if you take a data point once a minute, you ain't going to stop the spin, right? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=305.0s)]
*  You need to measure it faster. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=308.6s)]
*  We are all on a spaceship, eight billion astronauts hurtling around the sun. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=310.84s)]
*  And, you know, we have an impact on that planet on days and weeks time scale of human activity. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=315.88s)]
*  How do we manage that if we're not taking information, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=322.76s)]
*  if we're not taking data points on that sort of time scale? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=326.28s)]
*  So it stands to reason that you can't help the planet without that sort of data. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=328.52s)]
*  As they like to say, you can't manage what you don't measure. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=334.92s)]
*  So the vision in many ways is to give everyone the tools [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=337.64s)]
*  that our neighbors ask to make smart day-to-day decisions [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=341.4s)]
*  based on the physical understanding of what's going on on the planet. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=345.08s)]
*  I actually did a TED talk which extended it just beyond just the imagery of the Earth. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=348.44s)]
*  It's the AI on top that then enables you to sort of have a query with Earth. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=355.48s)]
*  This is in 2018. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=359.88s)]
*  And, you know, in modern parlance, it'll be like Planet GPT, you know? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=362.68s)]
*  What is it that you should just be like you can a text, search the internet and text now [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=367.56s)]
*  in human readable form if you're like, what's going on? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=376.20000000000005s)]
*  And it gives you human readable answers. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=378.76s)]
*  You should be able to do that for the Earth. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=381.16s)]
*  How many trees are there being cut down on the Amazon? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=382.84s)]
*  Where are those trees? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=387.71999999999997s)]
*  What's the plot versus time? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=388.84s)]
*  What's happening in my neighborhood? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=390.91999999999996s)]
*  Who's doing what? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=392.44s)]
*  How are the parks doing? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=395.15999999999997s)]
*  How do they need help? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=396.35999999999996s)]
*  What do we need to do to clear up the pollution? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=397.88s)]
*  Why is it? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=400.12s)]
*  Where's the pollution come from? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=400.59999999999997s)]
*  All these challenges. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=402.52s)]
*  Humans should be able to have that at their fingertips [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=405.15999999999997s)]
*  and without having to have a PhD in space satellite imagery processing in order to get that, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=407.16s)]
*  right? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=413.8s)]
*  Just like we are doing again. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=414.28000000000003s)]
*  AI companies have figured out how to turn the text of the internet first into a searchable place. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=417.8s)]
*  That was Google. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=423.96000000000004s)]
*  And now into this human readable way of interacting. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=424.84000000000003s)]
*  I love Planet GPT. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=429.48s)]
*  It's a fantastic term. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=430.84000000000003s)]
*  You should put that out there more. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=434.36s)]
*  So I love the idea that at any time you can query what's going on on the surface of the Earth [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=435.56s)]
*  and get an answer and do it at a variety of spectral information and resolutions. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=445.16s)]
*  So you have 200 satellites today, roughly. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=454.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=458.2s)]
*  With it? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=458.92s)]
*  If you're setting your moonshot entrepreneur a decade from now or two decades from now, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=460.38s)]
*  what do you imagine to create Planet GPT where you've got information at a regular basis [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=469.58000000000004s)]
*  at high resolution? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=477.26s)]
*  What do you want to get to? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=480.46000000000004s)]
*  What's your vision? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=482.06s)]
*  Well, on the data side, I think we're going to, and the satellite piece, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=483.02000000000004s)]
*  we're going to get more and more accurate data. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=486.06s)]
*  So higher resolution, smaller pixels. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=488.22s)]
*  What's the resolution today? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=491.74s)]
*  Well, our daily scan is at three meter resolution. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=493.58000000000004s)]
*  Our highest resolution imagery is at 50 centimeters. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=496.06s)]
*  So we have a fleet of 20 satellites that can zoom in anywhere. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=498.54s)]
*  And actually, it's kind of fun to think of it like how the human eye works, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=501.98s)]
*  which is you have peripheral vision in much of your visual field. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=505.18s)]
*  You only have high resolution in a tiny bit in the center. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=509.58000000000004s)]
*  And actually, it's black and white beyond a certain point in your peripheral. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=514.62s)]
*  But you're very good at change detection. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=519.02s)]
*  And if there's something changes, your visual cortex goes, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=520.7s)]
*  hey, guys, get that high res over here. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=522.94s)]
*  And then you can see your eyes or your head. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=525.5s)]
*  So we have the scan, which looks at the whole peripheral at three meter resolution, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=527.5s)]
*  the whole planet. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=532.46s)]
*  And then we have the high res that can zoom in on any particular piece that changes. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=533.34s)]
*  So we call that system fovea, a bit like the inspired by the eye. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=536.78s)]
*  And the visual cortex is, of course, the AI that looks at the scan, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=541.02s)]
*  finds the changes, finds what's interesting in the changes. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=545.1800000000001s)]
*  Blocks out everything else and then coordinates what we should do as a result of that, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=548.3000000000001s)]
*  including taking high resolution imagery, but also making decisions day to day. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=551.82s)]
*  Oh, that's a threat. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=555.74s)]
*  This is just a cloud. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=556.5400000000001s)]
*  No big deal. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=558.46s)]
*  And so think of it that way. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=560.5400000000001s)]
*  I think we're building a system that makes humanity able to smartly manage resources, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=562.46s)]
*  a bit like the eye system with the visual cortex helps humans make smart decisions. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=569.5s)]
*  Do you remember calling me during COVID one night, really excited? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=574.7s)]
*  I think I just had a power outage in the home. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=579.18s)]
*  And you're on the phone giving me your vision of where, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=581.5s)]
*  I guess now calling it Planet GPT, where it was going. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=586.0600000000001s)]
*  And I was just, it was the most compelling vision I've heard about both giving our children the [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=591.02s)]
*  tools to manage the planet. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=599.82s)]
*  But it's also a multi-trillion dollar business opportunity. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=601.82s)]
*  Can you dive in a little bit more? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=605.98s)]
*  So do you think we'll have thousands of satellites? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=607.74s)]
*  Do you think we'll have higher resolution? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=609.9000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think it will get more and more real time and higher resolution. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=612.1400000000001s)]
*  So maybe, you know, we'll definitely get sub-meter daily scan, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=616.0600000000001s)]
*  but I think we'll get more like hourly, maybe less. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=619.98s)]
*  We'll also have other spectral bands. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=626.3000000000001s)]
*  So we talk about going up in spatial resolution, temporal resolution, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=627.98s)]
*  so how frequently, and spectral resolution, how many spectral bands, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=631.02s)]
*  and that is less usual for the human eye, but it's an absolute field day for the algorithms, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=634.46s)]
*  because they can use different colors to distinguish between things. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=640.46s)]
*  I mean, even down to, I mean, we're just about to launch some hyperspectral satellites that have [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=643.66s)]
*  400 spectral bands that enable us, literally, you can tell not just that it's a green car, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=647.1s)]
*  it's a green car that comes from this factory over here, because that's the only factory that [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=653.4200000000001s)]
*  produces that shade of green, you know? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=657.1s)]
*  You can also look at what the oil reserves are of a country by virtue of the thermal [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=660.78s)]
*  heating of the oil tanks, because... [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=666.38s)]
*  Well, you said the levels of the tanks, we can even do that today. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=669.26s)]
*  I mean, but even like, I mean, one of the most wicked problems of the earth is, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=672.7s)]
*  where's all the life, what different forms are where? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=676.46s)]
*  We can actually tell species type of the trees or the grasses or the corals underneath the [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=679.02s)]
*  sea down to a certain depth and so on, all automatically. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=686.94s)]
*  And so this is a field day, as I said, for AI, because it can pull out all of these things, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=691.1s)]
*  right? And help us understand, again, the planet. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=697.98s)]
*  So it's, we're both Trekkies. And so when the Starship Enterprise, you know, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=700.7s)]
*  sort of goes into orbit around the planet and Captain Kirk tells Spock to scan the planet, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=704.7s)]
*  and he says, we got these many life forms here. I mean, that's basically what you're enabling. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=712.22s)]
*  Totally. Totally. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=716.3000000000001s)]
*  I mean, talk about the idea of what industries and businesses this enables. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=718.22s)]
*  So can I just paint the picture one second? So thousands of satellites, yes? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=725.9s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's right. Yeah. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=732.22s)]
*  Thousands of satellites with each satellite has how many sensors on it? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=734.14s)]
*  Yeah, a few. I mean, it doesn't need to be many. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=739.58s)]
*  I mean, it's mainly through one telescope, but different spectral regions. Yeah. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=742.3000000000001s)]
*  And all of this is being fed into a data layer that's being able to, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=746.3000000000001s)]
*  is constantly being analyzed by AI. Yep. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=753.1s)]
*  Right. I mean, so this is about early detection of disasters. It's about [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=755.9s)]
*  early detection of opportunities. It's about discovery. It's science. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=761.58s)]
*  It's definitely industry. It's hedge funds, managing hedge funds. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=766.3000000000001s)]
*  It's everything. I mean- [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=771.26s)]
*  Go give me an understanding of how big this opportunity is, and how does it change [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=772.86s)]
*  the way we do business today? Because it's massive. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=779.74s)]
*  Well, I mean, information is power. I mean, the economist said data is the new oil. It's the [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=782.38s)]
*  thing that's going to power all the industries. By the way, a little fun fact, if you look at all [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=787.34s)]
*  the tech giants and what they're doing with AI, they're all open sourcing the AI code. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=793.1s)]
*  They're all open sourcing exactly zero of the data, because the asset that they have that's unique [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=797.98s)]
*  is always the data, not the algorithms, or less the algorithms than the data. And that's why, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=804.0600000000001s)]
*  so when you think of AI, where to invest in an AI company, who's got the interesting data? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=809.1s)]
*  Because that's going to be where you feel- So data is the new oil. It powers all the industries. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=815.1s)]
*  Hopefully it's not dirty like oil, but it is analogous in the sense that it powers all these [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=819.5s)]
*  different industries. Oil powers all these different industries. Data is going to power [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=824.78s)]
*  all those industries as well. If you're in transportation, it's going to make more efficient [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=828.3s)]
*  transportation. If you're in agriculture, it's going to make more efficient agriculture. If [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=831.66s)]
*  you're in government, it's going to make more efficient government. If you're in, you know, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=834.4599999999999s)]
*  you just race across all the things. Yes, hedge funds, insurance, you know, and I can get more [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=837.74s)]
*  concrete. Let me give you a couple of specific examples. I think of the world as, you know, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=842.6999999999999s)]
*  broadly undergoing three transformations today. One is digital transformation. That's the [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=847.42s)]
*  transition of industries to help them digitize, bring their systems into the information world [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=853.58s)]
*  such that they can then be more efficient. The second is sustainability. And we've got [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=861.74s)]
*  to transition to have a sustainable economy that doesn't blow up the boundaries of the planet. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=866.94s)]
*  It obviously does so in a way that we don't further heat the planet and so on. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=872.38s)]
*  And the third is we've got to do all of that with having good peace and security, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=876.62s)]
*  geopolitically. And what we need for all three of those factors is transparency and accountability [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=880.78s)]
*  of what goes on. So everyone needs to know and understand their supply chains for supply chain [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=888.78s)]
*  risk, for security, for sustainability. But let me get a little bit more concrete. Digital [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=892.9399999999999s)]
*  transformation, take agriculture. We image every farmer's field on the earth every day. That's [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=902.62s)]
*  roughly a quarter of the landmass of the planet is agricultural land. Every single farmer's field, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=908.86s)]
*  we can tell in each three by three box, what crop is it? Is it corn, wheat, soil? How well is it [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=913.82s)]
*  doing? What practices the farmer used? And what they should do next, whether they should add water, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=920.38s)]
*  the soil is too dry, we can actually tell the soil moisture level. Is the crop in need of [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=927.82s)]
*  fertilizer, herbicide or not? Is they putting too much so that it's causing runoff that you could [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=933.1800000000001s)]
*  then save? In total, we think that we can improve crop yields by at least 20% and decrease use of [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=937.98s)]
*  fertilizer and other things and other inputs by 20% as well. A 40% increase to efficiency of a [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=944.94s)]
*  trillion-dollar sector, that's a big deal. I could go through industry-led industry on digital [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=951.1s)]
*  transformation. Then there's sustainability transformation. Here, we need to help ourselves [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=956.94s)]
*  to manage the planet. I'll give you an example from just last year. Brazil, we do a weekly image [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=964.62s)]
*  of a scan for new road starts in the Brazilian Amazon, the whole Brazilian Amazon once per week. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=973.02s)]
*  And if we find a new road, it's a sign of early sign of either illegal deforestation, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=980.3s)]
*  because they put in these logging roads before they then get a treat, or illegal narcotics, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=985.5s)]
*  or illegal mining. We provide these weekly alerts to the federal police in Brazil. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=990.62s)]
*  They sent last year 3,000 expeditions based on our alerts, and they own total reduced deforestation [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1001.98s)]
*  in Brazil by 55% in one year on the back of this system. And they confiscated $2 billion worth of [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1011.9s)]
*  assets. I hope you got a commission on that. Well, we kind of did. Yeah, that was hard sale. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1020.46s)]
*  It wasn't actually done like that, but there's great ROI. That's sustainability transformation. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1026.8600000000001s)]
*  And then peace and security is where we help countries like what's happening in Ukraine right [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1033.9s)]
*  now. We did a building damage assessment across all of Ukraine, helping everyone to understand [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1038.7s)]
*  what's it going to cost to rebuild. We did an assessment of where the crops and how well the [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1043.74s)]
*  crops are doing for food security for that country and also for the world, because it's a [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1047.42s)]
*  bread basket for the world. We did an assessment of how the Russians are stealing grain, where [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1050.78s)]
*  they're taking it to. There's all this stuff that we can help operationally and in certain broader [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1054.94s)]
*  humanitarian sense. And finally, also in terms of hearts and minds, every time Russia says, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1060.54s)]
*  oh, we don't bomb civilian targets, we have shared with the New York Times where they bomb [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1067.26s)]
*  civilian targets, the schools and the hospitals. It's accountability that we can share this, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1072.06s)]
*  because it's not a classified system owned by the NRO. We can share that data with news media where [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1079.02s)]
*  it's appropriate to shed light on what's going on and hold those actors accountable. This is [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1085.58s)]
*  transparency equals accountability. And so these are the three major areas we can help on a couple [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1091.26s)]
*  of specific. I love that. I speak about the fact that people behave differently when they're being [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1096.78s)]
*  watched. That you put a camera in front of the dictator and the dictator changes their behavior. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1102.62s)]
*  You put drones over poachers going after an ospreys and the poachers go away. And so this is [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1110.22s)]
*  complete and total transparency and forced accountability. I remember you speaking about [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1117.66s)]
*  a vision of the future of like brand new layers of Googleable data or [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1124.38s)]
*  Geminiable or chat GPTable data where a school kid can literally [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1132.54s)]
*  go and discover whatever they want. Can you speak a little bit about that information layer on top [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1143.82s)]
*  of the planet and what that means? I think that's right. The way I broadly think about it, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1150.86s)]
*  actually, and you've taken it more into the consciousness realm, when humans went to the [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1156.1399999999999s)]
*  moon and looked back and saw the earth, we helped up level human spirit to say, hey, we're on a [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1160.62s)]
*  planet. It's fragile. It made to a phase change in human consciousness, the thin layer of atmosphere [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1169.58s)]
*  protecting us from the vacuum of space, the coldness of space. It was daunting, but it helped [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1175.42s)]
*  give birth to the green movement. I think we're on the verge of living. We've got a big mirror [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1181.98s)]
*  to look at ourselves in the face. That webcam is more of a mirror and back to ourselves. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1188.8600000000001s)]
*  And with that, we're already aware that we're on a planet, that now it's enabling us to take [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1195.3400000000001s)]
*  smarter action because everyone can see everything. I think of it as awareness to action. That's the [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1203.74s)]
*  phase change that we're going from. Action requires detailed tools and information that's [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1210.54s)]
*  timely and relevant to your day-to-day life. Anyway, going to your journey for a child, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1217.26s)]
*  look, think about the exploration that can be done on this planet. I love sci-fi like you do. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1225.02s)]
*  You're talking about Star Trek, but sci reality is fucking amazing. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1229.3400000000001s)]
*  I barely get time for sci-fi because there's so many sci-facts that I just get boggled by. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1238.46s)]
*  The earth is full of those. You look around the planet, it's constantly changing. I look at our [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1243.74s)]
*  imagery every day and you see rivers changing. You see people harvest things. You see boats move. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1248.1399999999999s)]
*  You see all this stuff happening. The earth is dynamic. We have this false impression. The earth [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1254.86s)]
*  is a static place because we were used to maths, whether it's online or physical. That's not how [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1259.9s)]
*  the world works. The earth is dynamic. What an exploration. Go pile in. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1266.22s)]
*  Everyone, it's Peter. In a few weeks, I'm gathering an incredible group of AI leaders, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1272.6200000000001s)]
*  including Ray Kurzweil, Eric Schmidt, Mustafa Saliman, Imaad Mustaq, Michael Seller and others [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1277.9s)]
*  at my private Abundance Summit to discuss the impact of AI on our lives, our businesses, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1284.14s)]
*  and the world. The Abundance Summit is a private community open to extraordinary [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1289.58s)]
*  moonshot entrepreneurs. It's Singularity University's highest level program, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1294.38s)]
*  and it's not for everyone. If you're at the top of your game and you want to learn more [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1298.8600000000001s)]
*  about this program, click on the link below to be considered. Okay, let's go back to the episode. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1303.2600000000002s)]
*  Enjoy. For everybody listening, Will is an extraordinary moonshot entrepreneur, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1308.94s)]
*  an exponential entrepreneur, and we met each other in the space community. God, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1314.8600000000001s)]
*  what were the SpaceGen conferences? I think we met in 1999 in that Vienna conference, and then [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1321.42s)]
*  2000, 2001, 2002. I don't know. We definitely met in, I think 1999 was when we met. 25 years ago. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1328.86s)]
*  Yeah, that's good. Pretty ancient at this time. I don't know. I still feel like a kid. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1335.26s)]
*  You're still playing with toys, but they're world-changing toys. I want to dive into the [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1341.34s)]
*  journey. I keep on reminding people that these moonshots that entrepreneurs are taking [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1347.18s)]
*  are not overnight successes. They're typically overnight successes after 10, 11 years of hard [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1354.54s)]
*  work. Exactly. I want to go back to your story. I'd like you to share the story, the ups and the [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1360.0600000000002s)]
*  downs, and those pivotal moments, and just to put some numbers on it. Planet was founded circa [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1368.38s)]
*  2010, I think, and then you went public in 2021. You can go and find Planet. Planet's on the top [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1376.78s)]
*  of my ticker list on my phone. You can go find Planet on the NASDAQ, and it's now 2024. It's been [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1384.94s)]
*  a 14-year journey from startup to today, and amazing what you've built. Let's go back. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1394.7s)]
*  You and I met each other again back on the campus of NASA Ames at Singularity University. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1402.3s)]
*  What was that formative moment like for you and your co-founders? [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1411.42s)]
*  Yeah. Look, the thing that had happened was that my colleague at NASA had kept on holding up his [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1415.02s)]
*  phone. This is the early smartphone in 2000. Was it a Google phone? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1422.14s)]
*  I don't know. In his specific case, I don't know. He would say, look, this has got most of what a [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1430.22s)]
*  satellite has. If you think about what's in a phone, it's got cameras, it's got GPS, it's got [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1436.22s)]
*  rate gyros, it's got accelerometers, it's got processors, radios. I mean, it's just crazy, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1441.34s)]
*  all the stuff. It's stuffed in here, and it costs 500 bucks or 1,000 bucks. Meanwhile, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1447.34s)]
*  NASA is building these huge satellites. They also have roughly the same list of things, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1452.8600000000001s)]
*  but they cost 500 million bucks or a billion bucks. The quick thing, we were like, what are [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1457.5s)]
*  those extra six zeros brewing for us? I'm not saying they're nothing. No one was saying it's [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1463.9s)]
*  nothing. It's lower risk. It's a bigger telescope. It's a better sensor, but it's kind of remarkable [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1471.74s)]
*  how much stuff is put into this little box. We wanted to leverage that. NASA was very much in [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1479.98s)]
*  the mindset of inventing everything for itself because you know what? It had to. Send a man to [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1485.98s)]
*  the moon. Well, we didn't have computers, so we had to invent micro computers. We didn't have [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1490.78s)]
*  solar panels, so we invent solar panels. All that, we have to build everything from scratch. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1494.78s)]
*  Well, guess what? The top R&D dollars aren't in NASA anymore. They're at Google, Samsung, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1499.42s)]
*  Apple, Microsoft, all the rest. This is learning to follow for the space industry, not a comfortable [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1505.66s)]
*  place for the space industry. We're used to leading from the front. We were a little bit [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1512.7s)]
*  annoyed by this old idea of having to follow, but the fact is that the billions of dollars that have [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1519.02s)]
*  gone into miniaturization of electronics were super useful for space. This is learning to take [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1523.18s)]
*  those, stuff them into much smaller satellites, much lower costs, but have much higher cost [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1527.98s)]
*  performance. That is data per unit dollar. We estimate that that has changed orders of magnitude [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1534.6200000000001s)]
*  because of ours and others' efforts. I mean, at least three orders of magnitude. That is a bit [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1542.06s)]
*  like the mainframe computer to desktop computer revolution, but for space. Just like the mainframe [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1546.7s)]
*  computer to desktop revolution, it's going to change the whole dynamics of what's possible in [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1553.74s)]
*  space. This is just the beginning between communication satellites and Earth imaging satellites [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1558.54s)]
*  take off, but there's going to be others as well. Better GPS navigation systems, you're going to see [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1562.22s)]
*  better radar systems, but so many things are going to take off because of the fact that you've got [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1568.3s)]
*  much more capability per dollar. Also, launch costs have come down about 4x in the same period. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1575.98s)]
*  So that has helped as well. Although a common misconception, I think, is that that's the [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1582.3s)]
*  dominant thing that's led to this. Actually, it's kind of the other way around. Satellites, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1586.7s)]
*  miniaturizing has enabled us to put much more capability per kilogram that's going up. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1591.66s)]
*  That has changed the demand for going up, which enabled us to bring the cost down. I would say [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1597.3400000000001s)]
*  it's much more that way around than the other way around. We still benefit, and they add on to one [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1602.0600000000002s)]
*  another. But the thousand X in the space industry, this happened, is not to do with the launch. It's [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1607.02s)]
*  to do with the miniaturization and increasing capabilities performance of satellites. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1613.5s)]
*  Per unit dollar, per unit kilogram. Yeah. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1618.14s)]
*  Exactly. The specific performance of satellites has gone through the roof. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1620.3s)]
*  That phase change enables lots of different applications, and most of them are in the field [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1625.66s)]
*  of some sort of data because you're remote. It's all about collecting data or transmitting data. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1630.06s)]
*  Just in the last five years, we've seen more than a tenfold increase in amount of data from space [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1634.86s)]
*  and more than a tenfold increase in the amount of data around orbit because with communication [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1640.54s)]
*  satellites enabling communication on one side of the planet and the other. That's a total revolution [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1645.5s)]
*  that. 10 X in both of those areas. The upshot of the space revolution is a data revolution. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1649.5s)]
*  There was that moment. Was it Robbie who was your co-founder at that time? [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1657.02s)]
*  Robbie Atchityris Boschhausen. Yeah. Both great, amazing. How old were you guys when you were- [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1660.3s)]
*  So we were late 20s when we started that. We were like, okay, so phones, they work. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1667.1s)]
*  Let's put them in a vacuum. Let's stick them on the side of a rocket. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1674.06s)]
*  I remember that conversation. I remember you were saying we stick this thing in the vacuum [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1677.02s)]
*  chamber and see if it still works afterwards. Yeah, we did. It was funny because that's like [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1680.78s)]
*  going back to the womb for these guys because actually all the electronics are made in a vacuum. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1685.74s)]
*  That's what people don't appreciate. They're made like brick shithouses, these things. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1691.82s)]
*  You can drop them. They still work. They fall out of airplanes. They land. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1697.5s)]
*  They're still working. They're robust. We stuck it on the side of a rocket. It also still works. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1700.78s)]
*  We eventually put three into orbit. I almost got fired by Pete Wardham because I hadn't really got [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1706.3799999999999s)]
*  all the things in a row to do that. I remember that. I didn't know that we were doing this and [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1714.06s)]
*  kind of freaked out when they found out. But we were like, no, this is going to be cool. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1721.1s)]
*  We're going to show that consumer electronics can work in space and that can change the whole [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1725.74s)]
*  whole cost equation here. So yeah, we launched three phones into space. They worked. They were [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1730.78s)]
*  tumbling around. So I want you to back up a second here. So you have the idea. You and Robbie and [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1735.82s)]
*  Chris start, was it Planet Labs at the beginning? Yeah. Well, no, this phone project was at NASA. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1741.82s)]
*  This was an internal NASA project. Internal NASA project. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1748.3s)]
*  Government funding just to see. And by the way- [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1750.86s)]
*  Not much, but I'm not funding. Yeah. Stolen work hours, if you would, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1753.5s)]
*  nights and weekends. And so you send up three and it works. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1758.7s)]
*  They work. And then- They're tumbling around, taking pictures. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1763.74s)]
*  People with Yagi antennas all around the world picking up the packets because we don't have [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1768.14s)]
*  ground stations. They send us the packets. We reconfig these pictures and we're like, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1771.5800000000002s)]
*  okay, we take pictures from space for a few thousand dollars, not a few [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1775.26s)]
*  bazillion dollars. So okay, this is kind of interesting. Maybe we should leave NASA and [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1778.7s)]
*  do something like this. I mean, the cameras on this wasn't the right kind of images. It was more [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1784.78s)]
*  proof of principle. It's a proof of principle that this technology could work in space. So then, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1788.94s)]
*  yeah, we left NASA to start Planet. Actually, it's initially called Cosmogia. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1793.5s)]
*  That's right. A few years in. And we launched then- [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1797.8999999999999s)]
*  So where'd you go first? Was Steve your first investor then? [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1805.02s)]
*  Yeah. So he was. We started building and launching our first satellite. We put the [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1809.1s)]
*  deposit down on a rocket with our own pocket money. Which rocket was that? [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1814.9399999999998s)]
*  There was an Antares rocket. And we actually put them- [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1819.34s)]
*  Antares. Okay. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1821.6599999999999s)]
*  One on Antares, one on a Soyuz. Wouldn't be popular these days. We're not meant to use [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1822.78s)]
*  the Russians. But then we could and we did. And so we put the deposit down, but there was no way [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1827.1s)]
*  we were going to afford the main cost of the launch. And so we were like, oh shit, we need to [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1833.74s)]
*  get some money. That was when I was reminded, because one of the times we were launching one [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1837.5s)]
*  of these phone sats, it was in the Nevada Black Rock Desert, right in the way of Burning Man. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1842.38s)]
*  And when there's not Burning Man, there's sometimes amateur rocketeers go up there and launch things [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1847.5s)]
*  into space because there's a very high- Airspace. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1853.02s)]
*  Airspace. Yeah. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1858.62s)]
*  Airspace. So they can do that. And of course, there's no one around. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1859.34s)]
*  And so we were up there and Steve was helping us to put our rocket together or something. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1862.46s)]
*  I didn't know who he was, but he blogged about what we did the next day. And that was when [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1870.7s)]
*  Pete found out about our phone set project and almost fired me because he was like, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1876.7s)]
*  I just read you guys are putting phones in space. And we were like, okay, calm down. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1880.46s)]
*  It's going to be fine. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1884.8600000000001s)]
*  For those who don't know, Pete Worden was the head of NASA Ames. He was a general in the Air Force. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1885.98s)]
*  He was part of the Strategic Defense Initiative back in the 80s under Reagan. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1891.42s)]
*  A dear co-conspirator in the entire space flight revolution and a dear friend. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1897.1000000000001s)]
*  And because I'm a bit of a peace-loving hippie that prefers peace in space, not SDI in space, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1903.8200000000002s)]
*  I think I won because he was working at NASA. He says he won because I work for him. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1909.5s)]
*  Or something like that. Anyway. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1915.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, Robbie, Chris and I just said at this point, let's spin this out as a company. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1917.4199999999998s)]
*  We took our core spacecraft team. We replaced everyone at NASA first because we wanted to do [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1922.86s)]
*  good by NASA. And we took our core team. Steve kindly, having routed us out, he went to him and [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1927.26s)]
*  said, come on, you've got to give us the money for this. And he was like, okay, you guys are just [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1936.06s)]
*  crazy enough. I've only done one space investment before. It just a year or two earlier, invested in [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1940.1399999999999s)]
*  first money into SpaceX. Steve Jurbetson, one of the most brilliant venture capitalists on the [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1947.18s)]
*  board of SpaceX, had been on the board of Tesla and has the most magnificent space collectibles [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1953.26s)]
*  collection of Russian and NASA components and hardware and meteorites and everything. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1961.26s)]
*  Yeah, he's great. How much did he get in the first round? Do you remember? [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1968.38s)]
*  That was, yeah, three million seed. Then he led also the A, which is another 12 million, I want [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1972.06s)]
*  to say. But that also had some participation from other people. So did the seed. He led the first two [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1979.4199999999998s)]
*  and then the B was led by Yuri Milner, 50 million put in. No, he put in 30 or 50 or something. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1987.26s)]
*  And then the C round was Data Collective and International Finance Corporation and a bunch [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=1993.98s)]
*  of others. And then the D round was essentially instigated because we bought [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2000.86s)]
*  the satellite arm of Google. Google then became a lot of- [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2004.3799999999999s)]
*  Slow it down. So during that time- I go at eight kilometers a second. It's the nature of satellites. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2007.6599999999999s)]
*  So in that window time, this is the 2010 to 2016, 18 timeframe, both of us were close friends with [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2014.2199999999998s)]
*  Larry and Sergey and Eric Schmidt. You were on the campus there of NASA Ames, which is where [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2026.54s)]
*  Google keeps their airplanes and I had Singularity University there. And talk about the first time [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2032.46s)]
*  you connected with the Google guys and start talking about orbiting satellites and things like [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2039.26s)]
*  that. Yeah, well, it was a little bit random. In 2006 or 2007, when I first got to Ames, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2046.06s)]
*  I like hiking on the weekends and I hiked from my house where we started planning and did the [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2054.62s)]
*  first satellite in the garage to the sea, which turns out to be quite a hike and I hadn't really [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2059.3399999999997s)]
*  exactly planned it out with my girlfriend at the time, about an 80 kilometer, 50 mile hike, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2063.3399999999997s)]
*  two days from there to the sea. So basically over the mountains to Big Basin and then down to the [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2068.06s)]
*  sea. By the time we got there, there was only one bus a day and it left. We just missed it. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2073.66s)]
*  Cell phones didn't work there because we're in the middle of nowhere. So we get to this beach and [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2081.82s)]
*  we're like, damn, how exactly are we going to get out of here? And my girlfriend was basically [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2086.6200000000003s)]
*  divorcing me at this point. So that's a bad plan. Anyway, so we're coming down to this beach and I [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2091.9s)]
*  said, well, I hope these guys are friendly because there's three people on the beach kite surfing. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2099.26s)]
*  And one of them turns out to be a friend of mine called Don Montague, who is a wonderful guy and [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2103.42s)]
*  helped to teach Sergey and Larry to kite surf. And it was the other two people were Sergey and Larry. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2111.9s)]
*  And when they came in off their boards, I was like, oh, hi, Don, great to see you. Can you give me a [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2117.58s)]
*  lift home? And he was like, no, I'm not going your way, but these guys are. I'm in the car with my [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2123.26s)]
*  girlfriend and Sergey and Larry, who are giving me a ride home now. And they're like, can you stop? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2129.1s)]
*  Can we stop for dinner? I was like, of course, sure. Let's stop for dinner and we get chatting. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2134.62s)]
*  And my girlfriend's like, what do you guys do? And they're like, we work at Google, how they put it. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2139.18s)]
*  And I was like, wait a second, their names Larry and Sergey and they work at Google. Okay. I think [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2145.8199999999997s)]
*  I know who this is. And she's like, well, what do you do exactly at Google? And they're like, well, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2151.9s)]
*  you know, set board strategy. I'm kicking around to the table. I think these are the guys that [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2156.22s)]
*  started it. Anyway, became friends with those guys early on and they got very interested in space. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2161.02s)]
*  I came around to see our lunar lander demo to do, see some of the missions that we were like the [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2167.18s)]
*  one we slammed in the south pole of moon looking for water. They came around for even though it was [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2174.22s)]
*  landing in the middle of the night, two or three AM and they came. Yeah. So they were interested [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2178.7s)]
*  in that stuff. So they follow this is where sometimes serendipity and good luck plays a hand. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2182.7s)]
*  Yeah. And so you start planet and Steve invests. And when do you start sniffing around the fact [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2188.7s)]
*  that Google had satellites? Well, they bought a Terra Bella or sky box imaging, which became [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2198.9399999999996s)]
*  Terra Bella. I want to say in 2015. And so they bought that to start a satellite arm and they [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2205.74s)]
*  actually were sniffing around us too at the time. And we wanted to say separate and they [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2214.4599999999996s)]
*  bought this arm and well, we thought it was fine. And they were going to do that. Of course, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2222.54s)]
*  it's a little bit competitive. Skybox at that time was the sub one meter resolution. These are a [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2226.62s)]
*  larger, much more expensive satellites. I was saying at the zoom in because then subsequently [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2233.26s)]
*  Google decided not to continue that investment and spin that out. They came and approached us. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2238.7000000000003s)]
*  And Eric, who was then an investor, had suggested that we have a discussion on that and we did. And [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2243.98s)]
*  then one thing led to another and we ended up buying this satellite arm, not for cash. Google [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2252.86s)]
*  has plenty of cash and we had very little. So it made more sense for us to give stock in exchange [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2259.02s)]
*  for those assets. And then Google came and showed up. Hey everyone, I want to take a quick break [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2264.38s)]
*  from this episode to tell you about a health product that I love and that I use every day. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2269.1s)]
*  In fact, I use it twice a day. It's seeds DSO one daily symbiotic. Hopefully by now you understand [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2274.38s)]
*  that your microbiome and your gut health are one of the most important modifiable parts of your [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2281.74s)]
*  health. Your gut microbiome is connected to everything. Your brain health, your cardiac [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2286.54s)]
*  health, your metabolic health. So the question is, what are you doing to optimize your gut? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2291.34s)]
*  Let me take a moment to tell you about what I'm doing. Every day I take two capsules of seeds [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2295.82s)]
*  DSO one daily symbiotic. It's a two in one probiotic and prebiotic formulation that supports [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2301.02s)]
*  digested health, gut health, skin health, heart health and more. It contains 24 clinically and [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2307.82s)]
*  scientifically proven probiotic strains that are delivered in a patented capsule that actually [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2313.74s)]
*  protects the contents from your stomach acid and ensures that a hundred percent of it is [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2319.3399999999997s)]
*  survivable reaching your colon. Now, if you want to try seeds DSO one daily symbiotic for yourself, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2324.7s)]
*  you can get 25% off your first month's supply by using the code Peter 25 at checkout. Just go to [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2331.02s)]
*  seed.com slash moonshots and enter the code Peter 25 at checkout. That's seed.com slash moonshots [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2337.9s)]
*  and use the code Peter 25 to get your 25% off the first month of seeds daily symbiotic. Trust me, [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2346.62s)]
*  your gut will thank you. All right, let's go back to the episode. Do you still call the smaller [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2353.58s)]
*  satellite dubs? Yeah. I love that. And describe those small satellites. Yeah, they're about this [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2358.38s)]
*  big. They weigh about five or seven kilograms. So, you know, 10 or 15 pounds. They spread their [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2365.1s)]
*  wings out to close to the solar panels. They're solar panels. Exactly. Yeah. And they show up a [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2373.42s)]
*  little bit from there. Actually, we get data rates of two gigabits a second. They're over a thousand [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2380.62s)]
*  kilometer range from our little radios now. That's amazing. What altitude are you flying at? I mean, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2385.9s)]
*  people need to know the lower the altitude, the better the resolution, the better com rate, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2391.1s)]
*  but the degradation you degrade in orbit. Yeah. That's right. What's your trade there? [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2396.3s)]
*  Yeah. Well, our trade is we choose about three year life. Our thinking is that just like you don't [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2401.42s)]
*  want a three year old phone in your pocket, you don't want a three year old satellite in space, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2406.14s)]
*  it starts to become obsolete. And just the same actually, really every, we've launched on average [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2411.34s)]
*  four times. We've launched 35 rockets, over 500 satellites. We launch on average four times a year. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2417.26s)]
*  And every time we're iterating the technology to make it better and better, just like every time [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2423.7400000000002s)]
*  you buy a new phone, it's got the bigger camera, a better hard drive, whatever. We're doing the same. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2427.1000000000004s)]
*  And we call that strapping space to Moore's law to make it better and better in that place of data [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2432.5400000000004s)]
*  per dollar, you know, which is the sort of the vector we're trying, the metric we're trying to [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2438.7000000000003s)]
*  optimize. So we've seen a 10,000 fold increase from our first satellite to our satellite today [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2443.9s)]
*  in terms of data per dollar. Wow. That's incredible. I mean, that is Moore's law. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2451.82s)]
*  And are you mostly launching on SpaceX these days or? [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2459.26s)]
*  SpaceX, we've launched 35 times on 10 different rocket vehicles. But indeed, SpaceX and the PSLV, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2462.7000000000003s)]
*  I think SpaceX has been our most common one of all. PSLV is India, right? [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2471.66s)]
*  And we've launched on other vehicles as well, the European Vega, the US Atlas, others. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2477.42s)]
*  And when you, I mean, when Starship starts, I mean, you could launch all 200 at once. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2483.42s)]
*  No, we could launch like 10,000 at once. It's crazy. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2490.2999999999997s)]
*  I mean, yeah. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2493.8999999999996s)]
*  No, it's crazy. I mean, you know, I do worry about the A380 problem with that. Like, it's not clear [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2496.2999999999997s)]
*  that there's yet a market for the vehicle. It's not impedance matched with people's ability to [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2503.82s)]
*  build satellites yet. The only satellite fleet that can fill it up at the minute is really Starlink [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2510.22s)]
*  itself. But then that doesn't help. You know, they're only their own customer. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2515.02s)]
*  Do you feel, I mean, Planet used to have the biggest, baddest, most satellites in orbit. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2520.2200000000003s)]
*  We had the largest satellite fleet, but Elon came over and did more. Yeah, I know. It's kind of [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2528.46s)]
*  annoying. They're bigger satellites and he's got more of them. I'm pretty outraged by this. No, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2532.86s)]
*  it's good. Look, we're all obviously trying to do things to help the planet. And I commend what they [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2538.2200000000003s)]
*  have done with Starlink and the rockets, of course, the reusability. I was a doubter on that. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2544.7s)]
*  I thought the reusability was too hard and he did it. I mean, you and I have both been for the last [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2551.02s)]
*  25 years, space cadets, and it was always the holy grail of reusability. Yeah. I mean, it was. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2555.66s)]
*  He pulled it off. Yeah. And he pulled it off. Yeah. It's incredible. You'll see this as Elon, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2561.8999999999996s)]
*  of course, is a huge team. But Elon, of course, has been an inspiring leader for them to do that. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2566.7s)]
*  You know, this past three years, we got Elon to fund $100 million gigaton carbon removal [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2573.02s)]
*  XPRIZE. They try and stem the tide of the environmental destruction. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2581.34s)]
*  And you have become an extraordinarily outspoken individual on the environment. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2590.86s)]
*  And I think part of what you're trying to do with Planet is give us the tools to measure the Planet [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2598.14s)]
*  in a way that allows us to hold companies, individuals, dictators, nation states, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2604.54s)]
*  responsible for the impact they're having because despite the borders that exist, they don't [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2611.5s)]
*  prohibit the free movement of pollutants and CO2. So talk a little bit about that. So if people [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2617.2599999999998s)]
*  listening are not convinced or need some persuasion on the state of affairs, [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2627.34s)]
*  give us your best shot. No, I mean, look, from our 10,000 foot view, or in our case, 400 kilometer [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2639.82s)]
*  view, we see the whole planet and I see it evolving. The facts are stuck. And humans have [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2648.46s)]
*  obviously manipulated the planet. We've got two big problems. The one that everyone knows about [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2656.14s)]
*  and the one that everyone doesn't. The one that everyone knows about is climate and how we are [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2662.54s)]
*  emitting too much CO2 and it's warming the planet. And obviously we're having extreme weather events [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2667.8199999999997s)]
*  now. That's exactly what the scientists have said. It's the first thing you get is that. And, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2675.66s)]
*  and of course, sea level rising, whole nation states being wiped out. The second is [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2680.78s)]
*  biodiversity loss. And this is where we're wiping out ecosystems of life. And you might think, [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2688.2200000000003s)]
*  well, why does that matter to humans? I mean, they're just up there, some, whatever, some [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2695.7400000000002s)]
*  animals in the jungle. Why does it matter for us? It matters for us because it is estimated that [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2701.34s)]
*  half our economy depends upon what they call nature services, which is that the trees and the [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2707.5s)]
*  soils and the mycelium and the plants clean our water and they clean our air and they do all these [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2714.38s)]
*  things. And we don't have the industrial capability to replace that. We don't have the technology. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2720.62s)]
*  We are fully, fully dependent on the rest of life. And in the last 40 years, in my lifetime, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2726.7s)]
*  we've wiped out 70% of the life on the earth. 82% of wild mammals gone in 40 years. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2734.62s)]
*  75% of fish in freshwater rivers and lakes gone in the last 40 years. 70% of insects [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2742.06s)]
*  gone in the last 40 years. 70, 66% of birds over half the coral reefs, over half the forest, [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2749.8199999999997s)]
*  all gone. And we think it retrievably gone. And we think we can do that without there being [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2757.5s)]
*  consequences for us. We are so naive. And what is driving that is deforestation, overfishing, [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2764.46s)]
*  it's human pollutions from agriculture into rivers. It's all these sort of things. And [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2773.9s)]
*  that is just a big problem as climate change. And they couple, of course, to make things worse. Now [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2782.3s)]
*  the Amazon is not any longer a net CO2 sucker because of the climatic events. And then that [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2789.02s)]
*  means it's more likely to fall over as an ecosystem. We are dealing with a complicated system. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2797.2599999999998s)]
*  Humans need to afforest, reforest a lot of the land. We need to stop our overfishing. We need to [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2803.9s)]
*  do these things. And there's things humans, individuals can do for this, right? We've got to, [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2811.3399999999997s)]
*  reduce our intake of meat, which is what drives 70% of deforestation is for cows. We've got to [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2817.9s)]
*  reduce our, of course, use of fossil fuels and those things. And there's things we could do to [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2826.62s)]
*  help as well, like helping in our local parks to plant trees, to help rewild local parks. I'm [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2834.62s)]
*  involved with a project that is just rewilding an area, about a thousand hectares, here in San [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2841.26s)]
*  Francisco, to try and bring back the native ecosystems after over usage, both mining and [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2848.0600000000004s)]
*  over cattle usage of an area that wiped out most of the natives. It's hard work. And I wanted to [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2855.1800000000003s)]
*  understand what it takes on the ground because we're trying to help people with satellite imagery [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2860.6200000000003s)]
*  all over the world to do these conservation efforts. But yeah, the situation is somewhat [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2864.46s)]
*  tragic. What I would say is we have wicked problems and we have wicked tools to go help them. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2869.5s)]
*  And our aim at Planet is to help provide everyone those tools. Let me give you an example. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2876.62s)]
*  We are trying to switch to a sustainable economy. For that, we basically have to measure nature and [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2882.7s)]
*  carbon and put it into our economic system. At the end of every year, every company and every country [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2890.46s)]
*  on the planet is going to need to balance its carbon books, just like you balance your finances. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2897.5s)]
*  And just like doing that, of course, the first step is measuring where all the carbon is, [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2903.34s)]
*  whereas it's all in your satellite chain. You can all do a personal carbon budget. You'll find that [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2908.3s)]
*  flying around is probably the worst bit, as I did. But you need to balance that budget. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2912.3s)]
*  Well, how do you offset your carbon of your flights or whatever? Well, you can grow trees, [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2918.3s)]
*  you can change transition farms to sustainable farming practices. Well, how do you know that's [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2923.1s)]
*  happening when you do that? Well, you need satellite data that can do that. We just launched, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2928.2999999999997s)]
*  just a few weeks ago, one of my proudest launches for Planet, not a rocket launch, but a launch of a [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2933.8199999999997s)]
*  data product called Forest Carbon Planetary Variable. We are measuring the carbon across [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2942.46s)]
*  the whole forest of the earth and helping to quantify how much carbon is in the trees. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2950.7s)]
*  And we're actually doing it at a three by three meter level every quarter and going back 10 years. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2956.7799999999997s)]
*  And that means pretty much that each tree will be able to say how much carbon is in the tree. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2962.06s)]
*  Why does that matter? Well, it matters because if we're going to have carbon markets where [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2966.3799999999997s)]
*  Microsoft says, I want to offset my carbon of all my execs flying around, and some people in the [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2970.7799999999997s)]
*  Amazon say, well, we'll plant some trees or stop deforestation in my area. Somebody needs to act [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2976.46s)]
*  as the bridge that says, indeed, they have done that and how much carbon has increased, right? [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2983.26s)]
*  You need a carbon economy and we've been lacking that, but it all depends on this core measurement. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2988.94s)]
*  So you make possible actually an XPRIZE I've wanted to do for a while. I've wanted to do, [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=2995.34s)]
*  for lack of a better term, the Trillion Trees XPRIZE, which is any team can register and can [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3001.98s)]
*  claim a plot of land where they're going to plant trees. They've got to have permission from the [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3008.94s)]
*  land owner, could be a government location and so forth. And we measure, and hopefully there are [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3016.62s)]
*  thousands of teams in 100 plus countries around the world, and we measure who wins. Now, one wins [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3023.58s)]
*  by getting the most, but there's this massive long tail over the course of a decade. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3029.18s)]
*  You know, I'm a big fan of your prizes because I think they incentivize innovation as well as [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3035.1s)]
*  much more capital in than the prize givers give. It's kind of amazing it happens. Yeah, [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3040.22s)]
*  and I think you could even do it by carbon. Of course, you have to restrict it by, and there [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3044.7s)]
*  was a mistake a little bit in New Zealand where they tried to do this based on carbon, and then [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3048.8599999999997s)]
*  everyone planted pine trees, which turned out to be fastest at adding carbon, but they were not [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3053.26s)]
*  native. They hurt a lot of the other species, and then when the wind blew, they all fell down. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3058.86s)]
*  So you have to do the right kind of trees, but subject to certain caveats, you want to incentivize [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3063.42s)]
*  people to do that. Also, to restore existing forest, people are taking a few trees out. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3067.9s)]
*  And the idea is to be able to measure that to underpin carbon markets or carbon prizes, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3074.3s)]
*  the kind you're just saying. Love it. Well, we have a lot of moonshot entrepreneurs, people who've [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3079.66s)]
*  got big ideas, or I dare call exponential entrepreneurs. Can you mind sharing some of [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3086.54s)]
*  your lessons learned? Like in some of the challenges or problems or like, you know, [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3093.18s)]
*  what was it that led you to this extraordinary success of building this, you know, and now as [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3100.2999999999997s)]
*  a public company CEO and a company, frankly, that has 100x growth potential as you measure the world, [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3107.5s)]
*  it's huge. It's a data company. It's an AI company that uses satellite technology, [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3115.42s)]
*  but the journey could not have been easy. What were some of the lessons learned? What's the advice [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3120.94s)]
*  you have for entrepreneurs out there? Well, look, I think the biggest thing is that it takes time, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3125.34s)]
*  grit and endurance. A lot of people list all the things that differentiate good startups and bad [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3131.82s)]
*  startups with the right idea, the right timing, all these things. I'd say by far the biggest one [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3141.42s)]
*  is endurance. As you put it to me once, and it's one of the sadiest pieces of advice I ever received, [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3146.86s)]
*  and it was to do with your project and the first X Prize, the Ansari X Prize. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3156.1400000000003s)]
*  You said for eight years, no one noticed what you were doing, basically. No one even figured it out. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3161.26s)]
*  I remember you showing me a little clip from the LA Times that was like this big on page 40, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3169.7400000000002s)]
*  how proud you were that somebody had, you know, it was something like that. And I was like, [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3175.5800000000004s)]
*  wow, you know, Peter's great. And then two years later, it was front page of every headline on the [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3179.82s)]
*  planet. The exponentials are hard to understand. And humans don't have good intuition for it, [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3186.54s)]
*  as you've explained many times. And so towards the end, you get a big effect. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3195.58s)]
*  So you could do, you know, and as the Silicon Valley adage goes, you always underestimate what [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3200.94s)]
*  you can do in a year, sorry, overestimate what you can do in a year and underestimate what you [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3206.78s)]
*  can do in 10. It takes 10. The safe piece of advice, I should say, is the thing you said, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3210.38s)]
*  it takes because of that experience, it takes 10 years to do anything meaningful in the world. 10 [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3217.1s)]
*  years. Yeah, you had 11 year from coming up with the idea until the company went public. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3222.62s)]
*  X Prize was 11 years for me too. It's 10, 12 years. If you're tackling a problem that's actually [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3230.2200000000003s)]
*  going to have serious impact in the world, not just a frivolous thing. And it's not going to [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3235.9s)]
*  happen in a year. It's going to happen in 10. So, wow, you know, that's just a reality, I think. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3243.66s)]
*  And there's huge rewards for it, but you have to stick with it. And the number of people that [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3251.42s)]
*  told me no, you know, I can't even count. Right? I mean, no, you can't do it. No, you can't have [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3255.18s)]
*  money. No, there's no business. No, you can't build those satellites. Blah, blah, blah, blah, [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3261.66s)]
*  blah, blah, blah. So I had to keep going, you know, and our team had to weather through that. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3265.42s)]
*  And that's it takes a certain sense of endurance as well as as idea and timing [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3272.06s)]
*  and all the rest of it, which obviously you need to. But and luck, a whole heap of luck. Right? I [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3278.8599999999997s)]
*  mean, you know, I mentioned the Sergey and Larry thing. I mean, what the heck? Right place at the [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3284.8599999999997s)]
*  right time. And like, so some of that just. But one would say luck comes from perseverance as well. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3290.8599999999997s)]
*  Like you stick around long enough. Totally, totally. And to take risks. Right. And so, [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3298.14s)]
*  so yeah, nothing ventured, nothing gained and all that. So I definitely [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3303.58s)]
*  would say you've got to stick with it. The other thing I would say is tackle something that's [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3308.94s)]
*  meaningful in the world. Life's too short. Don't ever start the strategy that looks like this. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3313.2599999999998s)]
*  I will do this thing, which doesn't sound that interesting. Cool tech. But really, the main [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3319.2599999999998s)]
*  thing is I'll get rich and then I'll be a philanthropist to give the money away. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3326.14s)]
*  Such bullshit. It's ridiculous. It's that vote with your feet, do something useful every day. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3331.2599999999998s)]
*  Don't wait a few years until you're rich enough to then do cool stuff. Do cool stuff with your feet. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3338.46s)]
*  You know, there's, you know, I gave it to Augustin for us to come with this. So it I have a basic [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3344.06s)]
*  test for that. If you should be able to, whatever your idea is, you should be able to look at the [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3350.06s)]
*  UN development goals, the standard development goals, and check a few that that goal, that project [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3356.94s)]
*  helps. And if you can't, if the answers are null set, you should be looking seriously at that idea. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3363.02s)]
*  You know? And let me be honest, like there's a lot of apps in Silicon Valley that maybe [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3369.02s)]
*  are brilliant companies. No more photo sharing apps, please. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3374.2999999999997s)]
*  Exactly. What the heck? That may make money and it is perfectly waste of time. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3379.2599999999998s)]
*  And I used to think of this as like, okay, well, that's cool. Different people do different things [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3384.62s)]
*  and that's helpful. Except when you think about all the challenges of the planet, we can't waste [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3388.14s)]
*  loads of the best engineers. This is what gives me pain about a Facebook right now. And I don't [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3394.06s)]
*  mean to pick them up, but like, I don't see, it's not clear it's net positive to the world. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3398.62s)]
*  And again, you could say, well, it doesn't matter. Cool stuff, cool tech. I'm sure [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3404.62s)]
*  some interesting tech will come out of it. It's definitely good, but there's definitely bad in [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3410.46s)]
*  terms of rooting information ecology with, you know, echo chambers and stuff. But I think it's [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3414.14s)]
*  much worse than that. You are putting 40,000 or whatever it is engineers who aren't solving the [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3421.98s)]
*  world's problems. They're just helping us to share pictures. What the fuck? I mean, there's people [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3427.98s)]
*  starving on the planet. I'm sorry. You know, just not where we need to be putting our time [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3432.78s)]
*  and resources when we have, you know, a half a billion people that are undernourished, [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3439.1800000000003s)]
*  a climate change challenge, a biodiversity loss, all the problems that we have in the world. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3444.38s)]
*  So life's too short. If it doesn't hit one of the big goals for the planet, don't do it. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3450.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. The way I put it is if you want to become a billionaire, help a billion people [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3455.02s)]
*  and the world's biggest problem is the world's biggest business opportunities. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3459.26s)]
*  Absolutely. Absolutely. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3462.38s)]
*  Everybody want to take a short break from our episode to talk about a company that's [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3464.78s)]
*  very important to me and could actually save your life or the life of someone that you love. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3468.3s)]
*  The company is called Fountain Life and it's a company I started years ago with Tony Robbins [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3473.6600000000003s)]
*  and a group of very talented physicians. You know, most of us don't actually know what's going on [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3478.94s)]
*  inside our body. We're all optimists. Until that day when you have a pain in your side, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3484.62s)]
*  you go to the physician in the emergency room and they say, listen, I'm sorry to tell you this, [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3490.22s)]
*  but you have this stage three or four going on. And you know, it didn't start that morning. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3493.8999999999996s)]
*  It probably was a problem that's been going on for some time, but because we never look, [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3500.14s)]
*  we don't find out. So what we built at Fountain Life was the world's most advanced diagnostic [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3505.66s)]
*  centers. We have four across the US today and we're building 20 around the world. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3512.2999999999997s)]
*  These centers give you a full body MRI, a brain, a brain vasculature, an AI enabled coronary CT [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3517.34s)]
*  looking for soft plaque, dexa scan, a grail blood cancer test, a full executive blood workup. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3524.1400000000003s)]
*  It's the most advanced workup you'll ever receive. 150 gigabytes of data that then go to our AIs and [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3530.78s)]
*  our physicians to find any disease at the very beginning when it's solvable. You're going to find [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3538.2200000000003s)]
*  out eventually. You might as well find out when you can take action. Fountain Life also has an [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3544.7s)]
*  entire side of therapeutics. We look around the world for the most advanced therapeutics that can [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3549.8199999999997s)]
*  add 10, 20 healthy years to your life and we provide them to you at our centers. So if this [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3553.8999999999996s)]
*  is of interest to you, please go and check it out. Go to fountainlife.com backslash Peter. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3560.7799999999997s)]
*  When Tony and I wrote our New York Times bestseller Life Force, we had 30,000 people [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3568.8599999999997s)]
*  reach out to us for Fountain Life memberships. You go to fountainlife.com backslash Peter. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3574.94s)]
*  We'll put you to the top of the list. Really it's something that is for me one of the most [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3580.06s)]
*  important things I offer my entire family, the CEOs of my companies, my friends. It's a chance to [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3586.22s)]
*  really add decades onto our healthy lifespans. Go to fountainlife.com backslash Peter. It's one of [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3592.54s)]
*  the most important things I can offer to you as one of my listeners. All right, let's go back to [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3600.06s)]
*  our episode. You know, I'll close out with something else. We just landed on the moon, [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3604.7s)]
*  which is fun. First commercial, private commercial vehicle to make it and you and I have been [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3612.38s)]
*  Lunites for quite some time. You were involved with Pete Worden on a few, shall we say, [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3620.86s)]
*  undercover unusual lunar missions. Area 51 lunar missions, yeah. Yeah, to crash into the South Pole [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3628.46s)]
*  and image the lunar poles looking for ice in permanently shadowed areas because ice is [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3636.7s)]
*  the Saudi oil fields of the moon, liquid oxygen and hydrogen. I just announced on a podcast, [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3645.02s)]
*  went back with Bill Gross from Idea Lab and we talked about the blast off lunar mission we [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3653.1800000000003s)]
*  had worked on for a number of years. And of course, Google Lunar X Prize that you were [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3660.94s)]
*  familiar of, we had 26 teams, three made attempts and Intuitive was the fourth team that made an [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3666.38s)]
*  attempt and it pulled it off. They stuck the landing. It was the harbour. Yeah, amazing. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3673.5s)]
*  Makes you proud. Now, wasn't quite the lunar rover in 1972 bouncing around with humans, [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3680.22s)]
*  but just like your phone set has evolved, the evolution of what we'll see, especially [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3687.5s)]
*  a starship gets to the moon is going to be awesome. Are you still a Lunite over Mars guy? [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3695.66s)]
*  Oh, God. Yeah. Yeah. It's like a thousand times easier to put a settlement on the moon than Mars. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3701.5s)]
*  Look, I mean, I think we've mainly got to pay attention to this planet, but I mean, [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3709.26s)]
*  the moon is inspiring to me. I think that it's a place where I would love to visit there and look [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3713.26s)]
*  back at how big the earth is in the sky, four times wider than the moon is in our sky and see [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3717.98s)]
*  the continents and get that perspective that I think that helps people to understand our place. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3724.2200000000003s)]
*  But practically and technically, it is just far easier than Mars because Mars has the [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3733.5s)]
*  annoying thing of an atmosphere, which for spacefaring species is really annoying. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3739.5s)]
*  It's only useful if you can actually breathe it, which you can't on Mars. If you can't breathe it, [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3745.1000000000004s)]
*  then it just makes landing and taking off much harder. You still have to wear a space suit, [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3748.94s)]
*  you can't land and take off. And the moon is one and a half or two days or three days travel time, [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3752.6200000000003s)]
*  whereas ours is eight months and you can go any day of the week, which makes a big difference. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3758.1400000000003s)]
*  2.4 second round trip by the speed of light. You can have a conversation. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3762.5400000000004s)]
*  Exactly. You can have a conversation, whereas you can't on Mars. Just the difficulty delta [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3766.94s)]
*  is orders of magnitude. I think we did this estimate, this workshop where we're at Ames, [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3771.82s)]
*  where we estimated even with Falcon 9, forget Starship, and by the way, Falcon 9 is perfectly [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3780.78s)]
*  adequate for this. You could put a settlement on the moon that we think would be self-sustaining, [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3789.26s)]
*  being able to do its core things of being able to mend everything that would break, [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3794.7s)]
*  that would be life system critical for a couple of billion dollars. What the heck? That seems like a [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3800.22s)]
*  reasonable, why wouldn't we do that? I mean, it's something an individual can do, right? [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3807.02s)]
*  Yeah. Elon or Bezos. Yeah, some of our friends can do that and they wouldn't even know it does [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3813.8999999999996s)]
*  be from the bank account. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, look, again, most of our energy has got to be on [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3818.46s)]
*  Terra Pharma. We've got so many challenges, but it's inspiring and I think it makes sense at that [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3824.06s)]
*  sort of scale to have backup plans for humanity. So, yeah. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3830.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3836.38s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3852.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3866.38s)]
*  This instruction. Exactly. Yeah. If I could just riff off that, I think, at least that, yeah, [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3876.38s)]
*  it's a tool that enable, but it's an ecosystem for sure. There's no way we can do all the [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3886.54s)]
*  applications as one company that is held to help use this data to help make smarter decisions or [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3893.26s)]
*  help make lives better around the planet. There's just a billion companies that could be built off [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3900.78s)]
*  the top of this, an application. So, yeah, AI makes it easier as well. So you don't have to have, [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3906.1400000000003s)]
*  again, a PhD in satellite imagery processing to get to grips with this. This is a standard API. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3914.46s)]
*  You say your AOI, your area of interest, your time of interest, your TOI, and then we'll just [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3918.94s)]
*  give you the data or even we'll give you analytics feeds, like how much carbon is in all the trees or [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3923.66s)]
*  where all the ships or whatever, and we'll just give you lat longs and these things. This is [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3929.58s)]
*  getting easier and easier. And so I think we're successful only, not only we can enable that, [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3933.9s)]
*  we're only successful as a planet if we help companies to do that as an ecosystem. This is [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3941.34s)]
*  like the iPhone App Store, but for building solutions to help the planet. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3945.9s)]
*  I was going to say that, yeah. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3950.3s)]
*  I want thousands of ecopreneurs, as Mark Benioff likes to say, of entrepreneurs that are focused [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3952.38s)]
*  on helping the planet, building off of the top of planet's data. I mean, let me say one other thing. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3958.46s)]
*  As I said, we've got wicked problems, wicked technologies to help solve them. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3969.98s)]
*  I disagree with your abundance thing a little bit here. Some of those problems are so acute [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3976.54s)]
*  that I think that we're going to need technology solutions like renewable energy and better data [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3982.62s)]
*  solutions, and we're going to have to consume less material resources because there's no [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3987.82s)]
*  way that you can get more digital resources, but you can't consume more than we're currently [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3994.78s)]
*  consuming. It's eating the planet. That's what we're seeing. The mining, even if you swap the [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=3998.54s)]
*  renewable energy, for example, we're seeing all the mining for lithium for more batteries. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=4002.3s)]
*  In the end, we also just need to eat a little less, waste less. We waste 45% of our food. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=4007.1800000000003s)]
*  We need to conserve a little bit more on electricity and things. That combination [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=4013.82s)]
*  is what we're going to need to get out of here. It's a matter of smart use of our present stuff, [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=4018.54s)]
*  smart technologies like renewable energy, and smart use of our present stuff, including [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=4022.94s)]
*  a personal behavior level. We're going to have to change our behavior a little bit. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=4030.06s)]
*  I respect the reduction in waste and I respect the increase in efficiency. I think for the first [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=4034.06s)]
*  time ever, we've got the tools to begin to think through that and to do that. Listen, if you're a [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=4042.54s)]
*  moonshot entrepreneur and you're trying to figure out your next gig, what would you do with an [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=4050.14s)]
*  incredible information layer on top of the earth that is getting deeper and richer and accessible [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=4055.34s)]
*  through APIs and AI engines? I can start imagining a whole slew of different startups I'd be doing. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=4062.2200000000003s)]
*  Maybe it's a little bit of inspiration. Again, thank you to you, Will, to Robbie, to Chris for [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=4071.1800000000003s)]
*  founding Planet. A real pleasure to have you as a friend and so proud of what you've built. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=4079.02s)]
*  Thanks a lot, Peter. It's been a pleasure to have this conversation with you today. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLOUC13wFk&t=4084.06s)]
