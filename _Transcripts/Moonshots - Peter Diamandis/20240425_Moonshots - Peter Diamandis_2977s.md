# 2 Ex-AI CEOs Debate the Future of AI w/ Emad Mostaque & Nat Friedman | EP #98
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [April 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ)
*  What I think happened in the last year really is the starting gun was fired. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=0.0s)]
*  We spent a trillion dollars on 5G. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=6.12s)]
*  Is AI more impactful than 5G? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=10.16s)]
*  Of course it is. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=11.68s)]
*  Do we actually know what's going on inside the models? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=12.8s)]
*  We can measure everything and still we don't really quite understand mechanically what's [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=16.36s)]
*  happening inside them. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=22.04s)]
*  They're not engineered and designed, they're kind of grown. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  AI is clearly more capable than humans now. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=26.12s)]
*  We know this is going to get better. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=28.7s)]
*  When does it slow down? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=31.259999999999998s)]
*  Right now it's a few companies doing this, but we need standards around it and we need [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=32.54s)]
*  the expansion. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=36.5s)]
*  And again, every country will invest in this. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=37.5s)]
*  Every company will invest in this. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=39.46s)]
*  We're here to talk about what happened. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=43.019999999999996s)]
*  I almost say WTF just happened in the past year because a lot has happened. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=44.739999999999995s)]
*  Emad, you were on stage with me a year ago and things were amazing then, but a lot has [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=48.9s)]
*  happened. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=55.22s)]
*  Let's split this into a couple of parts. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=56.22s)]
*  What just happened the last year? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=58.26s)]
*  And then I want to talk about how far forward can you see? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=60.18s)]
*  What do you expect is going to happen? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=63.18s)]
*  I'd love to talk about the companies, the models, the dramas. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=66.14s)]
*  What did Ilya see? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=70.62s)]
*  I think that's going to become a meme. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=71.62s)]
*  Nat, do you want to kick us off? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=74.62s)]
*  What's the big things that happened in the last calendar year in your mind? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=78.66s)]
*  Well, yeah, it's been kind of an amazing year. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=82.94s)]
*  I do think for people who just started paying attention to this sort of new AI and deep [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=86.94s)]
*  learning revolution in November of 22 when chat GPT came out, things probably seemed [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=92.25999999999999s)]
*  very fast because we had stable diffusion come out over the summer. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=100.02s)]
*  Previously in 22 we had chat GPT in November and then just a few months later GPT 4 came [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=106.5s)]
*  out and demonstrated a new level of capabilities that were shockingly improved over what was [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=111.30000000000001s)]
*  there previously. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=117.74000000000001s)]
*  So I do think there's a set of people who sort of extrapolated from those three data [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=118.74000000000001s)]
*  points in terms of the progress that was going to happen from there. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=124.30000000000001s)]
*  It's incredible actually how quickly people can adapt to these new things. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=128.98000000000002s)]
*  There was a point at which chat GPT blew everyone's minds and then a few months later it was sort [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=134.14000000000001s)]
*  of just something we accepted as part of the world, as part of reality. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=140.34s)]
*  And we can very quickly enter this kind of slump where's the new model, GPT 4 is boring [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=145.94s)]
*  now, when do we get GPT 5, come on Sam, put it out already, what are you waiting for, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=150.78s)]
*  this kind of thing. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=155.58s)]
*  So I think we had a little bit of that this year. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=156.58s)]
*  And then over the course of the year though what we started to see and I had been waiting [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=158.86s)]
*  for this for a while but we started to see real adoption taking off. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=165.38s)]
*  And so back in 2020 GPT 3 had come out and in 2021 when I was running GitHub we put out [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=169.78s)]
*  GitHub Copilot and it was I guess one of the first LLM commercial products and I thought [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=177.06s)]
*  that immediately after that there would be this rapid wave of commercialization of large [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=184.82s)]
*  language models because developers would have seen how capable they were, what they could [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=189.01999999999998s)]
*  do and start building products with them but it really took this kind of chat GPT moment [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=192.66s)]
*  before entrepreneurs, developers and product people started to do this. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=196.70000000000002s)]
*  So what I think happened in the last year really is the starting gun was fired on the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=200.54s)]
*  actual exploitation of these raw capabilities, the building of products, the working of them [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=206.14000000000001s)]
*  into companies and organizations and now that's what we see, the adoption has been incredible. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=212.5s)]
*  Chat GPT is rumored to have gone from basically zero to $2 billion in revenue in just about [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=218.06s)]
*  a year. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=224.26s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=225.74s)]
*  There's organizations like Stability that put out models that have hundreds of millions [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=226.98s)]
*  of users. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=231.98s)]
*  You have mid journey. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=232.98s)]
*  You have now Google in the game finally with Gemini. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=236.14000000000001s)]
*  I thought it was exciting to see them not only release Gemini but very quickly follow [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=239.86s)]
*  up with Gemini 1.5. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=243.3s)]
*  And so there's a way in which Google has clearly internalized the piece here and the need to [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=245.06s)]
*  iterate and ship. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=249.22s)]
*  I don't think a lot of people realize how far ahead Google was for a decade. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=252.18s)]
*  So Google had really developed a lot of the early tech here and said it's not ready for [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=258.06s)]
*  release. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=262.78s)]
*  They were being responsible to a great degree and then how do you not release after Chat [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=263.78s)]
*  GPT gets released? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=270.62s)]
*  They're shipping tilt now. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=271.98s)]
*  They're going to ship. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=272.98s)]
*  They're going to ship, yes. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=274.1s)]
*  Iman, the open model story that you told us last year has really blossomed and in fact [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=276.58000000000004s)]
*  it's become sort of an ethos in the organization. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=284.98s)]
*  Elon is really twisting the knife in with Sam and then says but Grok's going to be open [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=290.82s)]
*  now. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=298.02000000000004s)]
*  Can you talk about what's happened in the last year in open? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=299.02000000000004s)]
*  Will open win? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=301.5s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=303.26000000000005s)]
*  I'm curious for both of you guys. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=304.26000000000005s)]
*  Describe what open is versus closed for the audience here. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=305.26000000000005s)]
*  Yes, so proprietary AI is you don't see the code the way it's anything and it's provided [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=308.06s)]
*  as a service whereas open models and code are ones that you can adapt yourself, you [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=313.1s)]
*  can take, bring to your own data and you own. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=317.46000000000004s)]
*  And that's important because these models are something a bit different. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=319.98s)]
*  They're like extensions of our mind. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=322.3s)]
*  And so the best analogy I've said is that these are actually like graduates. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=324.5s)]
*  They can code, they can write, they can sing. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=328.46000000000004s)]
*  They sometimes go a bit crazy when they try a bit too hard. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=329.94000000000005s)]
*  You know, give them better education. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=332.62s)]
*  And so open models like graduates that you hire and then proprietary models like consultants [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=334.82s)]
*  you bring in. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=339.02s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=340.02s)]
*  And in the early stages we all needed consultants. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=341.02s)]
*  Now people saying well I want this for my own data. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=342.46s)]
*  I want this for that. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=344.09999999999997s)]
*  And open allows for innovation to happen. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=345.9s)]
*  So we've had now 330 million downloads of our models on Hugging Face. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=348.06s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=352.97999999999996s)]
*  So we just don't. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=353.97999999999996s)]
*  And what is Hugging Face for folks? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=354.97999999999996s)]
*  It's GitHub but for AI models. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=355.97999999999996s)]
*  So it's where you go as a developer to download the models. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=358.62s)]
*  And so people, millions and millions of developers are using this technology. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=360.9s)]
*  But then you look at the language model side, people are taking it, adapting it, optimizing [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=364.02s)]
*  it to have innovations that are now catching up with even the proprietary guys. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=367.78s)]
*  But they're complementary. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=372.78s)]
*  You will have your own team and then you'll bring in the specialists. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=374.26s)]
*  I think that's the best way to think about this. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=377.14s)]
*  Because you can't outsource your internal intelligence from a personal company or even [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=379.41999999999996s)]
*  country level to models that you don't know what the provenance are. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=383.06s)]
*  And this is one of the debates that we saw over the last year. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=387.02s)]
*  The first step was like, oh my god, exponential extrapolation. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=388.9s)]
*  And as Nat said, actually, the foundations for this were dug maybe a decade ago. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=392.7s)]
*  And now we've been filling in the cement and now we're all building houses. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=398.29999999999995s)]
*  And we're like, well, the houses have become skyscrapers. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=400.41999999999996s)]
*  So it was like, well, they could kill us all and those are valid things to discuss. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=403.14s)]
*  Then it became about sovereignty and well, GPT-4 is amazing, but I want my own version [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=406.94s)]
*  as well for my own private data. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=411.9s)]
*  And so I think as we advance, proprietary models will always beat open models. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=414.17999999999995s)]
*  The proprietary will always be what? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=418.38s)]
*  Open models. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=419.58s)]
*  Because you can take the open model and bring your private data to it and optimize it. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=420.58s)]
*  Because open models are like generalized graduates, as it were. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=424.1s)]
*  But both of them need to exist. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=427.14s)]
*  I think we'll see both of them continue to take off. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=429.38s)]
*  Do we actually know what's going on inside the models? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=431.62s)]
*  I was listening to a conversation with the chief scientist at Anthropic, who will be [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=435.82s)]
*  on stage with us next year. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=441.62s)]
*  And he's saying we actually don't understand really how these models work. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=444.62s)]
*  Is that a fair statement? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=449.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=451.34s)]
*  I mean, just so you understand, it's like they're amazing, but we actually don't understand [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=452.34s)]
*  how the weights and connections and all are really working. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=459.62s)]
*  I mean, we understand it at this very micro level. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=461.9s)]
*  We can see the multiplications happening and we can see the signal moving to the next layer [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=465.41999999999996s)]
*  in the neural network. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=470.58s)]
*  It's actually sort of similar, although not the same mechanisms, to the way we don't have [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=473.3s)]
*  a perfect understanding of the way thinking happens in our brains. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=477.26s)]
*  Even though in the case of our brains, when we try to do the neuroscience and understand [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=481.9s)]
*  what's happening at the neuron level and the organelle level, we're limited by our measurement. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=486.64s)]
*  We can't measure the state of every single neuron in your brain while you're thinking. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=492.22s)]
*  That's not something we have the sensing technology to do now. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=496.3s)]
*  That's not a problem we have with these AI minds that we're building. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=499.18s)]
*  We can measure everything and still we don't really quite understand mechanically what's [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=503.62s)]
*  happening inside them. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=509.3s)]
*  They're not engineered and designed. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=510.38s)]
*  They're kind of grown. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=512.42s)]
*  They're the products of us, actually, because we have the internet, which digitized the [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=513.42s)]
*  world and put all the data we've produced online. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=519.74s)]
*  And there's a way in which that process of building the internet was like a bootstrapping [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=524.0600000000001s)]
*  process for building AI because it was a precondition to making AI. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=527.94s)]
*  We digitized the world. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=531.7s)]
*  We put all the contents online and then we could use all that to sort of grow and train [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=532.7s)]
*  these AI models, but we don't quite know how they work. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=538.0200000000001s)]
*  Now there's a new field, new not in time, but relatively small field called interpretability, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=540.3000000000001s)]
*  which is about trying to understand what's going on in these things. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=548.3000000000001s)]
*  What are they doing? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=552.7800000000001s)]
*  How do they make the decisions that they make? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=553.7800000000001s)]
*  And really there's benefits if you can do that to making them better in all sorts of [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=557.02s)]
*  ways. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=560.66s)]
*  You can make them smarter, maybe, and make better decisions and you can also hope to [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=561.66s)]
*  make sure they do the thing you want them to do and not something else. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=566.54s)]
*  But it's new. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=571.78s)]
*  Elon put a tweet out, which I read during my opening remarks that said by 20, yeah, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=572.78s)]
*  we're going to have human level AI next year and by 2029 AI will be equivalent to all 8 [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=577.54s)]
*  billion people. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=583.78s)]
*  Do you agree with that, Eman? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=585.5799999999999s)]
*  Do you think it's going to move that fast? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=587.5799999999999s)]
*  I think we had a big discussion about generalized AI that can do everything and that was the [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=589.3s)]
*  focus of DeepMind and OpenAI. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=592.6999999999999s)]
*  But for specific tasks, AI is clearly more capable than humans now. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=594.9s)]
*  So for example, Google's Gemini Ultra model has a million, 10 million token context window. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=599.66s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=605.98s)]
*  It means that someone can upload themselves debugging a piece of code in the code base [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=607.22s)]
*  and it'll correct it. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=611.14s)]
*  And no human could ever do that. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=612.78s)]
*  RAM isn't big enough. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=615.46s)]
*  On image now, we can generate images faster than anything, songs in seconds and other [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=617.46s)]
*  things. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=621.86s)]
*  Let's talk about that a second. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=622.86s)]
*  Sora was pretty like, holy shit moment, right? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=624.86s)]
*  And someone is doing it right at OpenAI with ChatGPT and then Sora. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=629.42s)]
*  But I remember last year you told us it used to take 30 seconds to generate on stability [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=635.38s)]
*  a single image and then it was down to a second and you've advanced the technology orders [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=642.98s)]
*  magnitude since then. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=647.5799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so I think if we can put the thing up. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=648.86s)]
*  Put up the slide, stable image. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=651.8199999999999s)]
*  And then if we actually go to the next slide, talk about speed. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=656.54s)]
*  Should I click this? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=661.5799999999999s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=662.5799999999999s)]
*  Oh, we can click this to give an idea of where it's gone. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=663.5799999999999s)]
*  So image was kind of one of the things that kicked us off in 2022. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=665.6s)]
*  All of these images can be generated on the MacBook. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=668.9s)]
*  Just from description. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=673.02s)]
*  And now we've perfected text and other things. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=674.5s)]
*  But the next step after you can generate all these beautiful images is that you want to [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=677.38s)]
*  move to control. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=681.62s)]
*  So the models are just the first step. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=683.2800000000001s)]
*  You have to have ChatGPT and other things to make them useful. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=684.58s)]
*  But then you want to be able to take that guy and say upscale. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=687.02s)]
*  And that's all we said and upscaled him. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=689.5400000000001s)]
*  You want to replace the line with a cat and we can now do that real time. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=691.26s)]
*  Or tiger with a unicorn. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=695.1800000000001s)]
*  Or face background with a forest. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=697.02s)]
*  So all of this you can do pretty much real time. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=699.62s)]
*  Because if you look at the next slide from this. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=701.26s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=703.34s)]
*  I said it was 20 seconds to one second. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=704.34s)]
*  This is live real time. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=707.1800000000001s)]
*  You can just type and it automatically adjusts the cat. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=708.38s)]
*  It gives him a hat. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=710.58s)]
*  But then if you look at the optimization of that with the next slide. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=711.98s)]
*  Back when we missed it. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=716.3000000000001s)]
*  This one? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=717.3000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=718.3000000000001s)]
*  Well, we missed it. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=719.3000000000001s)]
*  We'll go back one slide. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=720.3000000000001s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=721.3000000000001s)]
*  With this process here, we're just releasing a new distillation model today. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=722.3000000000001s)]
*  We've got 200 cats with hats per second. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=725.22s)]
*  200 cats with hats per second. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=728.34s)]
*  So that's your speed of image generation. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=730.78s)]
*  That's a new unit of image generation. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=733.1s)]
*  50 milliseconds per inch. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=735.22s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=737.26s)]
*  Because there's not enough cats on the internet, right? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=738.26s)]
*  So we're going to add more cats to the internet. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=740.06s)]
*  Oh, five milliseconds. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=741.42s)]
*  Five milliseconds. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=742.42s)]
*  Five milliseconds, yeah. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=743.42s)]
*  But I think with the new chips that are coming and video is going to announce another one, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=744.42s)]
*  we'll get up towards 1,000 images per second. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=747.22s)]
*  So that's live video times 30. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=749.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=753.9s)]
*  And so OpenAI's innovation, there were two major things. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=755.06s)]
*  So it's a transformer architecture, the language models and diffusion that drive the media [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=758.46s)]
*  models. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=762.38s)]
*  They combine the two together. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=763.38s)]
*  So our new image model stable diffusion three, which is the best performing image model, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=764.38s)]
*  combines those together as well. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=767.62s)]
*  So if you go forward a few slides from here. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=768.62s)]
*  Next one. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=770.3000000000001s)]
*  Skip another one. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=771.3000000000001s)]
*  Another one. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=772.3000000000001s)]
*  That's the upscaling. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=773.3000000000001s)]
*  So you basically said upscale this image on the left and you get the image on the right. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=774.3000000000001s)]
*  We'll have that real time in a couple of years. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=779.98s)]
*  So your boxy video games will look a lot more realistic. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=781.62s)]
*  So just literally as you can take an old game and play it in surreal life. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=783.98s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=788.26s)]
*  But if you go to the next slide, these videos with our video model were all generated on [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=789.26s)]
*  a consumer graphics card with five gigabytes of VRAM. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=793.02s)]
*  So I mean, the point is this is in everybody's hands. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=797.02s)]
*  It's in everyone's hands. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=802.5s)]
*  And again, we haven't even optimized the data. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=803.5s)]
*  So in an hour, next slide, we're releasing the world's most advanced 3D model. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=805.7s)]
*  So all of these are generated just from descriptions. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=811.62s)]
*  And so the fastest version of this does it in one second. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=814.7800000000001s)]
*  So you can generate that dragon. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=817.26s)]
*  But then the next step is you'll be able to control every element, make its horns bigger, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=819.0200000000001s)]
*  make these adjustments. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=822.58s)]
*  So how long would that take for a normal creative person in kind of industry? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=823.94s)]
*  A huge amount of time. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=828.86s)]
*  But now it works on the edge and it works even faster in the cloud. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=830.22s)]
*  So a future here where you can be describing the video game you want created and it's [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=834.58s)]
*  generating all the characters and generating the play. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=841.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=844.06s)]
*  And so if you go back a few slides to that thing with all the nodes, I think this is [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=845.06s)]
*  an important thing. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=847.38s)]
*  Sorry, I didn't do the slides properly. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=848.38s)]
*  I think one of the things that we're having right now is this is a system we built called [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=851.26s)]
*  Comfy UI that's used by just about everyone now. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=855.26s)]
*  So you take the face, the pose, the dress, and then you have that output. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=858.38s)]
*  But if I share that image with you, it reconstructs the entire flow. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=863.78s)]
*  Because last year was the year of creation, models that create. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=867.3000000000001s)]
*  Then ChatGPT Comfy UI allowed you to control and compose them. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=870.26s)]
*  And the next bit is bringing that all together. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=874.3000000000001s)]
*  Because ChatGPT, all the knowledge that you build from writing your speech, you don't [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=876.1800000000001s)]
*  have files anymore. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=880.74s)]
*  You have flows with these models and assets there. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=881.74s)]
*  I think that's the next step because when you go beyond just spitting out ideas to be [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=884.6600000000001s)]
*  able to control them like that, that's a huge deal. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=889.38s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=892.98s)]
*  And you're announcing this in an hour. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=894.86s)]
*  The 3D model is releasing in an hour. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=896.74s)]
*  Open source to everyone. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=898.14s)]
*  Give it up for E-mod here. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=899.14s)]
*  You really have, I don't know if you're able to say this, I mean, you're driving revenue [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=900.14s)]
*  and su net profitability. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=913.14s)]
*  What's your financial? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=914.98s)]
*  I can't say that publicly. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=915.98s)]
*  You can't? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=916.98s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=917.98s)]
*  But it's going well. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=918.98s)]
*  We're ahead of full costs. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=919.98s)]
*  He told me backstage it was good. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=920.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=922.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=923.46s)]
*  Good. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=924.46s)]
*  Everybody, I want to take a short break from our episode to talk about a company that's [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=925.62s)]
*  very important to me and could actually save your life or the life of someone that you [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=928.86s)]
*  love. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=933.98s)]
*  The company is called Fountain Life. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=934.98s)]
*  And it's a company I started years ago with Tony Robbins and a group of very talented [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=935.98s)]
*  physicians. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=941.3000000000001s)]
*  You know, most of us don't actually know what's going on inside our body. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=942.3000000000001s)]
*  We're all optimists. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=946.58s)]
*  Until that day where you have a pain in your side, you go to the physician in the emergency [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=948.4200000000001s)]
*  room and they say, listen, I'm sorry to tell you this, but you have this stage three or [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=952.94s)]
*  four going on. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=956.74s)]
*  And you know, it didn't start that morning. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=958.1s)]
*  It probably was a problem that's been going on for some time, but because we never look, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=960.86s)]
*  we don't find out. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=966.4200000000001s)]
*  So what we built at Fountain Life was the world's most advanced diagnostic centers. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=967.94s)]
*  We have four across the US today and we're building 20 around the world. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=973.4000000000001s)]
*  These centers give you a full body MRI, a brain, a brain vasculature, an AI enabled [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=978.18s)]
*  coronary CT looking for soft plaque, dexa scan, a grail blood cancer test, a full executive [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=983.8199999999999s)]
*  blood workup. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=990.2199999999999s)]
*  It's the most advanced workup you'll ever receive. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=991.62s)]
*  150 gigabytes of data that then go to our AIs and our physicians to find any disease [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=994.9799999999999s)]
*  at the very beginning when it's solvable. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1001.78s)]
*  You're going to find out eventually. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1004.8599999999999s)]
*  You might as well find out when you can take action. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1006.78s)]
*  Fountain Life also has an entire side of therapeutics. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1009.14s)]
*  We look around the world for the most advanced therapeutics that can add 10, 20 healthy years [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1012.04s)]
*  to your life. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1015.9599999999999s)]
*  And we provide them to you at our centers. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1017.26s)]
*  So if this is of interest to you, please go and check it out. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1020.8199999999999s)]
*  Go to fountainlife.com backslash Peter. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1025.58s)]
*  When Tony and I wrote our New York Times bestseller Life Force, we had 30,000 people reached out [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1029.76s)]
*  to us for Fountain Life memberships. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1035.86s)]
*  You go to fountainlife.com backslash Peter, we'll put you to the top of the list. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1038.34s)]
*  Really it's something that is for me one of the most important things I offer my entire [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1043.86s)]
*  family, the CEOs of my companies, my friends. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1048.62s)]
*  It's a chance to really add decades onto our healthy lifespans. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1052.58s)]
*  Go to fountainlife.com backslash Peter. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1057.8999999999999s)]
*  It's one of the most important things I can offer to you as one of my listeners. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1060.62s)]
*  All right, let's go back to our episode. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1064.38s)]
*  I am curious about the idea of how far are we from having an AI that I can have a conversation [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1066.58s)]
*  with and say, I'd really like to create a new business that does this, this and this. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1074.74s)]
*  And just have that kind of brainstorm partner AI. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1080.98s)]
*  And it will do the incorporation. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1084.58s)]
*  It will write the code. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1087.42s)]
*  It will generate the marketing materials. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1088.98s)]
*  And it will be able to, we're all entrepreneurs here. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1092.34s)]
*  That's all we, find a problem, build a business. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1096.22s)]
*  Find a problem, build a business. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1099.4199999999998s)]
*  How far are we from that reality of an AI created, well, I'll come back to the second [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1101.3s)]
*  part in a minute, but an AI that can be your thought partner and really staff up a company? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1106.86s)]
*  I think it's already happening gradually and then maybe suddenly. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1113.8999999999999s)]
*  We have, I think companies will, these models are neural, they're neural networks. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1119.86s)]
*  And so I think the right way to think about it is that companies in the future will just [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1123.9399999999998s)]
*  be increasingly neural. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1126.58s)]
*  And there'll be more and more of the company and what used to be the departments of the [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1128.1399999999999s)]
*  company that are single models or swarms of models that are doing work. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1132.5s)]
*  I think it'll, at some point, probably very soon, we'll look back on 2024 and say, God, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1137.9799999999998s)]
*  do you remember when companies had like hundreds of people in the finance department doing [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1143.06s)]
*  accounts payable and just like transforming information from one form of text to another, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1147.46s)]
*  essentially in doing this coordination. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1154.02s)]
*  And so I think you will have some form of both existing companies that just adopt more [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1156.78s)]
*  and more AI because it gives them advantages. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1162.06s)]
*  It makes them more efficient. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1164.42s)]
*  Maybe it gives them better customer service. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1165.9s)]
*  People enjoy the responsiveness, intelligence, politeness, clarity, et cetera, of the AI [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1168.14s)]
*  counterparty. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1173.74s)]
*  You'll also have new companies that will be AI native, started from scratch, neural from [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1176.14s)]
*  the beginning. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1180.5800000000002s)]
*  So some people may remember when Instagram was acquired by Facebook for a billion dollars, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1181.5800000000002s)]
*  everyone was just marveling at the fact that a small company- [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1187.66s)]
*  Thirteen employees. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1191.1000000000001s)]
*  Thirteen people could be worth a billion dollars. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1192.1000000000001s)]
*  How is that possible? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1194.38s)]
*  And the joke was, gosh, could you ever get down to a one person company that's worth [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1195.9s)]
*  a billion dollars? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1200.8200000000002s)]
*  And I thought, well, like, this is clearly going to happen. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1201.82s)]
*  Maybe eventually a zero person company. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1204.22s)]
*  So we talked about this getting ready and I said, when are we going to have a scenario [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1206.5s)]
*  where a government, and we have some governance in the room here, says we're going to create [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1210.3s)]
*  a new regulation that allows an AI to incorporate on its own in our jurisdiction. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1216.9399999999998s)]
*  I think it's a winning scenario because all of a sudden the AI incorporates, you get [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1224.6599999999999s)]
*  the tax base and every AI incorporated company will move there. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1229.8999999999999s)]
*  I think Wyoming's done that. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1234.3s)]
*  What's that? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1235.9799999999998s)]
*  Wyoming's done that. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1236.9799999999998s)]
*  They have a new structure called a DUNA for a decentralized autonomous organization. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1237.9799999999998s)]
*  I'm sorry, who has? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1240.8999999999999s)]
*  Wyoming. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1242.06s)]
*  Wyoming. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1243.06s)]
*  Of all places. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1244.06s)]
*  Yeah, we have some Wyoming fans here in the audience. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1245.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1246.74s)]
*  So technically that could happen today. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1247.74s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1250.26s)]
*  I mean, I do think that that is a... [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1252.66s)]
*  So the speed of wealth creation. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1255.18s)]
*  Let's talk about what are the wow moments that might be possible in the next year. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1262.14s)]
*  What are some crazy wow moments that you might see? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1266.1s)]
*  I think one of the most important things is the accuracy and then these long context windows. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1269.94s)]
*  Explain what the long context window is again. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1275.94s)]
*  So you're absorbing information right now and it's quite high definition because you [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1277.5s)]
*  can see everything here and other stuff but you're still writing it down. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1281.14s)]
*  And the reason our organizations get big is because text is a lossy transmission format. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1285.0200000000002s)]
*  We lose so much context. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1289.7s)]
*  The final PDF loses all of that stuff. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1290.7s)]
*  Now with the new Google models, NAT has some amazing companies in this space as well. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1293.42s)]
*  You can upload hundreds of thousands of words, thousands of documents, and the AI can interpret [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1297.7s)]
*  them all at once. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1303.26s)]
*  There doesn't need to be trained on it. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1304.26s)]
*  So you can upload all of your ideas and say build a business based on this and it will [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1306.16s)]
*  do that. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1310.0600000000002s)]
*  Or you can upload a whole bunch of movies and then tell it to write a script that incorporates [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1311.98s)]
*  all of that and it will do that inference time. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1316.62s)]
*  But again, it's something superhuman. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1318.58s)]
*  But we all have these massive repositories of all these ideas we've had. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1321.22s)]
*  Being able to dump that now and then the AI without having to be trained, spit back answers, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1326.1s)]
*  ideas, and things like that I think is a really huge step along with that composition step [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1330.78s)]
*  that I've discussed before. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1335.46s)]
*  Yeah I totally agree with that. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1338.3s)]
*  I think there will be a couple things coming probably pretty soon. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1339.74s)]
*  It's hard to predict exact timelines on these things. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1343.5s)]
*  Sometimes things happen faster than you expect and sometimes a little slower. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1347.34s)]
*  But one of the clearly amazing, clearly possible now products to build is a voice to voice [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1349.98s)]
*  model that's indistinguishable from talking to a human maybe for a conversation of up [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1355.9s)]
*  to a couple minutes. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1360.82s)]
*  What happens after a couple of minutes? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1362.9s)]
*  Well maybe you can kind of just tell somehow that it's not quite human after a couple of [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1364.54s)]
*  minutes. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1369.22s)]
*  I'm setting a milestone that I think is achievable this year. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1370.22s)]
*  Maybe if you can do two minutes you can do 12 minutes. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1373.9s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1376.1000000000001s)]
*  But yeah, you know, it's actually about all the technologies there, it all just has to [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1378.22s)]
*  be integrated. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1383.94s)]
*  And so you need the sort of the ability to recognize speech is there, the ability to [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1384.94s)]
*  interpret it with a language model and generate responses is there, and then the ability to [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1388.18s)]
*  turn that text into incredibly realistic voices there. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1391.94s)]
*  And kind of putting that all together into a package that has very low latency that's [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1396.14s)]
*  talking the way we talk where you can kind of interrupt me and maybe there's an avatar [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1400.42s)]
*  that's giving you this human-like, I mean Aristotle was very impressive but I knew that [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1404.3400000000001s)]
*  that was not a real person. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1408.26s)]
*  And so I think we could. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1410.0600000000002s)]
*  He was a real person. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1411.94s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1413.46s)]
*  And then I think the other thing that's a very big deal is this idea of autonomy and [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1414.94s)]
*  agents. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1419.8200000000002s)]
*  There's been a lot of talk of it with AI over the last year. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1420.8200000000002s)]
*  Today these things are not agents, they're tools, they're call and response. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1424.9s)]
*  You go to chat GBT, you type something, you hit enter, you watch the response kind of [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1427.7800000000002s)]
*  stream back. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1431.7s)]
*  And I think what people don't necessarily understand is that when these language models [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1433.3200000000002s)]
*  are responding to you, it's almost like a rap battle. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1437.3400000000001s)]
*  They have a fixed amount of time to generate each word. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1440.3000000000002s)]
*  And so they can't sort of sit there and ponder for a minute, you know, what they're going [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1443.66s)]
*  to say, they have to talk to a metronome. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1447.0400000000002s)]
*  So that's why when you see the words that they're writing out, that's not like they've [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1451.32s)]
*  thought about it a lot and then you see the words. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1455.3999999999999s)]
*  It's actually the thinking is happening during the output. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1459.04s)]
*  Would you say that's how a human does it too? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1462.0s)]
*  I often do that. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1464.8s)]
*  I mean a lot of times I'm really pissed off at what came out of my mouth because I didn't [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1465.8s)]
*  think about it in advance. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1469.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I think so. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1470.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean sometimes you have a conversation with a smart friend and just forming the words [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1471.3999999999999s)]
*  to respond you have a better idea. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1474.8799999999999s)]
*  So I think we definitely do that too. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1477.12s)]
*  But the agent, the autonomy is about kind of increasing the unit of work you can trust [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1480.04s)]
*  the AI to do without making a mistake. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1485.72s)]
*  So right now you can ask it one question, get a response, you interpret it, you figure [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1488.08s)]
*  out the next thing. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1491.48s)]
*  But what if it could go do 10 or 100 steps? [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1492.48s)]
*  You're talking about an AI business. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1494.64s)]
*  You know, do you trust it to come up with the title of the blog post that you're going [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1496.76s)]
*  to post or do you trust it to actually come up with the whole idea of the marketing campaign, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1501.0s)]
*  right? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1505.96s)]
*  Come up with a strategy for how to execute it, all of the content it's going to generate, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1507.0s)]
*  the partners it will reach out to and negotiate advertising or whatever it's going to do, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1511.16s)]
*  have those conversations to multi-step successfully all the way to like measuring its results [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1516.52s)]
*  without supervision. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1521.64s)]
*  And I think that agency thing, we're starting to see it in programming. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1522.64s)]
*  There was a very impressive demo a week or two ago of a company called Cognition that [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1525.8400000000001s)]
*  I think it was maybe it was arguably the first really impressive demo of working agents [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1531.6399999999999s)]
*  in AI and they did it with GPT-4. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1538.52s)]
*  So not with a new brand new model. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1542.1599999999999s)]
*  They did it by being very clever about the way they squeeze and distill the intelligence [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1544.6s)]
*  out of GPT-4 by repeatedly calling it and analyzing and evaluating its results and choosing [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1548.9199999999998s)]
*  the best ones. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1554.6s)]
*  So sort of going from rap battle to like draft and redraft and sort of think and ponder about [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1555.6s)]
*  it a little bit harder mode. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1560.76s)]
*  And it can do hundreds of steps in programming successfully. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1562.8400000000001s)]
*  I was going to ask you one quick question then please jump into that. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1566.96s)]
*  How far out can you imagine right now? [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1571.8400000000001s)]
*  About three years. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1575.6000000000001s)]
*  Three years is a max. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1576.92s)]
*  How about you, Nate? [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1577.92s)]
*  Well you can dream. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1581.0s)]
*  You can dream. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1583.64s)]
*  So I actually the thing I find easier is to think about the long term because [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1585.0s)]
*  The asymptote of where we're [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1590.72s)]
*  Yeah and that's the key question of our time is the asymptote. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1594.28s)]
*  It's like we know this is going to get better. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1598.36s)]
*  When does it slow down and what's the shape of the curve to get there? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1601.24s)]
*  You mind if I cut you off? [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1604.88s)]
*  Apologies. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1605.88s)]
*  No it's fine. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1606.88s)]
*  I think probably the thing to look forward to is the last couple of years. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1607.88s)]
*  The first year was about the technology and the breakthroughs and the research. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1612.0s)]
*  Last year was about the models. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1616.56s)]
*  Next year going forward no one gives a damn about the models. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1618.88s)]
*  It's all about what you can do with the models bringing them together because the models [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1621.76s)]
*  have satisfied. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1624.52s)]
*  They've got good enough, fast enough and cheap enough. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1626.08s)]
*  They will get even better and there's probably two orders of magnitude improvements still [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1628.24s)]
*  in the speed and reliability of the model. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1633.28s)]
*  But this will really become about the stories of the next year will be about we use this [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1635.88s)]
*  model to do this and it was amazing. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1639.92s)]
*  So I think that's one of the things to look at and that's what Nat said about tying them [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1644.7600000000002s)]
*  all together. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1648.96s)]
*  You've got the ingredients now. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1649.96s)]
*  What are the recipes we're going to make? [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1651.68s)]
*  Very quickly capital and regulation. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1653.18s)]
*  I was in a conversation with the CEO of one of the major AI companies and he was saying [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1655.5600000000002s)]
*  he's raising three billion and I said you know I have a venture fund. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1663.0400000000002s)]
*  I said great and he said what's your minimum and he said probably 100 million. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1667.1999999999998s)]
*  I said okay well that's out of my ballpark. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1671.8799999999999s)]
*  And how quick do you think you're going to raise it? [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1676.76s)]
*  He goes next month. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1678.9599999999998s)]
*  There is a lot of capital flowing in. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1680.84s)]
*  Have you ever seen a capital rush faster than this? [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1685.12s)]
*  No. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1690.7199999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1691.7199999999998s)]
*  I think there are a couple of comparisons you can look at. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1692.7199999999998s)]
*  I think the railways when railway infrastructure was being laid in the UK I think it was some [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1696.68s)]
*  double digit percent of GDP investment. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1703.28s)]
*  I think the solar explosion that's happening right now is actually pretty amazing. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1706.48s)]
*  It's something like half a point of global GDP is being invested in solar. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1709.72s)]
*  So those are pretty big. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1715.22s)]
*  We're nowhere near that yet with AI and so I actually think if AI keeps working which [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1717.6000000000001s)]
*  it seems like it will. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1724.52s)]
*  You should expect the future to look more like that railway or solar situation where [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1727.16s)]
*  there's you're measuring the investment in intelligence because it's so valuable. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1731.48s)]
*  Intelligence AI is intelligence. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1735.72s)]
*  Intelligence is power. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1737.4s)]
*  Power is valuable. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1739.0s)]
*  It's power over nature. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1740.0s)]
*  It's power over others. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1741.0s)]
*  And so you'll probably measure the amount of investment in it in points of global GDP [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1742.96s)]
*  and whether that happens in two years or 10 years I'm not sure but it seems likely. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1747.92s)]
*  I mean to put this in context less money has been spent on private AI companies than the [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1752.64s)]
*  Los Angeles San Francisco railway that hasn't started yet. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1757.64s)]
*  There you go. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1761.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1762.0s)]
*  But that's almost done I heard. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1763.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1764.56s)]
*  Fantastic. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1765.56s)]
*  How many have started? [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1766.56s)]
*  We rode down on it. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1767.56s)]
*  The AI right now is an infrastructure but it should be. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1768.56s)]
*  Talk about your vision there because I find it very powerful. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1772.72s)]
*  Your vision there in education, in health. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1776.4s)]
*  Talk to me. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1779.64s)]
*  We're using the next generation human operating system because these AIs extend our capabilities. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1780.72s)]
*  And again you'll need the AIs that are open and the ones that are proprietary to have [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1785.0800000000002s)]
*  the best outcome for everyone. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1788.0s)]
*  Because all of our companies here are all information systems and we've seen how better [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1789.92s)]
*  it can be. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1793.3600000000001s)]
*  So the total amount of spending in this will be trillions of dollars. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1794.6000000000001s)]
*  We spent a trillion dollars on 5G. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1797.6000000000001s)]
*  Is AI more impactful than 5G? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1799.96s)]
*  Of course it is. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1801.5200000000002s)]
*  Should it be infrastructure? [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1803.16s)]
*  Of course it should be. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1804.24s)]
*  Should the data be transparent? [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1805.8400000000001s)]
*  Of course it should be because you need to know how our railways are made. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1807.1200000000001s)]
*  The information knowledge superhighway of the future. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1809.84s)]
*  Right now it's a few companies doing this but we need standards around it and we need [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1812.96s)]
*  the expansion and again every country will invest in this. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1816.9199999999998s)]
*  Every company will invest in this. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1819.84s)]
*  Is anyone here who runs a company not investing in this? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1821.24s)]
*  In some way. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1825.04s)]
*  At least your time, right? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1826.04s)]
*  Yeah, multiplied by every company in the world. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1827.04s)]
*  So where are we percentage wise at the investment in AI? [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1828.84s)]
*  Are we at a fraction of 1% still? [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1833.48s)]
*  I would say so, yes. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1835.24s)]
*  How about you, Nate? [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1836.24s)]
*  Seems likely. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1837.24s)]
*  So a lot of upside still opportunity. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1838.28s)]
*  It is crazy though. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1841.2s)]
*  I saw a tweet the other day. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1842.2s)]
*  I mean I live through dot com and all these little tech bubbles and I saw a tweet the [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1843.4s)]
*  other day from someone that said, if you don't secure equity in an AI startup now then your [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1851.2s)]
*  children will be chattel slaves for the machine god for all eternity. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1856.52s)]
*  And I remember thinking, I don't remember anyone saying that during dot com. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1862.1200000000001s)]
*  Then you switched around and bought some more GPs, right? [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1867.1200000000001s)]
*  This is somehow a little bit more extreme than the prior bubbles. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1868.92s)]
*  So I mean look, I think web 3 kind of received a lot without any results whereas now you're [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1872.76s)]
*  seeing impact here. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1878.2s)]
*  But again, you multiply this by the number of people it affects, the value created. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1880.0s)]
*  It's insane because it will go all to subtraction. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1884.16s)]
*  You've had the base, the foundations, now the base, now you're building the houses, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1886.5600000000002s)]
*  you're building a whole ecosystem around this. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1890.5600000000002s)]
*  And the transformation that that has and the amount of capital is bigger than anything [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1892.52s)]
*  we've seen. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1896.8799999999999s)]
*  Let me ask the question we're going to be debating today on the asymptote. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1897.8799999999999s)]
*  How concerned are you about digital super intelligence? [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1902.72s)]
*  I'm defining this for a purpose of conversation as AI a billion fold more advanced than the [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1906.28s)]
*  human being. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1912.76s)]
*  How do you think about that? [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1916.72s)]
*  What's your position in that debate? [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1918.2s)]
*  I can kick off. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1922.56s)]
*  My belief is that humans can break the atom or we can go to Mars. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1923.8s)]
*  And so my vision is every single nation, person, company, country, culture has their own AI, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1929.92s)]
*  data sets and self-sovereign. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1934.92s)]
*  Needs to figure out the governance of this because it's important. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1935.92s)]
*  And then that AI is our collective intelligence, is the human colossus. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1939.08s)]
*  So it isn't controlled by any one individual, isn't embodied like that. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1943.24s)]
*  But again, it's amplifying all of us and it's solving every single problem that we can have. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1946.4s)]
*  I think that's a positive version of the future. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1950.52s)]
*  I think it seems really likely that, I mean, it seems undoubtable to me actually that intelligence [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1953.96s)]
*  is just a material process like muscle strength. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1960.68s)]
*  We have organs called muscles. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1964.2s)]
*  We use them to move. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1966.0s)]
*  We have an organ called the brain and we use it to think. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1967.0s)]
*  And so if you look at, if you just sort of ask what that means, well, we've managed to [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1971.96s)]
*  exceed muscle strength with artificial machines, with machines hundreds of years ago. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1977.44s)]
*  And we're going to do that with brains too. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1984.84s)]
*  We're going to have artificial minds that are much more powerful than ours. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1988.92s)]
*  And it's almost like you just have to be an AI doubter not to believe that or you have [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1994.24s)]
*  to not believe in human ingenuity. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=1999.44s)]
*  All the most brilliant people in the world are now working on this. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2001.48s)]
*  There's a huge amount of capital going into it and in a way we've just started. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2006.16s)]
*  And so the idea that it wouldn't improve seems hard to believe. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2010.1200000000001s)]
*  Did you know that your microbiome is composed of trillions of bacteria, viruses and microbes [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2013.44s)]
*  and that they play a critical role in your health? [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2019.16s)]
*  Research has increasingly shown that microbiomes impact not just digestion, but a wide range [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2021.7600000000002s)]

*  systems to outrun the horse, that was a local phenomenon. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2169.52s)]
*  But now this is a global phenomenon because my bits are reaching around the world. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2174.8s)]
*  When you say, yeah, you can do my marketing, do my marketing campaigns, you can do my scientific [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2180.72s)]
*  analysis, you can do everything, and I keep on hearing that is not 10 years from now, [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2184.96s)]
*  not five years from now, but that's a three-year scenario. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2191.8s)]
*  I don't know how to think about that. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2194.16s)]
*  I think the pace of change is going to be very high. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2198.84s)]
*  Global GDP growth has been in the 2% range and we have a society and civilization that's [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2205.32s)]
*  able to adapt to that amount of change per year, mostly, not entirely. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2211.7200000000003s)]
*  It's been a little bit higher before. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2216.7200000000003s)]
*  Maybe it's going to be much higher very soon. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2219.32s)]
*  There's a huge spread of outcomes that come from that. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2224.52s)]
*  Even if you don't have the extermination scenarios, the extinction scenarios in mind, I think [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2228.64s)]
*  you actually should have other scenarios in mind. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2236.0s)]
*  What does it mean to be human? [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2237.68s)]
*  Is the economy human-dominated 10 years from now or 15? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2240.16s)]
*  Where are decisions made and who makes them? [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2244.52s)]
*  This vision of sovereign AIs, it's a new level of potentially cooperation and competition [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2248.64s)]
*  between countries and sources of this kind of power. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2257.12s)]
*  A lot of change is coming. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2262.16s)]
*  We went through this before. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2265.88s)]
*  We had these five big inventions of the 1880s through the 1920s. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2266.92s)]
*  That was a wild time of transformation. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2271.92s)]
*  People who grew up with horse carts ended up riding on jet planes. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2275.48s)]
*  We're going to have at least, probably much more than that amount of change happen this [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2280.96s)]
*  time. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2284.92s)]
*  Let me go to you, Emad, next. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2285.92s)]
*  When you were about to go after this to part two of that tool, I want you to be thinking [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2287.32s)]
*  about how can AI help you solve the challenges you listed? [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2292.72s)]
*  How will AI threaten the dominant positions or the strengths that you have? [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2298.64s)]
*  How will AI this year help you meet your 2024 goals? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2305.2s)]
*  That's the goal to putting it to use. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2310.56s)]
*  Emad, do you want to comment on that? [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2312.2s)]
*  I want to also talk about medicine. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2313.96s)]
*  You're dedicated to using AI models to solve autism and cancer and death or let's just [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2316.6s)]
*  say sickness. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2325.04s)]
*  Sickness. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2327.0s)]
*  I just had a thought actually. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2330.0s)]
*  We had Steve Jobs a little bit earlier. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2331.0s)]
*  Maybe the AI is jet planes for the mind. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2332.84s)]
*  There you go. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2334.96s)]
*  The impact here, there's a sociological impact. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2338.96s)]
*  We can extrapolate forwards, but an ASI is just something we can't think. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2341.2s)]
*  If you've got two infinite supply of graduates, what do the existing graduates do? [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2345.52s)]
*  If the floor is raised, you don't need to hire as much. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2351.94s)]
*  You become more efficient. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2353.92s)]
*  What are the new jobs of the future in a knowledge-based economy? [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2355.8s)]
*  We have to think about that because as Nat alluded to, it's like slowly, slowly, then [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2357.8s)]
*  all at once like a turkey. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2362.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, Thanksgiving. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2364.44s)]
*  I think if you look at this though, there's the negative side, but then there's a positive [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2366.4s)]
*  side. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2369.12s)]
*  I think I mentioned last year, Google's MedPal model outperforms human doctors in medical [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2370.12s)]
*  diagnosis accuracy, but also empathy. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2375.08s)]
*  We have medical models like that. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2377.64s)]
*  Anyone here who's had someone who's had multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's, autism, something [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2380.08s)]
*  like that, you don't have comprehensive authority to up to date knowledge and nobody to guide [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2384.0s)]
*  you through that process and you lose agency. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2388.08s)]
*  Well, guess what? [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2390.2s)]
*  We will make open source models and they will be available to everyone and you'll never [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2392.12s)]
*  be alone again through that. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2395.44s)]
*  And then they'll be used for diagnosis and organizing all the knowledge here. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2397.12s)]
*  Describe that a little bit more so people can feel what that feels like. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2400.2400000000002s)]
*  It means again, anyone's experienced that. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2403.86s)]
*  Someone comes to you and says, you have a diagnosis of Alzheimer's for your father or [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2406.36s)]
*  autism for your child. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2409.96s)]
*  You lose agency because you're like, what now? [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2411.92s)]
*  There's no cure, there's no treatment. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2413.8s)]
*  Where do I even go for information? [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2415.2000000000003s)]
*  A lot of our stuff is a coordination issue. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2417.28s)]
*  Whereas if we have a specialized medical model for that topic and retrieval augmentation [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2419.8s)]
*  and tie it into all these systems, you can have all that knowledge at your fingertips [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2424.52s)]
*  and it can help guide you empathetically through that. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2428.84s)]
*  It can literally talk to you. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2431.64s)]
*  It can connect you with other people going through the same process. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2433.5s)]
*  And then the next step is it can organize all the knowledge in this area because there's [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2436.4s)]
*  so many promising treatments. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2439.48s)]
*  How does anyone here find out all the treatments about autism or cancer? [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2441.8s)]
*  There used to be patients like me, but it hasn't survived. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2444.6800000000003s)]
*  But this supercharges that. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2447.6800000000003s)]
*  And then you do that once and it's infrastructure for the 50% of people around the world that [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2449.76s)]
*  will have a diagnosis of cancer. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2454.92s)]
*  And again, you've transformed it because there will always be someone with every single person [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2457.14s)]
*  that can connect them to the right information at the right time. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2460.7200000000003s)]
*  So this is a positive view of the future and that creates boundless new potential in terms [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2463.4s)]
*  of both addressing our health, but science. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2467.7599999999998s)]
*  And again, most of our science is based on files, a PDF, and we throw away all the stuff [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2471.48s)]
*  that doesn't work. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2476.8399999999997s)]
*  If you look at that knowledge flow of that image with the different things, and again, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2478.7999999999997s)]
*  if I drag and send you that image, it'll reconstruct the whole flow. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2482.2799999999997s)]
*  I think most of our things will go from files to flows so we can remix our knowledge so [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2484.9599999999996s)]
*  that we can find out what works and what doesn't work and that's how we get breakthroughs. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2489.8399999999997s)]
*  And is it true that most of the large language models were built on top of all the social [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2492.92s)]
*  media, Facebook, websites and so forth, but not crawling science magazines and most of [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2498.6800000000003s)]
*  the scientific databases out there? [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2505.32s)]
*  Science was a part of it, but again, what we did is big compute was a substitute for [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2507.92s)]
*  bad data. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2511.4s)]
*  It was like cooking a steak for too long. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2512.4s)]
*  Now we see that high quality data is even better, but we're only understanding what [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2515.1200000000003s)]
*  high quality means. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2518.32s)]
*  And this is why we need specialized models which are transparent, especially for things [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2519.8s)]
*  that affect things like health, education and others. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2523.76s)]
*  So I think data set transparency will be a big tool and this goes to Nat's point about [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2527.48s)]
*  interpretability as well. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2530.56s)]
*  You had given the example of archival earlier, right? [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2532.36s)]
*  Science, one of the things that I think is amazing is the potential for these AIs to [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2537.76s)]
*  help us discover new science beyond interpolation or extrapolation, new laws of physics, new [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2545.04s)]
*  understandings of fundamental biology and chemistry. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2553.2000000000003s)]
*  Do you think that is possible? [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2558.6s)]
*  When are we going to see that? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2561.4s)]
*  And speak one second to the Vesuvius challenge that you... [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2562.52s)]
*  Oh, sure. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2565.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2566.04s)]
*  I think definitely they will. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2567.04s)]
*  Which by the way, for me is like the most exciting thing. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2569.0s)]
*  If you can unleash these AI models and say, go and create room temperature superconductors, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2571.04s)]
*  go and create life extension processes. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2576.7599999999998s)]
*  So there's in biology, especially biology, there's this sort of analogy that's been put [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2580.7599999999998s)]
*  out there that the language of physics was mathematics. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2585.36s)]
*  The language of biology might be machine learning because you're dealing with enormously complex [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2590.04s)]
*  systems. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2593.96s)]
*  Machine learning is great at sort of understanding those. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2594.96s)]
*  And so the potential for AI to transform biology is enormous. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2597.44s)]
*  I think it's all in the very earliest stages right now. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2600.52s)]
*  And we have not yet had the kind of GPT-3, let alone the chat GPT moment for biology [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2604.44s)]
*  and AI. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2609.84s)]
*  I think it'll come soon. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2610.84s)]
*  Since Google is our sponsor, I'm going to say the Gemini moment. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2611.84s)]
*  There you go. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2613.56s)]
*  The Gemini moment hasn't occurred yet. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2614.56s)]
*  Is it the Bard moment maybe? [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2616.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2617.36s)]
*  But it's coming. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2618.36s)]
*  And I'm involved with some companies that are training enormous models to help synthesize [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2619.36s)]
*  and design proteins. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2624.92s)]
*  There are a few great efforts out there to do this. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2626.56s)]
*  And the capabilities that are popping out of these things are incredible. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2629.52s)]
*  The ability to describe a target, describe a structure, and just have it produce a sequence [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2634.44s)]
*  of amino acids that you can then synthesize and test in the lab for safety and efficacy. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2640.02s)]
*  It can short circuit a huge part of this sort of cognitive work and experimental work that's [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2645.0s)]
*  been necessary historically for drug design. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2651.7999999999997s)]
*  And so I think that's one thing. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2654.62s)]
*  I think another thing is there will be a surge of new discoveries that happen as AI [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2656.04s)]
*  digests all the existing scientific literature. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2663.32s)]
*  And so there's a whole area of study, which is meta-analysis, where people will study [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2666.48s)]
*  across papers to find connections and correlations across existing research that haven't been [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2671.08s)]
*  noticed. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2675.96s)]
*  I'm bubbling with excitement on that notion and that idea. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2676.96s)]
*  So I have a friend, Shana Swan. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2682.36s)]
*  She's a scientist at Berkeley and does a bunch of research on environmental toxins. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2686.44s)]
*  She spent two years running one meta-analysis that I'm now working with her and trying to [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2691.6800000000003s)]
*  support her in the effort to use AI to automate this. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2696.6400000000003s)]
*  And in theory, with these long context windows, this could potentially happen in minutes. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2699.76s)]
*  And so I think new discoveries will pop out of that immediately. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2704.2200000000003s)]
*  Just because we're short on time, I'm going to say you found Mount Vesuvius after the [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2708.32s)]
*  eruption buried a number of parchment scrolls that were, if you imagine, buried under all [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2712.92s)]
*  of the ashes and so forth. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2720.0800000000004s)]
*  You took some of those scrolls, you x-rayed them, gathered the x-rayed data from those [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2722.78s)]
*  scrolls and then you ran an order of a million dollar Vesuvius challenge, like an X-Prize. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2727.7200000000003s)]
*  And the winner solved it. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2736.12s)]
*  It worked, yeah. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2738.44s)]
*  No, it's true. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2739.44s)]
*  So yeah, 2,000 years ago, Mount Vesuvius erupts. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2740.44s)]
*  It buried the town of Herculaneum under 65 feet of ash and mud. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2742.4s)]
*  And then in the 1700s, some farmers digging a well found the villa at 65 feet down. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2747.12s)]
*  And then later during these tunneling excursions, people kept running into these little chunks [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2752.36s)]
*  of charcoal. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2756.6s)]
*  They didn't know what they were. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2757.6s)]
*  They turned out to be carbonized papyrus scrolls that were not openable physically. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2758.6s)]
*  They just sort of turned to dust in your hands when you opened them. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2762.7999999999997s)]
*  They've been stored in a library in Naples for years. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2765.28s)]
*  And we used a particle accelerator to scan them at super high resolution. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2768.36s)]
*  But then we needed to use AI and machine learning to unroll them. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2772.32s)]
*  They're so badly distorted by... [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2776.7200000000003s)]
*  How cool is that? [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2779.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2780.2000000000003s)]
*  Iman, I want you to close us out here with what you're most excited about going forward. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2781.2000000000003s)]
*  What's a vision of the world in the next one to three years that you want people to take [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2793.16s)]
*  away from here? [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2797.3999999999996s)]
*  I think this AI is augmenting, not replacing. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2799.48s)]
*  And so you see what kind of Nat said. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2802.7999999999997s)]
*  And I look how creatives use it. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2805.0s)]
*  AI can't do art. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2806.7999999999997s)]
*  It can do content right now. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2807.7999999999997s)]
*  But you can use it to riff and jam with so you can flow more often. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2808.7999999999997s)]
*  So the thing I'm most excited about is its impact upon education science over the coming [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2812.16s)]
*  years because everyone will have access to all the knowledge that amplifies them. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2816.7599999999998s)]
*  I think things like creativity are also great because it's great to create. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2821.48s)]
*  But realistically, again, every single person in this room will just have access. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2825.52s)]
*  This is the worst it will ever be. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2829.72s)]
*  That's so important. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2832.2s)]
*  This is the worst AI will ever be. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2833.2s)]
*  And the lowest Bitcoin will ever be too. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2835.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2838.52s)]
*  And then view it amplifying yourself. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2839.52s)]
*  And there's nothing you can't achieve with this, I think. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2841.76s)]
*  People are sitting down here with goals for the year, objectives they want to achieve. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2848.9s)]
*  What is your top piece of advice for the CEO, entrepreneur, philanthropist here that has [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2856.6600000000003s)]
*  like, oh man, I'm trying to do more and more. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2862.46s)]
*  What should they think about? [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2865.36s)]
*  Well I think what's happening or what's about to happen is sort of like we've just discovered [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2867.86s)]
*  a new continent with 100 billion people on it and they're willing to work for free for [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2872.62s)]
*  us and you should probably factor that into your plans over the next few years because [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2878.54s)]
*  your competitors will. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2887.86s)]
*  Because it will benefit you enormously at home, at work, and your family. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2890.2799999999997s)]
*  We just discovered a new continent with 100 million brilliant workers willing to work. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2894.06s)]
*  100 billion. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2898.1s)]
*  100%? [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2899.1s)]
*  They're going to outnumber us. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2900.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2901.1s)]
*  100 billion. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2902.1s)]
*  And they'll work for a few watts of power. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2903.1s)]
*  So this is the good scenario and I think it's very likely. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2906.7799999999997s)]
*  I think this is sort of like being an internet native, you want to be an AI native and you [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2911.22s)]
*  want to spend time using this stuff and not looking for the problems but looking for the [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2915.58s)]
*  value and what's it good at, what's it not good at, how do you interact with it. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2920.58s)]
*  It's amazing to see people use stable diffusion, for example. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2924.2999999999997s)]
*  You've improved it so much over time but there's a skill to being good at interacting with [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2928.3799999999997s)]
*  these models and partnering with them and so I think we all have an advantage just to [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2934.3s)]
*  get that hands on ourselves. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2939.34s)]
*  Imagine being CEO of a company when electrification was happening and obviously every company [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2941.5s)]
*  should electrify and then not doing it in your own home. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2949.34s)]
*  That would be strange. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2954.46s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2955.46s)]
*  Imad, you're going to be with us for the next few days. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2956.46s)]
*  So thank you so much for that. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2959.7000000000003s)]
*  Nate, it's a pleasure to get to know you. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2961.42s)]
*  Thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2963.66s)]
*  Let's give it up for Nate and Imad. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtDDPT1gZQ&t=2965.18s)]
