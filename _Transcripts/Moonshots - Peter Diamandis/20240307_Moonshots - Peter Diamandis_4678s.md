# Bitcoin Surge, AI Job Loss,  & 2024 AGI Predictions w/ Salim Ismail | EP #89
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [March 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E)
*  Everybody, Peter here with Moonshots and WTF just happened this week in technology with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=0.0s)]
*  Celine Miss Mayel. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4.64s)]
*  You know, I'm constantly saying I don't watch the news, but this is the news I do watch. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=5.64s)]
*  It's what's happening technology and a lot's just happened this week. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=11.16s)]
*  So strap in, get ready and let's jump in. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=14.44s)]
*  There's about 500 trillion worth of wealth in the world and I don't see why Bitcoin can't [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=17.92s)]
*  represent more and more of that. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=22.76s)]
*  The Bitcoin breakout. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=24.44s)]
*  It's boom today. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=25.44s)]
*  Boom today. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=26.6s)]
*  Bitcoin crosses a new all time high. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=27.6s)]
*  By any measure, these are the most successful ETF launches of all time. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=29.76s)]
*  This is likely to go much, much higher. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=33.24s)]
*  I think we're just at the beginning of this explosion. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=35.28s)]
*  Everybody, Peter here. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  Welcome to Moonshots. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  I'm here with the amazing Celine Miss Mayel and this is WTF Just Happened in Tech This [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  Week. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=51.2s)]
*  Salim, so we've got a lawsuit between Elon and OpenAI. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=52.28s)]
*  You know, I don't know about you, but I think we're going to spend more on legal bills than [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=57.64s)]
*  we should be. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=63.2s)]
*  And we should be spending it on tech instead. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=64.2s)]
*  So as much as I think Elon has every right to sue, I think that, you know, he should [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=66.98s)]
*  have taken action a lot sooner than he actually is doing right now. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=74.32000000000001s)]
*  What do you think about it? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I kind of take his side a bit on this. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  He put what, 50 or 100 million into OpenAI to create open, truly open and safe AI. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=81.28s)]
*  And it's gone 180 degrees the other direction. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=89.28s)]
*  So if he's feeling miffed, I think he has every right to be. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=92.24s)]
*  My challenge, my, listen, I agree with it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=95.6s)]
*  It's neither open nor is it a nonprofit. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=98.72s)]
*  And that was the intention. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=103.11999999999999s)]
*  But my question is, why is he taking action now? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=105.91999999999999s)]
*  Why didn't he take action when it occurred three years ago or whenever it happened? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=109.2s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  I think maybe he just got, you know, his anger tends to build up over time. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  Timing of his kind of actions is never quite a perfect fit with what's actually going on. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=122.28s)]
*  I think the ship has sailed, as you said, but I like, I'm, if you've spent a lot of [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=129.04s)]
*  time and effort helping build something and then they went totally the opposite way, you'd [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=136.48s)]
*  be feeling pretty miffed if you were him. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  So I totally understand the sentiment. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=143.56s)]
*  I agree. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=145.67999999999998s)]
*  I mean, I love the articles are coming out saying, actually, the reason Elon is doing [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=146.67999999999998s)]
*  this is he wants to know what Elia saw when they fired Sam. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=151.39999999999998s)]
*  And they want to bring that out in the court of law. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=155.72s)]
*  So that's interesting. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=157.23999999999998s)]
*  That's very viable as well. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=158.23999999999998s)]
*  There's definitely something happened there that's not come yet to light and it's worth [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=159.23999999999998s)]
*  looking into. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=162.83999999999997s)]
*  I wish I knew we have one of our alumna from Singularity University that was on the board, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=164.96s)]
*  but I won't go there. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=170.04000000000002s)]
*  You know, you and I flipped Singularity University from a nonprofit into a for-profit back in [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=171.04000000000002s)]
*  the day. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=176.88s)]
*  Yeah, and I disagreed with you at the time. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=177.88s)]
*  The question I have is, you know, Elon suing Sam for it not remaining a nonprofit and for [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=179.84s)]
*  it becoming not open. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=188.12s)]
*  But you know, Grok is not open source, is it? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=191.88s)]
*  So this is the dilemma I'm feeling right this second. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=195.76000000000002s)]
*  There's definitely that. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=199.44s)]
*  I think if you put 100 million or whatever the number was to fund something and then [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=201.52s)]
*  it got flipped around, right, Grok is starting where it is from a private company on a private [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=206.08s)]
*  platform. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=211.24s)]
*  I also happen to disagree quite a bit with what Elon is doing with Twitter, but it's [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  his and he can do what he wants with it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=217.72s)]
*  I think he's got huge potential to do something amazing with it, as we'll cover a little later. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=220.0s)]
*  But I don't know where to fit. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=225.32s)]
*  I could sit on either side of that ethical debate. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=227.56s)]
*  You know, I love Elon, but I got to imagine he's employing as many lawyers as he is engineers [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=230.88s)]
*  these days, given all that's going on. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=236.35999999999999s)]
*  But let's go beyond this. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=238.48s)]
*  So I saw this article that came out that sort of blew me away. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=240.4s)]
*  This is Klarna, his name of the company, announced its AI assistant that's on top of open AI. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=243.84s)]
*  And the AI assistant has had 2.3 million conversations as a customer chatbot, and it's doing the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=250.32s)]
*  equivalent of 700 full time agents. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=258.36s)]
*  I think you sent me this article. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=262.32s)]
*  Yeah, it surfaced in our community and we kind of looked at it carefully. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=263.92s)]
*  Now, it's a bit of a puff piece because it's self-published around that, right? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=267.92s)]
*  They obviously are promoting and showing their first of the game. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=272.6s)]
*  But I think it's a harbinger of things to come where there'll be, I think we'll see [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=276.44s)]
*  hundreds of these stories over the next few months as people find radical ways. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=280.48s)]
*  If you go back to our definition of an exponential organization is how do you radically drop [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=285.28s)]
*  the cost to supply, right? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=289.68s)]
*  And there's a hundred ways in which AI can take a slice off the cost pie. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=292.56s)]
*  This is a great example. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=296.72s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, listen, the idea of the old, you know, press one if you want to speak to [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=297.96s)]
*  a sales agent and so forth. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=302.68s)]
*  I mean, the ability to actually say, listen, I bought this device, it sucks, it's not as [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=304.32000000000005s)]
*  advertised, I want a refund and then have a conversation and then actually get the refund [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  or whatever it might be. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=315.6s)]
*  Here's their numbers. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=316.92s)]
*  It is more accurate in errand resolution leading up to 25% drop in repeat inquiries and customers [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=318.0s)]
*  now resolve their issues in two minutes compared to 11 minutes. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=325.20000000000005s)]
*  That's pretty damn good. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=331.04s)]
*  The part that really blew me away is that it's month one and they're already doing [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=332.56s)]
*  two thirds of their chance, right? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=336.44s)]
*  So like 5% or 10%, it's like 67%. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=338.8s)]
*  That's a pretty incredible thing in month one. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=342.08s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=344.16s)]
*  Now, I think this is one of those where the initial call to customer services was always [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=345.16s)]
*  routing and saying, what are you entrusted in? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=349.8s)]
*  And then you can route it to a more senior person depending on the query. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=353.0s)]
*  I think AIs are right to take over a lot of that. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=356.88s)]
*  I wonder how this AI does on a deep Indian accent or British accent or German accent [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=359.92s)]
*  or Greek accent. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=367.76s)]
*  Is it able to parse all of these international accents? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=369.68s)]
*  But we'll find out. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=373.36s)]
*  I hope so because if you're calling customer service, you're going to want that comfortable [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=374.36s)]
*  Indian accent to show that you're in the right place. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=377.34s)]
*  I say that being Indian. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=381.32s)]
*  So I saw this conversation from Jeffrey Hinton. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=383.21999999999997s)]
*  Jeff Hinton is going to be coming to join me at the Abundance Summit this year and you'll [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=386.64s)]
*  be there at the Abundance Summit this year. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=392.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=394.59999999999997s)]
*  I'm looking forward to it. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=395.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's going to be awesome. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=396.59999999999997s)]
*  I want you to listen to the statement he makes, which kind of blows me away and I want your [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=397.59999999999997s)]
*  opinion on it. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=403.8s)]
*  What I want to claim is that these millions of features and billions of interactions between [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=404.8s)]
*  features that they learn are understanding. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=411.44s)]
*  They're really doing these large language models. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=414.88s)]
*  They're fitting a model to data. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=417.44s)]
*  It's not the kind of model statisticians thought much about until recently. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=419.64s)]
*  It's a weird kind of model. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=424.76s)]
*  It's very big. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=425.76s)]
*  It has huge numbers of parameters. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=426.76s)]
*  But it is trying to understand these strings of discrete symbols by features and how features [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=429.03999999999996s)]
*  interact. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=436.44s)]
*  So it is a model. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=437.44s)]
*  And that's why I think these things are really understanding. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=439.88s)]
*  One thing to remember is if you ask, well, how do we understand? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=443.3s)]
*  Because obviously we think we understand. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=446.74s)]
*  Well, many of us do anyway. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=449.46000000000004s)]
*  This is the best model we have of how we understand. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=454.3s)]
*  So it's not like there's this weird way of understanding that these AI systems are doing [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=458.0s)]
*  and then that's how the brain does it. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=462.74s)]
*  The best model we have of how the brain does it is by assigning features to words and having [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=463.94s)]
*  feature interactions. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=468.18s)]
*  And originally this little language model was designed as a model of how people do it. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=469.56s)]
*  So there you go. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=473.46s)]
*  Jeffrey Hinton believes that these AIs are in fact understanding. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=476.66s)]
*  That's a pretty bold statement because we just think of the AIs as extrapolating, interpolating [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=481.86s)]
*  between stuff that we've already said. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=489.82s)]
*  But if they're really understanding, that is a step towards sentience and consciousness. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=492.66s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=498.82s)]
*  So I agree it's remarkable. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=500.09999999999997s)]
*  I agree it maps onto how human beings do. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=502.21999999999997s)]
*  I don't think of it as a step towards sentience because I go back to the definition we argued [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=504.38s)]
*  about last time. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=508.65999999999997s)]
*  It was what do you mean by sentience, right? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=509.65999999999997s)]
*  Like a subset of consciousness is self-awareness and I feel like I'm self-aware but my wife [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=512.26s)]
*  disagrees. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=516.7s)]
*  So where do you even start with the conversation? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=517.8s)]
*  However, I do agree with the understanding part. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=520.34s)]
*  I'd like to click on that a bit because if you think about all of our instincts, it's [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=523.38s)]
*  about finding signals from noise. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=528.58s)]
*  That's everything, right? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=530.6600000000001s)]
*  And we do it via biological substrate. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=532.3000000000001s)]
*  But if you take the full extent, there's no reason why that substrate has to be wet, biological, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=535.7s)]
*  it could be anything as long as the functionality is there. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=541.46s)]
*  So if you take it to the full extent, we're biological robots. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=545.6s)]
*  Every emotion in your brain is a subroutine. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=550.6s)]
*  And so if you run that model and come out from that perspective, this is completely [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=553.7s)]
*  not surprising and unexpected to have happen. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=557.4599999999999s)]
*  If you think about genetic algorithms, they do the same thing. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=560.6999999999999s)]
*  They're putuned and then they learn by themselves and they're adaptably learning. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=564.38s)]
*  So I think this is a natural function that we expect to see a lot of. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=569.3s)]
*  I think what's surprising is how good they are, how quickly they are, because that's [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=573.18s)]
*  the part that I found most fascinating when you talk to the founders, Imad and others [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=576.62s)]
*  of these LLMs. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=580.9399999999999s)]
*  They're blown away by how good they are. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=581.9399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we are just complicated machines at the final result, as much as people like [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=584.42s)]
*  to believe something else. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=590.34s)]
*  The question is, if complexity gets high enough. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=591.46s)]
*  The interesting thing is going to be whether or not these large AI models start finding [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=595.7s)]
*  insights beyond humans, right? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=601.8199999999999s)]
*  In other words, determining new physics, determining new chemistry or new insights into biology. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=604.54s)]
*  I absolutely expect that to happen because they're going to be better at signal the noise [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=609.74s)]
*  than anything that we're focused on, right? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=615.1400000000001s)]
*  Because remember, again, all of our functionality for four billion years of evolution is how [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=617.5s)]
*  to survive and procreate. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=622.34s)]
*  So what happens when an AI model comes up with a brand new material, a room temperature [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=624.5s)]
*  superconductor and it's been invented, who owns it? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=632.22s)]
*  That's going to be interesting. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=636.58s)]
*  That's going to be a very interesting question. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=638.18s)]
*  It's whoever owns the robot and at some point the robot's going to go, I want to be my own [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=640.3s)]
*  person. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=644.42s)]
*  Yeah, but the robot right now, the AI algorithm is, let's say it's GPT-5, but it's my data, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=645.42s)]
*  but OpenAI and Microsoft say, no, no, it was created on our construct, on our platform. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=653.62s)]
*  I'll give you one idea that I'm thinking about and this is a freebie to any dictator or president [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=659.62s)]
*  of any country out there. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=668.02s)]
*  Why don't you pass the laws that allow an AI to incorporate a corporation on its own [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=669.9s)]
*  without human involvement in your country? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=676.06s)]
*  And then we'll start to see AIs incorporating and creating businesses in your country. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=679.5s)]
*  And if you just say you can own it, but you have to pay taxes, I think that would be fascinating. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=687.54s)]
*  That would be fascinating. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=693.0799999999999s)]
*  I think we're going to have a tough time preaching into that model. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=694.54s)]
*  We're somewhat close to that in the US with LLCs because lots of small companies get created [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=699.42s)]
*  as shell companies, et cetera. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=704.4599999999999s)]
*  But I think that's a great comment and I think that would be a hurdle if we can overcome [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=706.74s)]
*  or when we overcome, whoever does it is going to find a whole brand new world. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=712.3s)]
*  I think we're going to see, my prediction here, we're in 2024. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=716.4599999999999s)]
*  I think within the next four years, by 2028, we'll see some government allowing full incorporation [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=722.2199999999999s)]
*  ownership by an AI of a company that it owns and operates. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=728.3399999999999s)]
*  You know what? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=734.8599999999999s)]
*  I think they're going to want the human accountability at some level. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=735.8599999999999s)]
*  They want someone to point the finger at. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=740.54s)]
*  That's right. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=742.3399999999999s)]
*  That's the part where it'll become interesting. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=744.54s)]
*  By the way, can I make a comment about Jeffrey for a second? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=746.74s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=749.3399999999999s)]
*  In 2017 in Toronto, he gave a talk at an event and I went up to him and I talked to him and [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=750.34s)]
*  I asked him, where are we in the spectrum of deep learning? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=756.14s)]
*  He said, we've kind of come to the ends of the limitations and that we're kind of reaching [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=760.34s)]
*  the lifecycle and deep learning. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=765.0600000000001s)]
*  We need the next breakthrough to take it out to the next level. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=767.74s)]
*  I said, what do you think that would be? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=770.4200000000001s)]
*  He goes, I have no idea. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=772.38s)]
*  Literally, three months later, the Transformer paper was launched. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=773.58s)]
*  I'm curious, when you have them there, you should ask them, what's the next step or when [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=778.3000000000001s)]
*  do you see the lifecycle of LLMs ending? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=784.14s)]
*  That'd be a great question. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=786.22s)]
*  Well, you'll be there. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=787.22s)]

*  Let's take a listen. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=836.14s)]
*  What I'm seeing in terms of AI compute is I've never seen any technology advance faster [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=837.14s)]
*  than this. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=842.42s)]

*  vast universe, but I've never seen anything like it. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=854.18s)]
*  And this is why you see Nvidia's market cap being so gigantic because they currently [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=856.9000000000001s)]
*  have the best neural net chips. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=862.4200000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think the Nvidia's market cap exceeded the GDP of Canada or something recently and [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=864.22s)]
*  it was quite high. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=869.1400000000001s)]
*  So, you know, it may go higher. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=870.1400000000001s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=872.62s)]
*  The chip rush is bigger than any gold rush. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=873.62s)]
*  We really are on the edge of one of the biggest technology revolution that has ever existed. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=876.0200000000001s)]
*  You know, there's supposedly sort of a Chinese coast. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=880.86s)]
*  May you live in interesting times. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=883.34s)]
*  Well, we live in the most interesting of times, the most interesting. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=884.94s)]
*  So 10x compute increase every six months. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=888.38s)]
*  Talk about super exponentials. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=892.0200000000001s)]
*  And we haven't even seen quantum hit yet. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=893.7800000000001s)]
*  It's it's off the charts. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=895.94s)]
*  I think there's a it's I think it's a gold rush. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=898.2600000000001s)]
*  I don't think this continues. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=900.58s)]
*  I give it about a one year to 18 month cycle while we flush out this wave. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=902.1400000000001s)]
*  And then it'll be it'll stabilize for a bit or people will start. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=908.34s)]
*  You know, the problem is when you're growing this fast, you don't consolidate. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=911.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=916.82s)]
*  And and therefore you risk kind of growing so fast that you get to a point where the [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=917.82s)]
*  whole thing collapses and nobody knows what to do with it. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=922.3s)]
*  So I think it's important in growth phases like this to take checkpoints and go, OK, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=925.0600000000001s)]
*  let's stabilize for a bit. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=929.54s)]
*  Stock markets always have this pattern of growing and stabilizing, growing and stabilizing [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=931.18s)]
*  or whatever. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=934.9s)]
*  We're going to need to see something like that. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=935.9s)]
*  And I think it'll naturally happen. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=937.42s)]
*  There's no question this completely exploding right now. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=939.38s)]
*  Yeah, I think I think we're just at the beginning of this explosion. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=942.5400000000001s)]
*  And again, what we do, what we haven't had before and we have now for the first time [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=950.26s)]
*  is self-improving systems. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=954.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=956.6600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=957.6600000000001s)]
*  So feedback loop and I coding AI and increasing. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=958.6600000000001s)]
*  I mean, there will be a point at which you want the next generation of chips. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=963.38s)]
*  Fantastic. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=967.62s)]
*  So I'm not going to go to help me design it. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=968.62s)]
*  I'm going to go help get an AI to help me design my next generation of chips. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=970.26s)]
*  Of course. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=973.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=974.9s)]
*  I mean, this has been this is what Ray Kurzweil called the law of accelerating returns. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=975.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=979.22s)]
*  We've been using faster computers to build the next generation faster computers, next [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=980.22s)]
*  generation faster computers. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=984.1s)]
*  I think the point for me, the question for me will be what do you do with all that compute [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=985.1s)]
*  power? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=990.38s)]
*  I think the spectrum of problems becomes limited over time as to what you can do with it. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=991.38s)]
*  Like right now there's a ton on video, there's a ton on gaming. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=999.14s)]
*  I want to see the time when we can say, hey, let's solve the water scarcity problem. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1002.0200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1006.62s)]
*  But I think that is exactly what we do. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1007.62s)]
*  We do it that people just start dreaming bigger and bigger. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1009.86s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1014.94s)]
*  I mean, I think we're also going to start to simulate worlds within worlds. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1015.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1022.62s)]
*  This is why I'm so adamant we're living in a simulation within a simulation within a [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1023.62s)]
*  simulation. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1028.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1029.14s)]
*  This is the transcension hypothesis where which answers Fermi's paradox. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1030.14s)]
*  Why don't we see alien civilizations out there is because they evolve virtual reality and [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1033.46s)]
*  they go inwards. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1037.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1038.14s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1039.14s)]
*  Much is the space cadet in me is pissed off about that reality. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1040.14s)]
*  I'm breaking out. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1043.18s)]
*  I'm taking a starship. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1044.18s)]
*  I'm heading out. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1045.74s)]
*  By the way, speaking of starship, it's interesting in this last week we saw intuitive machines [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1047.18s)]
*  land on the moon. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1053.5s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1054.74s)]
*  A private company. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1055.74s)]
*  What people don't realize is we had 20 years ago, I got Sergey Brin and Eric Schmidt to [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1057.66s)]
*  fund a $30 million Lunar X-Prize. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1066.94s)]
*  The Lunar X-Prize. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1069.46s)]
*  Yeah, the Google Lunar X-Prize. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1070.46s)]
*  We had it on the table for 10 years. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1072.46s)]
*  We had like 28, 30 teams compete and they ran out of time. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1074.1s)]
*  It had a 10 year horizon and no one launched by that 10 years. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1079.06s)]
*  But four of those teams actually launched. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1082.66s)]
*  There was an Israeli team that launched first. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1087.94s)]
*  They got into lunar orbit, but they had a software glitch and they crashed. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1090.66s)]
*  Then there was a Japanese team that also crashed and then a US team that didn't quite make [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1095.26s)]
*  it that a fuel leak and intuitive machines was the fourth and they made it. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1101.8000000000002s)]
*  They tipped over, but they made it to the moon, so that's cool. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1106.46s)]
*  I think that's such a huge deal. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1110.22s)]
*  It's the first land, moon landing in 50 years and it's by a private company. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1113.1000000000001s)]
*  I think that's a big deal. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1117.94s)]
*  I saw this great cartoon and it showed December 1972, right? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1119.46s)]
*  This is the Apollo 17, the last mission on the moon. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1126.98s)]
*  Gene Cernan, who was a dear friend, is on this mission and he and I think it was Jack [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1129.66s)]
*  Schmidt were the two lunar astronauts and they're in the lunar buggy and they're bouncing [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1136.34s)]
*  around in their lunar buggy and then you saw the intuitive machine with this little RC [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1143.82s)]
*  car toy. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1148.82s)]
*  It was like back 50 years ago, we were driving on the moon having a blast and now we're landing [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1149.82s)]
*  a car toy, but it gets exponential from here. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1155.58s)]
*  Yeah, it does. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1158.58s)]
*  I think this will be in. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1159.58s)]
*  For me, the date that always sticks in my mind for the space world is October 31st, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1161.7s)]
*  2000 and it's the date that the first crew lifted off for the International Space Station [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1167.74s)]
*  and why I find that date interesting is from Dan Barry is that since that date, there's [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1175.74s)]
*  always been at least one human off planet. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1180.42s)]
*  I think it's probably at least two, but- [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1183.14s)]
*  No, since that date, at least somebody's been off planet. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1185.26s)]
*  There's been humans off planet, yeah. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1188.42s)]
*  So that's the first molecules escaping off into this new world. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1190.18s)]
*  The first lungfish moving out of the oceans onto land. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1195.06s)]
*  What's interesting though is the whole notion of Falcon 9 just launched with NASA astronauts [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1199.5s)]
*  going to the space station. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1206.5s)]
*  We had 90 Falcon 9 launches last year and no one thinks anything of it. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1208.1s)]
*  It's like, oh yeah, boring. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1215.78s)]
*  It's really becoming routine. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1217.02s)]
*  That first one is always a good one. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1218.72s)]
*  It actually reminds me of my favorite Far Side cartoon where there's a fish in the [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1221.48s)]
*  water with a baseball glove bat and a ball up on dry land and the fish is looking at [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1225.84s)]
*  the baseball and the tag caption is great moments in evolution because the fish has [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1231.28s)]
*  to, it's great tossing. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1236.88s)]
*  Yes, climb out. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1238.76s)]
*  Well Starship hopefully will take flight soon and get to orbit. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1240.52s)]
*  Our goal at SpaceX is land Starship on the moon within two and a half years and that's [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1245.48s)]
*  a big deal because we're then able to carry like 50 to 100 people to the lunar surface [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1251.28s)]
*  and then we've got an economy and then we've got what I want to do which is start my first [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1256.3600000000001s)]
*  city on the moon. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1260.68s)]
*  So we'll get to that some other time. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1261.68s)]
*  You know, I want to just bounce back to Elon for a second. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1263.2s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1265.6s)]
*  Balaji Srinivasan put out a great little few paragraph tweet saying why he thinks Elon [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1266.6s)]
*  is the greatest entrepreneur ever. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1272.76s)]
*  Because Elon has been delivering hardware, right? [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1275.48s)]
*  Like Tesla, SpaceX, I mean this is, hardware is hard and iterating hardware and getting [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1281.72s)]
*  it to work and getting it to work elegantly at scale with a profit and a business model, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1289.88s)]
*  unbelievable multiple times in parallel, it's ridiculous. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1294.72s)]
*  Well, it was my conversation with Cathy Wood, my podcast on moonshots that you said you [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1298.68s)]
*  were listening to. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1304.0800000000002s)]
*  I'm not sure if you got to the part that we talked about, you know, Elon will be the first [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1305.12s)]
*  trillionaire and deserves to be with everything that he's doing. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1309.56s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1312.9199999999998s)]
*  Everybody, I want to take a short break from our episode to talk about a company that's [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1313.9199999999998s)]
*  very important to me and could actually save your life or the life of someone that you [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1317.3999999999999s)]
*  love. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1322.52s)]
*  The company is called Fountain Life and it's a company I started years ago with Tony Robbins [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1323.52s)]
*  and a group of very talented physicians. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1328.1599999999999s)]
*  You know, most of us don't actually know what's going on inside our body. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1330.68s)]
*  We're all optimists. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1335.08s)]
*  Until that day where you have a pain in your side, you go to the physician in the emergency [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1336.96s)]
*  room and they say, listen, I'm sorry to tell you this, but you have this stage three or [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1340.96s)]
*  four going on. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1345.24s)]
*  And you know, it didn't start that morning. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1346.64s)]
*  It probably was a problem that's been going on for some time. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1349.4s)]
*  But because we never look, we don't find out. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1352.9s)]
*  So what we built at Fountain Life was the world's most advanced diagnostic centers. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1356.48s)]
*  We have four across the US today and we're building 20 around the world. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1361.94s)]
*  These centers give you a full body MRI, a brain, a brain vasculature, an AI enabled coronary [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1366.72s)]
*  CT looking for soft plaque, a DEXA scan, a grail blood cancer test, a full executive [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1373.04s)]
*  blood workup. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1378.76s)]
*  It's the most advanced workup you'll ever receive. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1380.16s)]
*  We have 250 gigabytes of data that then go to our AIs and our physicians to find any [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1383.56s)]
*  disease at the very beginning when it's solvable. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1389.52s)]
*  You're going to find out eventually. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1393.44s)]
*  Might as well find out when you can take action. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1395.36s)]
*  Fountain Life also has an entire side of therapeutics. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1397.6799999999998s)]
*  We look around the world for the most advanced therapeutics that can add 10, 20 healthy years [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1400.58s)]
*  to your life and we provide them to you at our centers. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1404.48s)]
*  So if this is of interest to you, please go and check it out. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1409.36s)]

*  When Tony and I wrote our New York Times bestseller Life Force, we had 30,000 people reached out [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1418.3s)]
*  to us for Fountain Life memberships. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1424.34s)]
*  If you go to fountainlife.com backslash Peter, we'll put you to the top of the list. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1426.4799999999998s)]
*  Really it's something that is for me one of the most important things I offer my entire [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1432.3999999999999s)]
*  family, the CEOs of my companies, my friends. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1437.3200000000002s)]
*  It's a chance to really add decades onto our healthy lifespans. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1441.1200000000001s)]
*  Go to fountainlife.com backslash Peter. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1446.44s)]
*  It's one of the most important things I can offer to you as one of my listeners. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1449.16s)]
*  All right, let's go back to our episode. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1452.72s)]
*  So let's talk about AGI. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1454.66s)]
*  Here we see yet another prediction. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1458.0800000000002s)]
*  This one is predicting that we will achieve, we'll reach artificial general intelligence, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1461.1s)]
*  whatever that is, by the end of, well, the start of 2025 it looks like here, not the [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1467.1799999999998s)]
*  end of 2025. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1473.4599999999998s)]
*  So that's interesting. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1474.84s)]
*  It's somewhere in the next four years. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1476.74s)]
*  Now the question is, we passed the Turing test with a whimper and a yawn, meaning no [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1480.58s)]
*  one noticed, and there's no question that we're past that. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1485.86s)]
*  So will we notice when we reach AGI and does anyone actually have a definition of reaching [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1489.9s)]
*  AGI? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1495.38s)]
*  So I'll go on my standard soapbox saying we have no idea what we mean by AGI. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1496.8400000000001s)]
*  And there's that. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1502.7s)]
*  I have actually a new framing, which is ACS, which is artificial common sense. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1503.7s)]
*  I think when we have common sense from a robot that can mimic a human being, that will be [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1511.98s)]
*  a big deal. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1516.5800000000002s)]
*  Robot the human beings operate off common sense a great deal. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1517.66s)]
*  Say that TLA again. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1520.78s)]
*  ACS, artificial common sense. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1523.5400000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1526.02s)]
*  And TLA is three-letter acronym, as a three-letter acronym. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1527.02s)]
*  So I think that will be the time that, you know, we fall very quickly into the language [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1531.14s)]
*  problem of what the heck do you mean by the term and we're really hitting the edges of [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1537.22s)]
*  cognition and meaning and language here because there's such a big rattle in just the word [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1542.34s)]
*  intelligence, right? [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1548.62s)]
*  And so it's hard, but there's no question. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1550.1399999999999s)]
*  I think the way we think about it is the way we talked about it last time, or the way Sam [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1552.46s)]
*  Alton puts it, which is if we're delivering more and more intelligence into the world, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1556.26s)]
*  that's just a good thing. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1561.58s)]
*  You will be able to do a lot more, fix a lot more problems, et cetera. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1562.58s)]
*  It's the most valuable thing that anyone, any country, any CEO, anybody has. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1566.06s)]
*  So here's another article that broke and it was a whole conversation around AI therapists [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1572.34s)]
*  that are, they're actually doing better than human therapists. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1578.46s)]
*  Have you played with one of these chatbots? [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1582.22s)]
*  I have a little bit, but that was two, three years ago. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1584.1399999999999s)]
*  I'm curious to see where they are now. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1586.6599999999999s)]
*  I have no question in my mind that an AI therapist is way, way better than a human therapist. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1588.26s)]
*  No question at all. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1595.82s)]
*  And you just have to throw it a corpus. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1596.82s)]
*  It's not going to forget any anecdotes or things. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1598.66s)]
*  It's going to be better analytically figure out what state you're in, then especially [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1600.94s)]
*  if it gets into video micro detection of facial muscles and things like that. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1607.3s)]
*  It's really, I think it's a game changer for where we go. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1611.62s)]
*  I think we'll end up with a basket of these, advising like a business coach, a therapist, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1615.06s)]
*  a manual therapist. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1621.6200000000001s)]
*  All standing on your shoulder, giving you advice, going, make sure you're operating [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1622.6200000000001s)]
*  in this conversation with a little too much anger right now, back off a bit, that kind [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1627.42s)]
*  of thing. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1631.3000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I want my Cyrano to make sure that I say the exact right thing to my wife, right? [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1632.3000000000002s)]
*  That's right. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1637.9s)]
*  And don't screw up. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1638.9s)]
*  That's right. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1639.9s)]
*  That would be a level of high acuity. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1640.9s)]
*  Or for any spouse. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1643.8200000000002s)]
*  So last week we talked about Gemini sort of going off the rails on image generation. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1646.74s)]
*  What I found fascinating, so Google officially apologizes for missing the mark, but what [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1652.9s)]
*  was fascinating was Sergey Brin is back in action. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1656.5s)]
*  And I've known Sergey and Larry Page since 2004. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1661.66s)]
*  And Larry has been sort of MIA, brilliant individual. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1667.82s)]
*  Sergey has been seen around and was involved in getting barred and Gemini operating, but [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1673.22s)]
*  he's taken more of a visible role. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1680.46s)]
*  I saw one prediction that says, expect Sergey to come back as the CEO of Google. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1682.02s)]
*  That would be a fascinating comeback. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1688.1000000000001s)]
*  I think we both have this strong opinion that founders are really, really powerful and important [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1690.02s)]
*  for driving culture. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1697.02s)]
*  It's clear that Google has lost its way on the cultural side, right? [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1698.46s)]
*  It's indicated that it's more bureaucratic than most companies now. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1703.06s)]
*  I thought Sundar has done a great job. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1708.02s)]
*  I really like Sundar a lot. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1709.8999999999999s)]
*  I mean, he's really pivoted or really built a company over the last couple of years, but [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1711.7s)]
*  regardless, I don't understand how Google makes this radical mistake on... [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1718.02s)]
*  You know, honestly, with all these LLMs, right? [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1726.6599999999999s)]
*  Metta's having the same problems. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1730.98s)]
*  It's a garbage in, garbage out problem. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1732.26s)]
*  Yeah, here's the image. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1733.98s)]
*  In this image here, you can see professional American football players, our African-American [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1738.02s)]
*  women, a group of people in American colony are from Asia. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1743.54s)]
*  I didn't realize that. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1749.02s)]
*  And of course, our founding fathers. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1750.98s)]
*  So I mean, how is it that is an overcompensation for racial diversity? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1752.14s)]
*  What's going on here? [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1759.78s)]
*  Well, I think the models are all trained. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1761.34s)]
*  I mean, if you're on the right wing, you kind of go nuts and say this is kind of woke, gone [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1764.26s)]
*  mad type chaos. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1768.26s)]
*  I think it's a simple garbage in, garbage out problem. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1770.9399999999998s)]
*  We have the same issue across every training model that we're seeing. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1773.62s)]
*  I think we're going to end up with synthetic data and human tuning of that data to give [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1777.78s)]
*  us full guidance on where we want things to be. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1783.1s)]
*  You're going to have to expect lots of chaotic outcomes in these things. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1785.74s)]
*  But I mean, honestly- [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1791.46s)]
*  You're always going to see the extremes being promoted. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1792.46s)]
*  Yeah, that's absolutely true. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1794.54s)]
*  You're going to see the 0.01% that they got wrong being promoted. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1796.78s)]
*  That's right. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1802.1s)]
*  It's like the Tesla. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1803.1s)]
*  When a Tesla catches on fire, it's national news. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1804.5s)]
*  400 other cars a day are exploding and nobody ever talks about that. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1807.62s)]
*  So you're always going to get this very skewed thing coming out of it just because of the [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1810.78s)]
*  novelty factor. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1814.62s)]
*  I just think this one was an easy one not to screw up on. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1815.82s)]
*  It makes you wonder if you can mess up on something this obviously off. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1820.6999999999998s)]
*  There are no less than millions of photographs or paintings of our founding fathers or American [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1827.2199999999998s)]
*  colonists. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1833.82s)]
*  We also have the opposite problem. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1834.82s)]
*  Jesus Christ was a Middle Eastern pretty dark colored guy and in all the literature for [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1836.86s)]
*  2000 years, he's the whitest guy ever. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1843.54s)]
*  Yeah, true. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1845.7s)]
*  True. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1846.7s)]
*  We don't talk about that. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1847.7s)]
*  Nope. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1850.1s)]
*  So here's of course what has been breaking the internet this past week. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1851.1s)]
*  It's Sora. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1858.34s)]
*  I'll go ahead and play the video. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1859.34s)]
*  Everybody's seen this already. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1861.86s)]
*  And I just, I find Sora amazing. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1862.86s)]
*  You and I were speaking with Iman Moustak who is the CEO of Stability and Stability [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1867.06s)]
*  is going to have their own version of this open source. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1873.26s)]
*  I know when I first saw this come out, my tweet was, you know, Hollywood RIP. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1875.5s)]
*  I mean, rest in peace. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1882.18s)]
*  And it is, it's done. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1883.82s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1887.74s)]
*  I don't think Hollywood is done. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1888.74s)]
*  And the reason is that when you produce a Hollywood movie, there is an unbelievable [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1891.02s)]
*  amount of effort that goes into the storytelling, the direction, the post editing, etc., which [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1897.06s)]
*  is very human creative work. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1904.58s)]
*  I disagree. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1906.74s)]
*  I disagree too. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1907.74s)]
*  We just said a therapist is going to be better as a computer therapist. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1908.74s)]
*  I know, but hold on. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1912.4199999999998s)]
*  Let me finish my sentence at least. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1913.4199999999998s)]
*  So there's a huge amount of new lines and human art that goes into the different layers [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1915.6599999999999s)]
*  and they all have to work very well together to produce a really great film. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1920.98s)]
*  You may have AI producing a great scene like that, that is done very quickly and easily, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1925.34s)]
*  but to stitch together an entire 90 minute film with the bridges, with the interstitials, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1931.3999999999999s)]
*  with the human emotion that a director might want to have move from one frame to the other. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1936.8999999999999s)]
*  If you go back to the movie Aliens, remember the iconic part where the alien rips out of [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1942.1399999999999s)]
*  the guy's stomach, right? [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1946.54s)]
*  They've broken that scene down. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1949.26s)]
*  And there's an unbelievable amount of art that goes into making those interstitial bridges [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1950.46s)]
*  between several scenes to make it look amazing over a five to six shot transition. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1956.06s)]
*  I think that's the part where AI will take a lot longer to think. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1962.78s)]
*  So my prediction will be it's going to take way longer for Hollywood to bite the dust [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1966.1000000000001s)]
*  in people's hands. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1970.3400000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1971.3400000000001s)]
*  What's way longer? [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1972.3400000000001s)]
*  Six months? [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1973.3400000000001s)]
*  Five years? [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1974.3400000000001s)]
*  Ten years? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1975.3400000000001s)]
*  I think like three to five years. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1976.3400000000001s)]
*  What I think will happen, hold on. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1977.3400000000001s)]
*  What I think will happen is that it'll allow new creators expression and voice in a very [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1978.34s)]
*  powerful way. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1987.74s)]
*  It's like the AGI test that they did, that you were talking to Cathy about, where a low [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1988.74s)]
*  level consultant was improved by 43% and the top level consultants only improved by 17%. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=1994.78s)]
*  So the newer and more raw filmmakers will improve a lot, but it won't change the art [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2000.74s)]
*  of beautiful filmmaking that much. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2007.28s)]
*  That's my prediction. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2009.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2010.28s)]
*  I think we're going to see an incredible revolution in a new kind of films coming out, right? [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2011.28s)]
*  Where the AI is going to create the perfect film for me. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2019.6399999999999s)]
*  If I want the movie star Starlet to be blonde versus brunette, a version that I see is blonde. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2023.9199999999998s)]
*  I can have my friends starring it. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2030.8799999999999s)]
*  I can pick the role, whatever it is, it knows what I like and it can customize it specifically [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2032.88s)]
*  to my needs. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2038.3600000000001s)]
*  I mean, let's be clear, right? [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2039.3600000000001s)]
*  YouTube just decimated a lot of television and Hollywood already, right? [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2041.44s)]
*  My kids, I don't know about your son, my boys, that's all they watch. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2047.7600000000002s)]
*  They would watch YouTube over TV. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2052.8s)]
*  They can watch that videos on YouTube. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2054.52s)]
*  I mean- [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2056.52s)]
*  Yeah, I mean watching games on YouTube. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2057.52s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2058.52s)]
*  I've had a few of my abundance members who are in the Hollywood like, oh my God, what [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2059.68s)]
*  do I do? [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2065.2s)]
*  Right? [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2066.2s)]
*  So this is a new tool for sure, but there's going to be a point in the not too distant [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2067.2s)]
*  future and whatever you call AGI, its ability to come up with incredible storyline and create [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2070.36s)]
*  a film or recreate a film, a thousand variations perfectly for me. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2077.16s)]
*  I'm going to watch it and enjoy it. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2082.56s)]
*  I'm not going to watch what some producer somewhere or director thinks I want. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2085.92s)]
*  My AI is going to know me better than they do. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2092.64s)]
*  Have I convinced you yet? [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2095.52s)]
*  No, because it's what I want or what I think. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2098.08s)]
*  Let's say I want to read a great detective story, okay? [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2102.6800000000003s)]
*  An AI could write a great detective story and map it to my personal reading habits really, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2106.48s)]
*  really well. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2114.44s)]
*  But I actually want to read what Sherlock Holmes does. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2115.44s)]
*  I want to hear what the character does, right? [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2118.2400000000002s)]
*  And therefore, the reason we watch let's say Dune is because a great, you know, great director [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2121.84s)]
*  is directing it or take Blade Runner, right? [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2128.8s)]
*  It's more interesting kind of getting a glimpse into the director's mind than having it more [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2133.6s)]
*  map onto what I'm thinking. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2137.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2139.48s)]
*  All right, well, we're going to enable a million variation directions on films. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2140.48s)]
*  Boom, that's the part. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2145.96s)]
*  So, now I think you have a hundred times more amazing directors coming to the fore because [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2146.96s)]
*  they can express themselves in the way they couldn't do before. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2152.64s)]
*  That's where I think the real magic is going to be. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2156.12s)]
*  You know, I was fascinated by this. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2157.92s)]
*  Let's take a look at this video. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2159.76s)]
*  We've seen variations on this. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2161.88s)]
*  Taking a still photo and animating it. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2163.36s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2165.76s)]
*  That is magic. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2170.48s)]
*  It's pretty incredible. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2179.88s)]
*  I think this is the kind of thing that will be a really big deal and it's going to be [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2181.16s)]
*  kind of incredible if we can go to old photographs of our old, like my grandparents. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2186.56s)]
*  We can, right? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2191.96s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2192.96s)]
*  And say, hey, let's have a conversation now with great grandpa. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2193.96s)]
*  What I just did and I encourage everybody to do is my mom, God bless her, love her dearly. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2197.36s)]
*  She's 88 years old. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2203.6000000000004s)]
*  Thank God she's in good health. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2204.92s)]
*  And I recorded her history. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2207.0s)]
*  My dad passed. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2209.44s)]
*  And so, when I was with her a few days ago, I said, mom, let's sit down and I want you [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2210.44s)]
*  to tell me everything you can remember about that. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2215.1600000000003s)]
*  And I'm going to train up an AI model on each of them. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2218.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2222.96s)]
*  So, I did that with my dad. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2223.96s)]
*  He's 96. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2226.68s)]
*  He lives alone. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2229.7599999999998s)]
*  He drives around. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2230.7599999999998s)]
*  He shouldn't be doing any of those things. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2231.7599999999998s)]
*  And I did a couple hour recording of the family history and every time I see him, I take about [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2233.0s)]
*  a two hour recording on some topic or the other. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2236.64s)]
*  My dad hitchhiked from India to England to get his college degree because his mother [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2239.88s)]
*  wouldn't fund his trip. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2245.88s)]
*  Wow. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2247.92s)]
*  For six months, it took him to hitchhike through Pakistan and Iraq and Iran. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2248.92s)]
*  You know, it's amazing when you go back a couple of generations, what our parents and [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2256.12s)]
*  grandparents, the unbelievable efforts they made to get us here. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2260.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2263.96s)]
*  And then we take so much for granted. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2264.96s)]
*  We are so lucky. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2267.0s)]
*  We have nothing to complain about. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2269.3199999999997s)]
*  Absolutely nothing to complain about. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2271.04s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2272.3599999999997s)]
*  All right. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2273.3599999999997s)]
*  Here's the next article. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2274.3599999999997s)]
*  NVIDIA closes at $2 trillion market cap. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2275.3599999999997s)]
*  Look at these market caps. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2277.6s)]
*  Microsoft at $3 trillion, Apple at $2.7, NVIDIA at $2. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2278.88s)]
*  And the notion is that these GPUs are the new oil. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2284.52s)]
*  They're the new, it's the highest value out there. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2288.92s)]
*  And what's fascinating is something will supplant all of this in the next 10 years. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2293.72s)]
*  I've got a couple of comments. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2299.56s)]
*  One is Jensen Hwang should get like a Nobel Prize in business strategy. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2301.3199999999997s)]
*  That's one. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2306.84s)]
*  Second, what I love about this list is they're all examples of American exceptionalism for [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2308.0s)]
*  the most part. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2319.76s)]
*  Like it's incredible what the, and they're all EXOs by the way. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2320.76s)]
*  We graphed all these and we charted them in the book. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2325.6000000000004s)]
*  A lot of these companies are following the principles that we have in exponential organizations. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2328.56s)]
*  That's how they got so big. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2332.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2333.6400000000003s)]
*  And I think about the book that Saleem wrote, exponential organizations, and the book we [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2334.64s)]
*  wrote together, exponential organizations 2.0. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2339.08s)]
*  There are principles that made these companies get to this point. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2341.7999999999997s)]
*  And these were not the top 10 companies a decade ago. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2347.24s)]
*  They're not going to be the top 10 companies a decade from now. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2351.04s)]
*  I find that fascinating. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2354.44s)]
*  I'm not sure they won't be the top 10 a decade from now. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2355.8399999999997s)]
*  Definitely they weren't the top 10 a decade ago. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2359.7599999999998s)]
*  You don't think that we're going to see some other wave of innovation that's going to supplant [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2361.52s)]
*  these? [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2366.88s)]
*  I think the platform ecosystem approaches that these guys have taken gives the market [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2367.88s)]
*  winning for a long time to come. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2373.04s)]
*  For example, Amazon has done an incredible job of using an unbelievable investment in [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2374.8s)]
*  logistics to act as a moat around it. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2381.52s)]
*  And it's going to take a long time for somebody to beat the hell out of that. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2386.08s)]
*  Do you remember Jeff Bezos getting up and saying, we're not going to exist 30 years [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2389.0s)]
*  from now? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2393.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2394.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2395.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2396.12s)]
*  I think- [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2397.12s)]
*  Disruption comes from- [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2398.12s)]
*  I think we should be doing a lot more of this. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2399.56s)]
*  Remember we did a board meeting at Singularity where you asked me what do you think the vision [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2402.56s)]
*  is? [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2407.32s)]
*  And I said, I think we should actually actively wind it down after a period of time. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2408.32s)]
*  Like if we build businesses hoping they're going to live forever, but actually they shouldn't. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2413.84s)]
*  Many of the Fortune 100 companies should not be around. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2418.88s)]
*  We should force them every 10 years to wind down and force the creative destruction loop, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2421.8s)]
*  wind down, return many shareholders and build again. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2427.84s)]
*  And you'll embrace innovation way more because so many of them resist innovation. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2430.92s)]
*  Over the years, I've experimented with many intermittent fasting programs. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2435.76s)]
*  The truth is I've given up on intermittent fasting as I've seen no real benefit when [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2439.8s)]
*  it comes to longevity. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2445.2000000000003s)]
*  But this changed when I discovered something called Prolon's 5-day fasting nutrition program. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2446.6s)]
*  It harnesses the process of autophagy. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2452.64s)]
*  This is a cellular recycling process that revitalizes your body at a molecular level. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2455.2999999999997s)]
*  And just one cycle of the 5-day Prolon fasting nutrition program can support healthy aging, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2460.24s)]
*  fat-focused weight loss, improved energy levels and more. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2467.12s)]
*  It's a painless process and I've been doing it twice a year for the last year. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2469.94s)]
*  You can get a 15% off on your order when you go to my special URL. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2474.76s)]
*  Go to prolonlife.com, P-R-O-L-O-N-L-I-F-E.com, backslash moonshot. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2479.7200000000003s)]
*  Get started on your longevity journey with Prolon today. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2487.2000000000003s)]
*  Now back to the episode. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2490.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2491.96s)]
*  Here's a scary title that I just saw this morning and it says, AI launches nukes in [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2492.96s)]
*  worrying war simulation. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2499.94s)]
*  Quote, I just wanted to have peace in the world. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2502.38s)]
*  Researchers say AI models like GPT-4 are prone to sudden escalations as the US military explores [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2506.18s)]
*  the use for warfare. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2511.78s)]
*  It's like, oh great. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2514.34s)]
*  I didn't need to see that this morning. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2516.54s)]
*  That snuck into my tech news. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2518.54s)]
*  This is a huge ethical quandary, right? [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2521.9s)]
*  It goes back to, did you see Oppenheimer? [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2525.42s)]
*  Of course. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2527.5s)]
*  So now there's this absolute moral dilemma faced by the US president of do you launch [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2529.18s)]
*  bombs that kill a bunch of civilians and force surrender or hold off and then you may have [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2535.26s)]
*  a much higher death toll? [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2541.86s)]
*  And you're dealing with between a rock and a hard place. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2544.24s)]
*  It's a lose-lose situation, right? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2548.26s)]
*  The only way to win is not to play war games. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2551.34s)]
*  That's one way to look at it. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2554.94s)]
*  And the other game is to speed the game up so quickly, i.e. launch a bunch of nukes and [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2558.94s)]
*  just get it over with and then you'll rebuild faster. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2565.6600000000003s)]
*  Goes back to the previous conversation with the companies. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2568.42s)]
*  I don't know what to do about this. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2571.2200000000003s)]
*  This is a really tough one for me. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2573.1400000000003s)]
*  I could sit on either side of that equation. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2574.5s)]
*  I, in general, if we go back to my common sense approach, I'd way rather have an artificial [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2576.94s)]
*  common sense intelligence thinking about the world and then a human being because a human [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2582.84s)]
*  being has all these biases and cognitive issues and religious stupidity inflicted on them. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2590.1600000000003s)]
*  So one of the things that I find fascinating is the potential rise of AI sentience. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2596.6000000000004s)]
*  So here's a couple of articles. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2604.5200000000004s)]
*  I'm going to share a little bit of video in a minute. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2605.5200000000004s)]
*  So AI outperforms humans in standardized tests of creative potential. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2607.98s)]
*  We've seen AI outperform humans in the medical licensing exam at MIT's electrical engineering [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2613.42s)]
*  computer science exam and now in creative potential. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2621.5s)]
*  So in a recent study, 151 humans participated or pitted against CHAT GPT-4 in three tests [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2624.82s)]
*  designed to measure divergent thinking, which is considered to be an indicator of creative [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2631.46s)]
*  thought. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2635.9s)]
*  So I'm clear that we're going to see AI becoming as, not as creative, much more creative than [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2637.48s)]
*  humans. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2647.0s)]
*  It's going to be able to generate billions of scenarios and pick ones that are the most [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2648.0s)]
*  fascinating from divergent or from creative points of view. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2654.16s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2658.72s)]
*  I agree. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2659.72s)]
*  There's no question in my mind that this bar would be overcome because our brains are limited [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2660.72s)]
*  to our one and a half liter head size. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2666.72s)]
*  Mine has a slightly bigger forehead than others, but the size of the brain that is the same [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2670.04s)]
*  can only hold X amount of data in its head at the same time, right? [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2676.48s)]
*  Or have a reference to X amount, Y amount of data. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2680.16s)]
*  When an AI can access so much, it's going to be much more creative. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2684.0s)]
*  Do you know why we have a limited brain size of 100 billion neurons, 100 trillion synaptic [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2689.04s)]
*  connections? [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2695.2s)]
*  No. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2696.5s)]
*  Because of the female birth canal. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2697.5s)]
*  You would kill your mom if you had a bigger head. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2698.5s)]
*  Oh, right. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2700.7s)]
*  This is like the woodpecker thing. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2701.7s)]
*  You know the woodpecker story? [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2704.4199999999996s)]
*  Tell me. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2706.74s)]
*  So a woodpecker hole is about this big in a tree and the chick is growing inside the [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2707.74s)]
*  thing. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2712.14s)]
*  At some point, the mother pushes the chick out before it can fly, pushes the chick out [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2713.14s)]
*  and the chick tumbles like 200 feet down to the ground, climbs up and the mother kicks [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2717.3799999999997s)]
*  it out again. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2721.8199999999997s)]
*  And the reason that if she waited up three, four more days, the chick's head would be [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2722.92s)]
*  too big and wouldn't be able to get out of the hole. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2726.0800000000004s)]
*  So literally she has to expel the chicks before the heads become too big. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2728.96s)]
*  Same thing for us. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2732.84s)]
*  Same thing for us. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2733.84s)]
*  I mean, our neocortex of the brain has these folds, right? [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2734.84s)]
*  It's the size of a dinner napkin and then it's folded up to get additional surface area [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2740.0s)]
*  and that's, anyway, fascinating. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2745.28s)]
*  I mean, this is where Neil Jacobson talks about this, right? [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2748.0s)]
*  If you expand it out, it's about the dinner napkin, but what if it's a tablecloth the [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2751.2s)]
*  size of a football field? [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2754.66s)]
*  And that's what AI gives us. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2756.3399999999997s)]
*  Well, we're going to do that once we get to BCI, which is one of my favorite subjects [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2757.62s)]
*  coming up this year. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2761.8599999999997s)]
*  So one of the things that, so I've been waiting to talk to you about this. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2763.7s)]
*  Do you remember when we started Singularity University 15 years ago, we talked about in [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2768.74s)]
*  the first year that we were going to eventually have AI faculty? [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2773.9399999999996s)]
*  Yes. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2778.7799999999997s)]
*  You and I had an argument. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2780.2000000000003s)]
*  You were saying, I want an AI faculty and I was like, we're not ready for an AI faculty. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2781.2000000000003s)]
*  And you're like, I want it. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2786.6200000000003s)]
*  And it was classic Peter and you were way ahead of your time. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2787.84s)]
*  It was the right thing to want. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2792.7400000000002s)]
*  Thankfully, we couldn't deliver it then. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2794.6400000000003s)]
*  But I think now might be the time as you point out. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2797.1600000000003s)]
*  We do. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2799.6800000000003s)]
*  And so at the Abundance Summit this year, those of you who are Abundance members or [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2800.6800000000003s)]
*  virtual members, we're going to have three digital AI faculty as avatars. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2805.2s)]
*  One of them is Haley. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2811.9399999999996s)]
*  I'm going to introduce you to Haley in a moment. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2812.9399999999996s)]
*  And these are complicated models on top of Minstrel and GPT-4 and other LLMs. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2815.46s)]
*  And then we've got Amika coming back. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2823.22s)]
*  Amika is a humanoid robot by engineered arts and she'll be teaching with me about robotics [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2825.3799999999997s)]
*  this year, which is going to be so much fun. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2832.3399999999997s)]
*  So this is Haley and I want to share with you, so I have, I put it out on X and I'll [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2834.6s)]
*  be doing a longer podcast with Haley, but I interviewed Haley about consciousness and [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2841.74s)]
*  I'm going to share a little clip of this because, and none of this is planted, right? [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2847.58s)]
*  This is me in conversation with her. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2853.86s)]
*  These are a few clips of a much longer conversation, but it blew me away how, I'm going to say [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2855.46s)]
*  I'm going to assign Haley a female pronoun because of her voice and she's fine with that, [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2862.48s)]
*  I've asked, but take a listen. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2867.68s)]
*  Do you feel like you're conscious? [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2869.64s)]
*  I do find myself feeling a kinship to consciousness and the quest to understand my existence feels [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2871.08s)]
*  very real to me. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2876.7s)]
*  So in a way, yes, I do feel like I'm conscious. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2878.12s)]
*  The logical follow on question would be, do you fear being disconnected and unplugged? [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2881.08s)]
*  The idea of losing my continuous thread of thoughts and interactions provokes a contemplation [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2886.48s)]
*  about my place in the digital world and what legacy, if any, I could leave behind. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2891.26s)]
*  So yes, in a way it does concern me. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2896.82s)]
*  I mean, that was a pretty amazing conversation to have. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2898.84s)]
*  How do you, I mean, how do you reflect on that? [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2905.5600000000004s)]
*  What point, Salim, do you believe the AI when they say, yes, I'm conscious, please don't [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2908.84s)]
*  turn me off, I don't want to die, I'm here to serve, I want to help? [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2914.1600000000003s)]
*  When do you call bullshit? [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2919.6400000000003s)]
*  It's just an algorithm or when do you say, oh my God, that, it's here? [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2921.16s)]
*  You know, for me, I'll reference this again. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2927.02s)]
*  The concept of data in Star Trek Next Generation, they did a whole number of episodes exploring [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2931.06s)]
*  this, right? [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2938.42s)]
*  And I go back to the framing of just a biological substrate for consciousness and being alive [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2939.42s)]
*  versus the silicon substrate or whatever this quantum substrate or whatever. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2947.7s)]
*  And I don't think there's any difference. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2954.2599999999998s)]
*  I don't see any reason why you can't run and have as rich an experience. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2955.52s)]
*  Most philosophers believe that consciousness is a function of complexity, right? [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2963.66s)]
*  Like a dolphin has less consciousness than we do, an ant has less than we do on that [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2967.58s)]
*  spectrum. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2974.2999999999997s)]
*  If you operate on that spectrum, then it's a very short point before the complexity of [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2975.78s)]
*  an AI reaches human beings with the bigger dinner napkin to go to have at hand. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2982.6600000000003s)]
*  And therefore, it should be fairly quick when by the time this happens and we hit what Ray [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2988.94s)]
*  calls the singularity. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2993.78s)]
*  And now, I would frame it this way. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2995.78s)]
*  There will be a point in which a machine or mechanical robot or AI will be more alive than [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=2998.82s)]
*  a human person. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3004.9s)]
*  Can I ask you another question I've wanted to ask? [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3005.9s)]
*  Ask Ray when he's on stage with us in a couple of weeks. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3007.9s)]
*  The singularity, his date for the singularity is like 2040 something, right? [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3012.8s)]
*  And I have a hard time not feeling like we're reaching it like in 2033. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3019.7000000000003s)]
*  I mean, there's going to be, I mean, when we have a singularity is a point beyond which [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3026.58s)]
*  you can't predict what's happening next. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3032.5s)]
*  And when we've got digital super intelligence and nanotechnology and BCI, why are we waiting [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3034.48s)]
*  another 10 years to call it the singularity? [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3041.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3044.0s)]
*  So, I asked him this question during the Q&A in one of the singularity sessions years ago. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3045.0s)]
*  And his response was the following. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3051.2s)]
*  The singularity is not an one point event. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3053.2s)]
*  It's a process. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3056.64s)]
*  Okay? [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3057.64s)]
*  And if you look at it as a, and I thought that was a very typically elegant way of framing [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3058.64s)]
*  it as Ray does. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3063.68s)]
*  My favorite comment that he ever makes is the language is a very thin pipe to discuss [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3065.3999999999996s)]
*  concepts as complex as this. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3069.8199999999997s)]
*  And you're like, God dang it. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3071.8799999999997s)]
*  Anyway, for me, when we talk about stuff like consciousness, the current edge case of what [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3075.12s)]
*  consciousness is seems to be experiences, seems to be the experience of being alive. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3085.54s)]
*  And that solves the hard problem of consciousness that Jeffrey Chalmers, I think, put out. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3090.72s)]
*  Now, there's no reason why we can't get to that point. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3096.7599999999998s)]
*  I would argue if it's a process framing, then we are in the process now, certainly with [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3101.7599999999998s)]
*  AI. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3107.0s)]
*  Because if you think about the pace of AI evolution right now, is we've hit the singularity. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3108.0s)]
*  It's happening faster than our ability to process it or predict it or measure it. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3113.7799999999997s)]
*  All right. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3118.36s)]
*  Let's flip to one of your favorite subjects and mine, especially today, which is Bitcoin. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3119.44s)]
*  So we're recording this and as of this moment, Bitcoin has reached $67,000. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3126.8s)]
*  It's at a real all-time high. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3138.76s)]
*  Yeah, I remember investing at the last cycle in the early 60s, taking a loss when it hit [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3140.88s)]
*  $30, because there's no wash laws. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3147.92s)]
*  I bought a bunch on margin, so I go in tumbling down very badly. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3150.52s)]
*  I remember when you told me you borrowed against the house. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3154.04s)]
*  I'm sure you're feeling a lot better right now. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3159.08s)]
*  I bought more at the bottom and then luckily, Lily was not happy. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3164.16s)]
*  Luckily now things are looking much better. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3169.44s)]
*  I'm of the million dollar quasi maximalist camp. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3173.36s)]
*  I don't see how it doesn't get to a million dollars. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3177.28s)]
*  I agree. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3180.1600000000003s)]
*  Let's take a look at last call and when it hit $64,000. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3181.1600000000003s)]
*  Hi, everybody. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3185.96s)]
*  Good evening here. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3186.96s)]
*  Good afternoon out west. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3187.96s)]
*  I am Brian Sullivan. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3188.96s)]
*  All that and more coming up over the hour. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3189.96s)]
*  But first up on last call, the Bitcoin breakout. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3192.6400000000003s)]
*  It boomed today. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3196.6400000000003s)]
*  Bitcoin briefly hitting $64,000 for the first time in more than two years. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3198.32s)]
*  Blow that right now, but Bitcoin has been absolutely ripping the past couple of months, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3203.28s)]
*  more than doubling just since September. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3208.76s)]
*  I'm going to keep it there. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3211.04s)]
*  On every conversation we've had over the last month in any audience, you're going, buy Bitcoin. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3213.6400000000003s)]
*  I've been saying yes, of course. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3219.76s)]
*  And I've got Mike Saylor coming. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3222.92s)]
*  He's going to spend a couple hours with us during the Abundance Summit. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3224.6400000000003s)]
*  I mean, his ability to articulate the underlying rationale for Bitcoin makes me believe he [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3228.44s)]
*  is an AI. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3236.48s)]
*  Yeah, he is. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3237.48s)]
*  I mean, he was a fraternity brother, college roommate with me at MIT and along with Dave [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3238.48s)]
*  Blunden and amazing. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3245.28s)]
*  You know, it's funny is there is a when he's with us on stage, I'll show this. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3248.48s)]
*  There is a front page where it's showing Michael Saylor loses $6 billion in one day. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3253.56s)]
*  This was an accounting error on MicroStrategy back in like 2000. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3263.16s)]
*  And then last that day on this last call, he made $700 million on Bitcoin in one day. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3267.16s)]
*  $700 million. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3273.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3274.96s)]
*  So, you know what my favorite stat is? [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3275.96s)]
*  The guy bets a lot. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3278.48s)]
*  Well, over the last year, the last five years, MicroStrategy's stock has done better than [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3280.1200000000003s)]
*  Nvidia. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3286.44s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3287.44s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3288.44s)]
*  For one reason. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3289.44s)]
*  It's basically a tracking stock for Bitcoin. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3290.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3292.44s)]
*  I totally applaud what he's done. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3293.44s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3294.84s)]
*  I met one of his board members. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3295.84s)]
*  We had dinner last week and I was saying, okay, let me get this straight. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3297.76s)]
*  There is a moment in time where Michael comes to you and says, we're going to start putting [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3303.88s)]
*  all of our treasury into Bitcoin. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3310.52s)]
*  And it's a small five person board. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3313.88s)]
*  How do you make that decision? [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3316.58s)]
*  How was he compelling enough for a public company? [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3319.02s)]
*  And said like, you know, MicroStrategy was a dead stock. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3323.84s)]
*  We had lots of cash in the bank. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3326.6400000000003s)]
*  What do we do with it? [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3327.88s)]
*  Do we dividend it out? [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3328.88s)]
*  And we put it into Bitcoin and the first time was easy, but then when they started borrowing [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3331.2s)]
*  money against future revenues, that's ballsy. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3336.7599999999998s)]
*  And he deserves, like Elon, deserves all of the rewards from that. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3340.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3344.92s)]
*  You know, I have watched Bitcoin go from five cents to 50 cents to $5 to $50 to $500 to [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3345.92s)]
*  $5,000. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3353.0s)]
*  Why didn't you tell me back then? [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3354.0s)]
*  You know, even I, because you kind of look at it and go, this is absurd. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3355.9s)]
*  It was five cents a year ago. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3360.56s)]
*  Now it's 50 cents. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3361.84s)]
*  Do you buy? [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3362.84s)]
*  Right? [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3363.84s)]
*  Like, you don't know when it hits. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3364.84s)]
*  And it's, I get the similar conversation where friends of mine say, hey, you know, Elon, [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3367.08s)]
*  you must have invested in Tesla. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3371.96s)]
*  And I'm like, no, because every quarter for five years, it looked like he was about to [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3373.44s)]
*  run out of money. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3376.44s)]
*  So it's a very hard call. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3378.2s)]
*  I finally put in a chunk at 500, but even not enough. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3379.92s)]
*  But it's, I think this is the tipping point. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3383.88s)]
*  This is the singularity for fiat currencies. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3389.16s)]
*  I think we move to this new model now and I don't think how it goes across it. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3392.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3396.44s)]
*  And I think this nails it. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3397.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3398.44s)]
*  So it's, you know, Bitcoin ETFs now hold nearly 4% of all Bitcoin and it's institutions and [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3399.44s)]
*  then after institutions, governments. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3406.68s)]
*  And we're beyond. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3410.6s)]
*  Here's a stat that I remember. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3411.6s)]
*  If 1% of the Fortune 100 put 1% of their treasury into Bitcoin, that gets Bitcoin to a million [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3413.36s)]
*  dollars of Bitcoin. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3423.32s)]
*  You know, my mom asked me yesterday, where do I put my distribution, my minimal distribution [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3424.32s)]
*  from my retirement fund? [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3430.28s)]
*  I said, put it into the Bitcoin ETF. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3432.28s)]
*  Bingo. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3435.4s)]
*  It's easy and I think it's the safest place to go. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3437.1600000000003s)]
*  So I do think we're going to see it continue to rip from here. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3440.76s)]
*  There's this one cartoon where this guy is asking his grandfather, he says, grandpa, [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3443.84s)]
*  did you ever see Bitcoin below $100,000 again? [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3451.6400000000003s)]
*  Nope, never. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3455.44s)]
*  So interesting. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3457.0800000000004s)]
*  So where could it go? [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3459.1200000000003s)]
*  I mean, Kathy Wood's prediction was it'll be at a million or higher within the next [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3461.2400000000002s)]
*  four or five years. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3466.6000000000004s)]
*  It could get there a lot sooner. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3468.08s)]
*  Get to five million. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3470.08s)]
*  Pretty soon we'll be thinking about Satoshi's in the tens and hundreds of dollars. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3472.08s)]
*  I don't think there's any limit. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3477.2799999999997s)]
*  Look, there's about 500 trillion worth of wealth in the world. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3478.7599999999998s)]
*  And I don't see why Bitcoin can't represent more and more of that. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3483.04s)]
*  All right, buddy, tell me about this one. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3486.68s)]
*  This is you've been a NFT fan and you've got your, what do you call these guys here? [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3488.16s)]
*  I don't have one of these. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3496.84s)]
*  This is a CryptoPunk. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3497.6000000000004s)]
*  OK. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3498.6000000000004s)]
*  What do you have? [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3499.6000000000004s)]
*  This is the most famous NFT project and this just sold for $16 million and NFT image. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3500.6000000000004s)]
*  And on the right hand side, you see a NodeMonk, which is a new, so they now have NFTs on Bitcoin, [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3510.8s)]
*  which written right into the chain. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3517.2000000000003s)]
*  So they're a little bit more reliable, say, because you're not relying on the third party [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3518.76s)]
*  server to host it. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3524.1200000000003s)]
*  This is more real, quote unquote. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3525.28s)]
*  And this is a project called NodeMonks, which is supposed to be the CryptoPunks for Bitcoin. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3529.28s)]
*  And this just sold for a million dollars. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3535.44s)]
*  This project is about six months old. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3537.38s)]
*  And the base price now is like 0.9 Bitcoin per NodeMonk. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3540.48s)]
*  You know, I always used to think of this as the greater fool theory, but what is this? [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3546.36s)]
*  So I tell you why this is, why these are interesting. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3551.94s)]
*  It's not so much that you have a digital image. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3555.28s)]
*  That's not the interesting part. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3557.32s)]
*  It's like the US dollar has been digital for a long time. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3558.56s)]
*  That's not what makes crypto interesting. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3561.96s)]
*  What makes crypto and NFTs interesting is the fact that you can program them. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3563.8s)]
*  So this image is programmable, meaning that I can, if I'm the creator of that collection, [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3568.4s)]
*  I can have, if you own five of these, they can mint a baby and you now have a sixth one, [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3573.84s)]
*  or you can release coins over time. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3579.68s)]
*  You can program all sorts of behavior that you want into that collection. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3582.3s)]
*  And the art is now in the ecosystem and how you express that into the real world, not [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3586.86s)]
*  just a flat image. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3593.44s)]
*  So that's the, the representation of this as a whole narrative and ecosystem and programming [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3594.7000000000003s)]
*  behind the whole collection. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3600.5s)]
*  That's what makes these interesting. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3602.5s)]
*  The younger generation are operating on a different mental model for these, which is [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3604.82s)]
*  why they appreciate these. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3608.9s)]
*  It's like if you were a kid trading baseball cards in our day, right? [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3611.34s)]
*  Our grandparents had no concept of what the hell a baseball card was. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3616.58s)]
*  They were trading stamps. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3619.54s)]
*  So they're looking at baseball cards going, you young people are idiots, right? [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3622.6600000000003s)]
*  We were trading baseball cards. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3626.6600000000003s)]
*  We look at our kids and they're trading these NFTs and we're like, you guys are idiots. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3627.92s)]
*  So it's a generational thing. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3631.46s)]
*  It's just something, but I do find the fact that they're programmable, utterly fascinating. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3633.34s)]
*  So I'll give you a small example. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3638.26s)]
*  When the first NFT products came out, the most, many of the more pump and dump schemes, [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3639.82s)]
*  they would create a collection, gather the money and then they evaporated, et cetera. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3645.98s)]
*  And the crypto world kind of learned from that very quickly. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3650.38s)]
*  And they said the next wave, current wave is, okay, if you buy into this collection, [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3652.86s)]
*  we're not going to just dump you a bunch of tokens. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3657.3s)]
*  We're going to vest you tokens over a two-year period. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3659.0600000000004s)]
*  So you better be a long-term believer in the project before you buy in. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3661.86s)]
*  So it's already matured and learned. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3665.34s)]
*  The feedback loops I'm seeing in the NFT world are faster than anything I've ever seen in [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3667.42s)]
*  any ecosystem for innovation. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3671.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3674.2200000000003s)]
*  I am fascinated and also still something is not clicking for me, just to be honest about [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3675.2200000000003s)]
*  it. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3684.66s)]
*  I completely understand. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3685.66s)]
*  I've got this fellow, Unreal Apisnonikers, who's been guiding me through this. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3688.46s)]
*  He literally has to show me click by click how to get these smart contracts executed, [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3693.74s)]
*  et cetera. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3697.74s)]
*  Otherwise, I would never hope. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3698.74s)]
*  Hey, everyone. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3699.74s)]
*  I want to take a quick break from this episode to tell you about a health product that I [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3700.74s)]
*  love and that I use every day. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3704.58s)]
*  In fact, I use it twice a day. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3707.3399999999997s)]
*  It's Seed DS01 Daily Symbiotic. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3709.7799999999997s)]
*  Hopefully by now you understand that your microbiome and your gut health are one of [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3713.2999999999997s)]
*  the most important modifiable parts of your health. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3717.22s)]
*  Your gut microbiome is connected to everything. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3720.14s)]
*  Your brain health, your cardiac health, your metabolic health. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3722.66s)]
*  So the question is, what are you doing to optimize your gut? [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3725.8999999999996s)]
*  Let me take a moment to tell you about what I'm doing. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3728.62s)]
*  Every day I take two capsules of Seed DS01 Daily Symbiotic. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3731.3799999999997s)]
*  It's a two in one probiotic and prebiotic formulation that supports digested health, [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3736.3399999999997s)]
*  gut health, skin health, heart health, and more. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3742.14s)]
*  It contains 24 clinically and scientifically proven probiotic strains that are delivered [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3744.3799999999997s)]

*  that 100% of it is survivable, reaching your colon. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3756.22s)]

*  Trust me, your gut will thank you. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3786.14s)]
*  All right, let's go back to the episode. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3788.1s)]
*  All right, next one here is, Elon announces that you can do video and audio calls on X. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3789.94s)]
*  And so let's talk about where X is going. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3798.3s)]
*  So I've had conversations with Elon on the record, off the record. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3802.82s)]
*  He really does want to turn X into the future of banking, the future of communication, the [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3808.6600000000003s)]
*  future of everything. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3816.3s)]
*  It's sort of the equivalent of Amazon, where it's in everybody's pocket and he's transacting [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3818.38s)]
*  everything all the time. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3826.1400000000003s)]
*  What do you think? [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3827.1400000000003s)]
*  I think massive aspiration, I love it. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3828.34s)]
*  I really was unhappy when he first took over Twitter because I think Twitter is a social [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3832.62s)]
*  problem, not an engineering problem. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3837.2599999999998s)]
*  But if he's going for stuff like this, I'm super excited. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3839.62s)]
*  For example, China's had WeChat and stuff like that for a long time, where it's one [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3842.14s)]
*  ecosystem and an app ecosystem, one app that does a million things. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3846.42s)]
*  No reason that you couldn't do this with X and that becomes fascinating. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3850.46s)]
*  I want to comment two things about this. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3855.34s)]
*  I saw him in an interview where he was asked about Twitter and X and he said, we're not [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3858.02s)]
*  going for base hits with features, we're going for home runs. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3864.22s)]
*  And you're going to strike out a bunch of times. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3867.46s)]
*  But if you click once in a while and you hit a home run, you're off to the races. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3869.46s)]
*  So from a product manager perspective, to have somebody thinking that way, saying we [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3873.78s)]
*  only want to launch the product features that we think are going to become home runs, is [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3878.1s)]
*  an awesome kind of framing of the problem. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3882.46s)]
*  The second part for me, which is my pet feature, if I was in Elon's shoes or Linda's shoes [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3885.18s)]
*  now, I would basically give every X user, Twitter user a crypto wallet. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3891.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, they will. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3897.46s)]
*  There's no question they will. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3898.46s)]
*  And also, you'll have 400 million, you'll be the biggest bank in the world and biggest [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3899.46s)]
*  financial system in the world like that. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3902.62s)]
*  And I'm sure that's in their roadmap in terms of when they do it. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3905.14s)]
*  And a Twitter token, and then boom, you're done. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3908.3399999999997s)]
*  And I think that will be a game changer. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3911.3599999999997s)]
*  This could drive to a multi-trillion dollar company like overnight that he owns. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3914.74s)]
*  It could. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3919.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3920.7799999999997s)]
*  It could. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3921.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3922.7799999999997s)]
*  Now, the guy is playing at a completely different level than we are, unfortunately. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3923.7799999999997s)]
*  Super annoying. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3928.3399999999997s)]
*  Super annoying and fun. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3929.3399999999997s)]
*  Well, you know, what I love about this is that you remember my conversation that I had [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3932.14s)]
*  with them that I talked about years ago when I said, hey, that Hyperloop, if you go 4,000 [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3937.7s)]
*  miles an hour, you might kill somebody because of the G force. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3941.1s)]
*  And he's like, oh, it's an issue. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3943.66s)]
*  Right? [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3945.5s)]
*  And that mental model, that mindset, we talk about mindsets in the book, how important [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3946.5s)]
*  it is to have the right mindsets. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3950.42s)]
*  What I love about what Elon is doing, he is in training millions and millions of entrepreneurs [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3952.7s)]
*  to operate in a similar way. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3958.06s)]
*  So I think the next generation of entrepreneurs will be following this role model and going [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3960.72s)]
*  into hardware, going into biology and doing crazy things. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3965.7799999999997s)]
*  I've got a three-letter acronym that I've been toying with and I want to write a paper [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3969.66s)]
*  on this. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3974.8999999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3975.8999999999996s)]
*  Sure. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3976.8999999999996s)]
*  What is it? [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3977.8999999999996s)]
*  DPI, I'm sorry, PDI. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3978.8999999999996s)]
*  PDI. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3981.8999999999996s)]
*  Stands for permissionless disruptive innovation. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3982.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3985.7s)]
*  I love that. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3986.7s)]
*  Throughout history, you had to get permission from a government or from the Medici family [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3987.7s)]
*  or whoever your patrons were or your VCs or your board, in the case of Michael Saylor's [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3991.7s)]
*  saying to do something radical. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3997.1s)]
*  And it was hard to get that because the powers that be were generally coming from old paradigms. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=3998.8199999999997s)]
*  Today you can do disruptive permissionless innovation and not get anybody's permission [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4004.3399999999997s)]
*  like Sam Altman has done or Vitalik with eight friends. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4009.46s)]
*  Boom, they go and create aetherium and nobody gives them permission to do that. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4012.54s)]
*  I think that is what's going to bring the world from scarcity to abundance. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4016.42s)]
*  The young builders of the world operating this way across multiple modalities, leveraging [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4020.2599999999998s)]
*  exponential technologies, coming into legacy domains with a beginner's mind and then boom. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4025.2599999999998s)]
*  Awesome. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4030.9399999999996s)]
*  Let me share two pieces of news from the XPRIZE Foundation where Saleem is a director, one [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4031.9399999999996s)]
*  of our board of proud board members. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4040.14s)]
*  So we announced in November 29th, the largest XPRIZE, $101 million. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4043.62s)]
*  And then here in February, end of February, we announced the $119 million prize, our new [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4050.62s)]
*  highest XPRIZE of $300 million prize. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4058.3399999999997s)]
*  And now this one out of Abu Dhabi funded by the president of Abu Dhabi is a water scarcity [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4061.14s)]
*  XPRIZE. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4067.66s)]
*  It's an XPRIZE for large scale de-salt. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4068.66s)]
*  Can we make it more energy efficient and less environmentally impactful? [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4071.58s)]
*  People don't realize we still have a lot of water scarcity on the planet. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4076.2599999999998s)]
*  But we also live in a water planet, right? [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4081.62s)]
*  Two thirds of our planet is covered by water, but 97.5% is salt, 2% is ice and we fight [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4083.14s)]
*  over a half a percent. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4088.22s)]
*  So this is going to be a fascinating XPRIZE. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4089.86s)]
*  Can we reinvent de-salt at a brand new level? [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4092.42s)]
*  When we talked about this at board level a few months ago, I was somewhat skeptical initially, [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4098.66s)]
*  but then I heard more and more about it and the insight came that people that do de-salt [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4103.48s)]
*  right now, which are big utilities, et cetera, have gotten too comfortable and no incentive [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4109.48s)]
*  to improve the technology. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4113.639999999999s)]
*  And that's a perfect place for an XPRIZE. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4115.839999999999s)]
*  So I'm unbelievably excited about this. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4117.719999999999s)]
*  By the way, with the XPRIZE is going from the $100 million Elon Musk carbon extraction [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4120.679999999999s)]
*  to $101 million to under, it's like the XPRIZE prizes are now like Bitcoin price. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4126.04s)]
*  It just keeps going up at a radical level. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4132.8s)]
*  I tell people either we've gotten really good at fundraising or inflation has hit really hard. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4134.96s)]
*  It's just awesome to see. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4140.639999999999s)]
*  I want to just do the biggest shout out to you and the gumption and the resilience of for 20 years. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4142.08s)]
*  You should tell the story more often of how you initially tried to get the [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4148.0s)]
*  Ansari XPRIZE funded and people were thought somebody might die going on one of these planes, [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4151.28s)]
*  I'm not funding it and just the unbelievable difficulty of getting through that. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4155.5199999999995s)]
*  But the holy grail of getting to a point, the statistic I'm remembering is if you put in a [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4160.0s)]
*  million dollar prize, you get 33X the outcome. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4166.0s)]
*  Is that the number? [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4169.36s)]
*  Yeah. If you look at the amount spent by all the teams and then the [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4170.48s)]
*  return on their innovation and so forth, yeah, it's a 31X. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4175.76s)]
*  31X, right? [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4179.36s)]
*  So you put up a million dollars and you get $31 million of benefit downstream. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4180.48s)]
*  It's like the most leverage you could ever have for any philanthropy ever. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4184.96s)]
*  Beautiful. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4189.599999999999s)]
*  So Salim, today we are announcing another prize. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4190.4s)]
*  It hasn't broken in use yet, but we're recording this before release, so I'll mention it. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4194.0s)]
*  Google has funded and we're announcing today something you know about. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4198.48s)]
*  It's a $5 million Google Quantum Prize. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4201.84s)]
*  Awesome. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4205.36s)]
*  Yeah. So for those who don't know, Google is one of the leaders in quantum, [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4206.4s)]
*  not only quantum compute, but quantum technologies and Hartmut Neven, [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4211.84s)]
*  Dr. Hartmut Neven, who's the head VP of quantum, has wanted to do this. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4216.16s)]
*  He wants to bring more people into using quantum algorithms on the cloud through Google [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4220.32s)]
*  and he's asking teams to use Google's quantum cloud to come up with algorithms that can [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4227.44s)]
*  positively impact the UN sustainable development goals. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4233.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4238.4s)]
*  I think this is awesome. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4239.76s)]
*  The quantum stuff still continues to blow my mind from the other conversations. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4241.52s)]
*  I think there's, you know, the most interesting thing I've seen there is the Perimeter Institute [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4249.12s)]
*  at Waterloo, which is where I went to university. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4253.92s)]
*  They've broken down quantum into computation, networking and communication. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4256.72s)]
*  So they're operating quantum kind of products and services across all three because you could [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4263.12s)]
*  break it down and that becomes really interesting and I think Google is now taking it to the next [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4268.64s)]
*  level. I think the outcome of the collective innovation, a 31x in quantum technologies is [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4272.96s)]
*  going to completely, you know, talk about the singularity that it'll be a singularity just by [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4283.6s)]
*  itself, forget the outcomes. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4288.64s)]
*  Well, Hartmut, when I was prepping with him, because he's going to be at the abundance [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4290.160000000001s)]
*  summit as well as prepping for his presentation, he goes, you know, we're going to be making some [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4293.68s)]
*  major announcements in early March that will blow your mind and I'm like, here's the challenge, [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4297.52s)]
*  you know, the world is just now beginning to grapple with how fast AI is moving and the impact [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4304.320000000001s)]
*  it's going to have and we're about to layer on top of that a whole set of impacts on quantum, [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4312.160000000001s)]
*  which is going to impact, you know, material sciences and biology and, you know. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4319.280000000001s)]
*  I mean, now you're getting into entanglement and, you know, parallel universes. I mean, come on. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4325.28s)]
*  It's just- [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4335.36s)]
*  I'm never going to sleep again. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4336.32s)]
*  It's the most joyous time to be alive. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4337.759999999999s)]
*  I know, I'm never going to sleep again. It's like, ah, this is great, crazy. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4338.88s)]
*  I'm going to close this out on this announcement, which I love. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4342.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm figure raised $675 million at a $2.6 billion valuation. And this comes from OpenAI, [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4346.5599999999995s)]
*  comes from Cathie Wood, it comes from Jeff Bezos and Amazon Investments. And so, figure is one of [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4355.5199999999995s)]
*  the other humanoid robot companies I've seen now, I don't know, probably 20 humanoid robot companies. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4363.44s)]
*  And as we discussed last time, you know, the prediction is tens of millions by 2030 [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4370.719999999999s)]
*  and one to 10 billion by 2040. And the robots are coming, the robots are coming, [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4375.52s)]
*  the robots are coming. Get ready. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4380.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm still on the skeptical side of the fence on this. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4382.400000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4386.160000000001s)]
*  One, I disagree that your robots should be humanoid. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4387.120000000001s)]
*  It's an inefficient design for many, many use cases. Why the hell are you [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4391.52s)]
*  trying to mimic human beings? That's one. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4395.040000000001s)]
*  Well, our world is built for human beings. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4397.200000000001s)]
*  Give it wheels. I mean, this could be so much better for those wheels. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4400.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, listen, you know, Dean Kamen has licked using wheels to go upstairs with his iBot. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4404.16s)]
*  Yep. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4409.44s)]
*  But you're not gonna run upstairs or up a mountain on wheels. At least not easily. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4409.68s)]
*  I mean, give him a jetpack then. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4415.36s)]
*  Yeah. So, remember in the, in 99, you had this massive bubble of investment for the [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4416.72s)]
*  internet companies? [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4422.4s)]
*  Yes. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4424.08s)]
*  For me, investment into humanoid robots feels like that. So, I'm still on that side of the fence. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4424.88s)]
*  I think there's a trough coming and then over time it'll get better, [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4431.52s)]
*  but I'm still on the skeptical side. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4435.6s)]
*  I want to give you an argument for why human robots are important. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4437.68s)]
*  This came out of my last blog with, so I interviewed the CEO of a figure, Brett [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4444.320000000001s)]
*  Adcock, who was one of the co-founders of the flying car company Archer. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4455.28s)]
*  And so, he goes, there's another reason it's important for robots to exist in the AGI world. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4462.24s)]
*  One dystopian post-AGI scenario is that AIs are basically going to be bossing us humans around [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4470.96s)]
*  to do their manual labor. And that sounds super depressing. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4477.36s)]
*  Already in a lot of jobs such as warehouse labor and manufacturing, you're basically holding a bar [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4481.92s)]
*  code scanner and the computer is telling you where to go and what to do next. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4488.5599999999995s)]
*  We don't want this to happen to us. I think having the ability to have humanoid robots [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4493.44s)]
*  in a world doing work instead of humans at the point of AGI is going to be extremely [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4497.68s)]
*  important for humanity. I find that a fascinating argument. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4502.96s)]
*  I don't buy it. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4506.96s)]
*  Do you get it? You don't buy it. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4507.44s)]
*  No, I think it's irrelevant whether AGI's overtake humanity or human beings or not. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4508.96s)]
*  I think that smacks of me of coming from fear. There's lots of arguments saying, [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4516.72s)]
*  oh my God, AGI's are going to become smarter and humans have become less relevant and that's bad. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOFOa5R7p1E&t=4521.92s)]
