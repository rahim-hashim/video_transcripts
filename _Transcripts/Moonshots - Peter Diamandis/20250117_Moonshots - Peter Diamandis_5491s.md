*  Mary Lou, I cannot tell you how excited I am about this podcast. You know, you are [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=204.68s)]
*  an extraordinary entrepreneur, technologist and disruptor. And I want [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=210.28s)]
*  the world to know what you're doing because you're about to change health care [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=217.08s)]
*  for for decades ahead. And so thank you for taking the time. I want to go deep [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=222.2s)]
*  with you. I want to talk about how you're reinventing health care, how you're [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=227.72s)]
*  using exponential technologies to transform our lives. Honestly, how you're [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=232.12s)]
*  making the impossible possible. So thanks for the time today. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=237.64s)]
*  Thanks for having me. And I'm so excited to show everybody what we've been doing [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  through pandemic, because it's been a lot and I really we're going to unveil [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=244.84s)]
*  some stuff today that no one's seen. Yeah, you've been for featuring us. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=248.51999999999998s)]
*  You're welcome. You've been on an incredible mission. I mean, you have had [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=252.16s)]
*  incredible positions around the world, right? If I were to lay it out, you know, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=258.64s)]
*  you were at a few different tech giants, Google and Facebook, the head of [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=263.76s)]
*  engineering there, the Intel CTO, you were reinventing everything from [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=270.44s)]
*  holography to VR screens. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=275.88s)]
*  I mean, you ran the largest consumer product development ever. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=279.76s)]
*  And you gave that up. You transformed yourself from that into what? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=286.56s)]
*  What what's your mission and passion today? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=291.4s)]
*  Using all the stuff that's coming down the pike for next generation consumer [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=295.32s)]
*  electronics via VR, AR, LIDAR, and using the fact that both infrared light, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=300.04s)]
*  ultrasound and electromagnetic penetrate our body. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=306.64s)]
*  And with the manipulation we can now do using Moore's law, exponential reduction [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=310.8s)]
*  in feature size, we can make devices. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=316.6s)]
*  This is why I started this company close to 10 years ago called Open Water. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=319.72s)]
*  We're going to talk about it today. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=323.56s)]
*  Using these principles, I thought that maybe we could affect on a cellular [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=324.64s)]
*  level disease states like kill the cancer cells without killing the healthy [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=329.6s)]
*  tissue, fix the stroke, fix the neurodegenerative disease. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=335.72s)]
*  And now it's really eight years into this, feels like 10, though. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=340.6s)]
*  We have pretty strong results and we're about to scale out and go into [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=345.4s)]
*  production of devices anybody can buy to push this research forward. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=349.24s)]
*  In a whole set of disease states, including pathogen deactivation like [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=353.52000000000004s)]
*  COVID or other diseases. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=358.20000000000005s)]
*  So for anybody listening, what we're about to go on is a journey, a revolutionary [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=359.72s)]
*  journey on how the technologies that Mary Lou has been pulling together. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=366.56s)]
*  These are converging exponentials. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=373.16s)]
*  This is the intersection of physics and AI and chipsets that's turning [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=375.24s)]
*  what was once huge, bulky, expensive equipment into software, into different [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=381.76s)]
*  therapeutics that are, you know, I talk about the six D's, Mary Lou, that when [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=391.84s)]
*  you digitize something, dematerializes, demonetizes, and it democratizes. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=397.11999999999995s)]
*  And that's exactly what you're doing to, you know, so we say billions of dollars [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=404.4s)]
*  worth of healthcare tech. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=409.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=411.52s)]
*  I mean, this laser, for example, was the size of a room and a million dollars. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=412.2s)]
*  And this is allowing us with camera chips in your smartphone to see blood flow [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=417.12s)]
*  20 times better than a multimillion dollar MRI machine or CT machine or anything [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=422.04s)]
*  else we can find published in the literature. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=426.0s)]
*  It literally makes holograms. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=428.15999999999997s)]
*  It records the phase of light. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=429.8s)]
*  Here's the eight camera chips, the lasers in there. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=433.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=436.8s)]
*  And it records the phase of light because the chips in your smartphone are so small [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=437.12s)]
*  that the pixels are the size of the wavelength of light, which means we can [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=441.52s)]
*  record the waves and the waves of light. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=445.52s)]
*  And there's information in that. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=447.03999999999996s)]
*  And with that information, with this laser we made, this goes into production [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=448.71999999999997s)]
*  like literally next month, but we already have been in hospitals for [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=454.0s)]
*  four years with this technology. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=457.52s)]
*  So this is just one of the kind of modules we're getting out to everybody. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=459.79999999999995s)]
*  I want to go into this technology, but I guess I want to preface this. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=464.20000000000005s)]
*  If you've ever had anybody for our viewers and listeners, ever had anybody [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=467.8s)]
*  who has had a debilitating stroke, which is the second leading cause of death [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=474.04s)]
*  in the world, if you've ever had anybody with mental disease or addictions, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=479.96000000000004s)]
*  or have had anybody who has an aggressive cancer, you know, you know, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=484.84000000000003s)]
*  an aggressive cancer, like a glioblastoma, the work that you're doing is the chance [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=492.44s)]
*  to provide not just treatments, but effectively cures for these things. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=500.12s)]
*  Potentially a cure. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=505.96s)]
*  I mean, we have results just from this week, looking at amyloid microplex [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=507.4s)]
*  with ultrasound at certain frequencies. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=512.4399999999999s)]
*  And one of the issues is that the microplex are too big to go through capillaries. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=515.0799999999999s)]
*  So it kills off whatever is close to the capillaries that get clogged up [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=521.36s)]
*  with these microclots. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=526.92s)]
*  It happens with aging. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=527.76s)]
*  It happens in neurodegenerative disease. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=529.6s)]
*  It happens with acute COVID. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=531.36s)]
*  It happens with type two diabetes. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=532.96s)]
*  We're clearing 80% of them and we're reducing the size from an eight micron [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=535.64s)]
*  diameter to a four micron diameter. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=541.72s)]
*  And that's a really big deal because capillaries are five to 10 microns wide. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=543.88s)]
*  And so if it's eight, it may not get through. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=549.52s)]
*  If it's bigger, it can't get through. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=552.0799999999999s)]
*  It's clogged. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=553.48s)]
*  And so the potential is very strong. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=554.84s)]
*  Again, this is just lab work we're doing, but what we're looking at doing is [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=556.36s)]
*  basically taking something like this, putting it behind your knee. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=560.8s)]
*  And you're holding up something the size of a cigarette pack, basically. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=563.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=567.4s)]
*  So this, in it has a transducer, an ultrasound transducer. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=567.96s)]
*  That's an eight by eight array. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=574.52s)]
*  And we're able to focus wherever we want to using antenna theory, but we're able [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=576.68s)]
*  to make resonant frequencies that allow us to selectively attack the microclots. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=583.4399999999999s)]
*  Like an opera singer can stimulate or even break a wine glass, but harm [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=592.0s)]
*  nothing else on the room when she sings. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=597.92s)]
*  So I want to slow this down. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=600.88s)]
*  By the way, this is a diagnostic level of ultrasound. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=602.16s)]
*  So yes, you want to slow it down. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=605.2s)]
*  I want to slow it down for everybody because there's so much here, but what [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=606.5600000000001s)]
*  you're about to hear is what I think is the most important revolution in health [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=610.76s)]
*  care that we're going to see over the next few years with a chance to really [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=615.92s)]
*  democratize this at a extraordinarily affordable cost. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=621.6s)]
*  I mean, this is, and I'll ask everybody to put in the comments here. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=626.8s)]
*  If you agree, this is so revolutionary that I want to get your name out there [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=632.64s)]
*  before you win your Nobel prize. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=637.84s)]
*  So people know about this. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=639.48s)]
*  So I want to start. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=642.56s)]
*  The goal is to change health care. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=644.64s)]
*  I know it is. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=645.9599999999999s)]
*  And put it on this track of other things. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=646.92s)]
*  The 20 to 40 year motes are anti-innovation for the thing that kills us. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=649.84s)]
*  And we got to speed it up. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=656.4399999999999s)]
*  And yes, we've got great technology. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=658.68s)]
*  I think the business model we're using to speed it up is even more compelling. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=660.6s)]
*  And we want to bring other technologies into this suite so we can do more. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=664.4399999999999s)]
*  And we'll get there. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=668.04s)]
*  So I want to tell your story to begin with. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=668.84s)]
*  You're a brain tumor survivor. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=673.3199999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=675.72s)]
*  How much of that is your motivation? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=676.28s)]
*  You mind telling that story? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=679.0s)]
*  And where does it begin? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=681.24s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=683.36s)]
*  I was a kid. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=685.2s)]
*  I was pretty sick and in the hospital a lot. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=686.2s)]
*  And that got me really good at being on time because I knew I likely end up in the hospital. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=688.28s)]
*  Anyway, I was finally diagnosed. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=694.32s)]
*  I dropped out of my PhD in physics in Ivy League school because I was in a wheelchair. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=696.16s)]
*  I was really sick. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=701.36s)]
*  I couldn't move half my face. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=702.24s)]
*  I was sleeping 20 hours a day. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=704.64s)]
*  But then it got really bad because I couldn't even subtract. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=706.64s)]
*  And so I didn't think I deserved a PhD in physics from Ivy League school. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=710.0s)]
*  I had already worked. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=714.4s)]
*  I'd been a computer science professor. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=716.0s)]
*  I had a degree from MIT. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=717.92s)]
*  I was at Brown doing my PhD. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=719.6s)]
*  And I called up my parents and asked them if I could come home and die. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=722.24s)]
*  Because Brown had a medical school. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=728.88s)]
*  They let me see the professors there. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=731.36s)]
*  No one could figure out what I had. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=733.28s)]
*  This is 1995-ish. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=735.12s)]
*  But as I was headed out, this professor said, you've got really bad headaches, right? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=737.8399999999999s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, very bad headaches. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=742.7199999999999s)]
*  So he sprung for the cost of an MRI. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=746.9599999999999s)]
*  They found my tumor. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=749.04s)]
*  No, MRIs back then. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=749.92s)]
*  Let's describe what an MRI was for comparison because this is part... [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=751.76s)]
*  Exactly the same size and shape. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=755.36s)]
*  It's just 10 times more expensive today. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=757.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's a giant... [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=759.8399999999999s)]
*  Best they called it Moore's law, which is Moore's law spelled backwards. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=760.48s)]
*  It's a giant room. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=764.5600000000001s)]
*  I would say it's like 20 by 20 foot minimum shielded in an electric cage [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=766.24s)]
*  with a large electromagnet and helium cooling. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=773.36s)]
*  A power center. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=778.72s)]
*  The most expensive room in hospitals and also the highest margin. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=780.1600000000001s)]
*  90% gross margin. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=783.6s)]
*  It's where hospitals make their profit. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=784.88s)]
*  And so they're charging thousands of dollars for this MRI. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=786.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=790.96s)]
*  I didn't know I needed it. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=792.0s)]
*  I would have. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=793.36s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=794.4s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=795.36s)]
*  So it wasn't that you couldn't afford it. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=796.16s)]
*  You didn't know that you needed it. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=797.6s)]
*  And when something is... [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=799.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=800.56s)]
*  I didn't know that I needed it. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=801.52s)]
*  They found it. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=802.48s)]
*  And then I sprung, found a really good neurosurgeon. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=803.1999999999999s)]
*  Luckily, only needed one. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=805.8399999999999s)]
*  Have taken a dozen medications every day for the rest of my life and will. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=807.1999999999999s)]
*  But I've... [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=811.4399999999999s)]
*  Every once in a while, you sort of look at that... [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=813.6s)]
*  I put them all in the same bottle and I've got some shots and things. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=815.76s)]
*  But you look and you think, boy, I had to really fight to get these. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=818.8s)]
*  You have to fight for your life often and it just focuses you. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=822.24s)]
*  And we're here now. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=825.12s)]
*  What do we want to do with our lives? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=826.64s)]
*  And so there's maybe a positive outcome for that. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=828.32s)]
*  So, yeah, I try... [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=830.72s)]
*  You go from that recovery of a brain tumor. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=833.6800000000001s)]
*  Where did you launch first into your career? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=837.12s)]
*  Well, I'd already had some bit of a career. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=839.2s)]
*  But I went to finish my PhD and myself and two other students got [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=840.8s)]
*  $4 million from DARPA to commercialize our PhD technology. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=847.6800000000001s)]
*  So we started a company called Micro Display. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=852.0s)]
*  We were the first people to make micro displays for... [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=854.6400000000001s)]
*  We were trying to make a wristwatch video, VR, early smartphones, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=860.24s)]
*  a lot of projection stuff. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=864.32s)]
*  Had mass production, set up a manufacturing line in Richmond, California, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=866.6400000000001s)]
*  just north of Berkeley and shipped in a few years. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=870.8000000000001s)]
*  And we were shipping in all kinds of novel devices. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=874.6400000000001s)]
*  Basically something that looks exactly like Google Glass, but in 1998. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=878.16s)]
*  Looks the same. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=883.52s)]
*  The software improved, but the hardware was there then [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=885.36s)]
*  with a collaboration with an optical company called Micro Optical. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=888.96s)]
*  I need to be clear about that. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=891.84s)]
*  We made the screen part. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=893.12s)]
*  They made the optics. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=894.72s)]
*  So I did that for a while and got recruited at Intel to be the CTO of their division. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=896.5600000000001s)]
*  I like smaller companies better. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=904.64s)]
*  I don't like the sharp elbows as much. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=906.48s)]
*  I like everybody sort of in the same little rowboat helping each other to do the impossible [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=908.4s)]
*  rather than... [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=914.16s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=915.84s)]
*  Why do you need a... [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=916.64s)]
*  The goals in big companies seem to be having... [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=917.44s)]
*  How big is it? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=920.96s)]
*  Means how many people you have working on it. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=922.32s)]
*  Where the ideal for me is sort of like WhatsApps. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=924.24s)]
*  $19 billion, 50 people. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=926.88s)]
*  That seems like a much more interesting way to go. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=928.88s)]
*  A good exponential company. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=930.96s)]
*  Did you see the movie Oppenheimer? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=932.4s)]
*  If you did, did you know that besides building the atomic bomb at Los Alamos National Labs, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=934.48s)]
*  that they spent billions on bio-defense weapons, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=941.36s)]
*  the ability to accurately detect viruses and microbes by reading their RNA? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=944.96s)]
*  Well, a company called Viome exclusively licensed the technology from Los Alamos Labs [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=950.0s)]
*  to build a platform that can measure your microbiome and the RNA in your blood. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=955.28s)]
*  Viome has a product that I've personally used for years called Full Body Intelligence, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=961.0400000000001s)]
*  which collects a few drops of your blood, spit, and stool, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=965.52s)]
*  and can tell you so much about your health. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=968.64s)]
*  They've tested over 700,000 individuals and used their AI models to deliver members' [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=970.64s)]
*  critical health guidance, like what foods you should eat, what foods you shouldn't eat, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=975.6800000000001s)]
*  as well as your supplements and probiotics, your biological age, and other deep health insights. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=980.08s)]
*  And the results of the recommendations are nothing short of stellar. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=986.4000000000001s)]
*  As reported in the American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine, after just six months [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=989.92s)]
*  of following Viome's recommendations, members reported the following. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=994.4s)]
*  A 36% reduction in depression, a 40% reduction in anxiety, a 30% reduction in diabetes, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=998.16s)]
*  and a 48% reduction in IBS. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1006.0799999999999s)]
*  Listen, I've been using Viome for three years. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1008.88s)]
*  I know that my oral and gut health is one of my highest priorities. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1011.12s)]
*  Best of all, Viome is affordable, which is part of my mission to democratize health. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1016.16s)]
*  If you want to join me on this journey, go to viome.com slash Peter. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1021.28s)]
*  I've asked Naveen Jain, a friend of mine who's the founder and CEO of Viome, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1025.28s)]
*  to give my listeners a special discount. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1028.8799999999999s)]
*  You'll find it at viome.com slash Peter. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1031.12s)]
*  But you ended up in Intel, and that was an extraordinary sort of resurrection from surgery to Intel. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1034.96s)]
*  Yeah, and finishing the PhD even was a lot. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1043.36s)]
*  And then I left because Intel only has rail-to-rail processes. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1047.9199999999998s)]
*  And I ran into the CEO. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1052.8s)]
*  There's a new CEO just left. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1054.48s)]
*  And explain why we could never make as good silicon as anybody else because all our processes [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1058.08s)]
*  by rail-to-rail is either zero or a voltage. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1063.2s)]
*  But to get the best thing for a screen, because we want to see grayscale, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1066.56s)]
*  you need radiation and voltage. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1069.9199999999998s)]
*  I'm like, look, we could use anybody's silicon. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1072.08s)]
*  We're Intel. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1073.84s)]
*  Come into my office. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1075.1999999999998s)]
*  So anyway, I effectively pointed out in two sentences, literally in an elevator with a CEO, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1076.08s)]
*  the fundamental flaw. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1084.8799999999999s)]
*  And so anyway, I needed a job. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1086.8s)]
*  I was happy. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1088.8799999999999s)]
*  I saved them a few hundred million dollars a year of something that [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1090.3999999999999s)]
*  could not be Intel Silicon. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1094.9599999999998s)]
*  Everybody hated me. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1097.04s)]
*  Anyway, I put my resume on the line because I did have that PhD in physics. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1098.16s)]
*  And I'd already been a professor. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1104.72s)]
*  I had taken a break after my master's degree and was a computer science professor in Australia [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1106.3200000000002s)]
*  and then worked as an artist, a multimedia artist in Germany. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1111.52s)]
*  I want to get back to that later. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1114.24s)]
*  I want to hear about your art career, your music career. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1115.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I only got a callback at one place. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1118.3200000000002s)]
*  It was MIT, which is pretty good. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1121.3600000000001s)]
*  I applied to like 35 schools. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1123.3600000000001s)]
*  But I ended up with Nicolas Negroponte. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1125.84s)]
*  I had been a student at the MIT Media Lab in the 80s. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1128.96s)]
*  I did a master's degree there and made the world's first holographic video system [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1132.4s)]
*  with a team of graduate students and loved the place. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1136.24s)]
*  And in the final interview, it was supposed to be like 20 minutes with Nicolas Negroponte, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1139.84s)]
*  the legendary founder of the MIT Media Lab and many other things. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1145.12s)]
*  We started One Laptop per Child. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1149.92s)]
*  And so I started that in parallel and co-founded it with him and became the only other employee for the first year [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1152.48s)]
*  and basically lived on a plane with Nicolas while we... [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1160.16s)]
*  I made a prototype of the laptop, Kofi Annan, the then head of the UN. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1164.16s)]
*  And for those who don't know, One Laptop per Child really, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1167.44s)]
*  it was the objective of how do you get a thousand dollar laptop down to a hundred bucks? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1171.04s)]
*  And you launched the entire tablet industry as part of that. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1177.04s)]
*  Netbook and tablet came out through that, became a bigger thing. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1181.68s)]
*  I actually actually have one right over here. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1185.28s)]
*  If you want me to grab one, I can see it on the wall. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1187.28s)]
*  Yeah, the beautiful green One Laptop per... [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1189.6s)]
*  One Laptop design. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1192.16s)]
*  So this thing, and it wasn't just a stripped down laptop. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1194.0s)]
*  It was lowest power laptop ever made, lowest cost laptop ever made, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1197.2s)]
*  first mesh network laptop ever made. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1201.6s)]
*  We wrote the first keyboards in Amarik and a whole bunch of other languages. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1204.08s)]
*  No reading required to use it because it's for kids that don't know how to read. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1208.24s)]
*  How many of those were produced in total? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1212.24s)]
*  Millions. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1214.48s)]
*  I mean, we created a multi-billion dollar not for profit, open source. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1215.04s)]
*  And the lasting legacy is a few things. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1221.2s)]
*  We transformed what a minister of education could do for their children in the country. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1225.92s)]
*  Intel and Microsoft nearly killed us. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1229.76s)]
*  There was a 60 minute session. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1231.52s)]
*  They spent like exponentially more than we spent to stop it. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1233.52s)]
*  But eventually they... [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1240.8s)]
*  There's a lot of undue criticism on One Laptop per child, but what you did was extraordinary. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1242.56s)]
*  So we changed the equation of that. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1248.48s)]
*  Sundar Pichet, the CEO of Google, cites this. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1253.28s)]
*  Chromebook is its grandson, granddaughter, whatever, grandkid, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1257.6s)]
*  in terms of what we can do for education to make something quite usable for children. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1264.1599999999999s)]
*  So they cross the digital divide and also useful in pandemic. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1269.9199999999998s)]
*  When did you get addicted to moonshots? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1274.8s)]
*  Was that your first moonshot? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1279.04s)]
*  Probably holographic video. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1281.36s)]
*  I think like when the Nobel laureate stood up when I gave my first talk [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1283.12s)]
*  and said that's poppycock and it'll never work. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1286.88s)]
*  It was probably just two minutes of insult. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1291.0400000000002s)]
*  It felt like I was yelled at in front of everybody. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1293.1200000000001s)]
*  First talk, 20 something. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1295.6000000000001s)]
*  This is the equivalent of R2D2 projecting for Princess Leia. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1298.8000000000002s)]
*  I remember I had the courage after sort of going back to my hotel room and [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1302.72s)]
*  not being happy, probably crying. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1307.5200000000002s)]
*  I went up to him at the reception and I said, you know, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1311.2s)]
*  we all fit, you know, we all, you've done impossible things in your life. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1313.84s)]
*  And like, if there's an issue with this, like, could you explain like, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1318.0s)]
*  it's not sufficient to just say it's impossible. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1323.1999999999998s)]
*  Could you explain why it's impossible? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1325.28s)]
*  So let me, let me understand. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1327.1999999999998s)]
*  Let me set the setting here. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1327.9199999999998s)]
*  So you're giving a presentation on holographic video. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1328.8799999999999s)]
*  My first presentation on this research project I'm undertaking for my master's [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1332.48s)]
*  degree at MIT as a first year student. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1336.7199999999998s)]
*  And a Nobel laureate stands up and says, oh, I'm going to do this. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1339.04s)]
*  Stands up and says it's crazy. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1342.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1345.2s)]
*  It'll never work. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1345.44s)]
*  It's impossible. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1347.3600000000001s)]
*  And I remember talking to my advisor at the time, Steve Benton, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1349.1200000000001s)]
*  who ran the holography group at the Media Lab. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1352.88s)]
*  And he said, you know, when somebody tells you it's impossible, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1355.04s)]
*  what it means is they're a little bit jealous. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1359.04s)]
*  And I can't remember the other thing, but it was a little bit jealous. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1363.84s)]
*  And we keep going. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1367.3600000000001s)]
*  I think it means it's impossible for them. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1368.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1371.1200000000001s)]
*  They tried before, but you can look at it with the new eyes and find new ways through it. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1371.36s)]
*  And so, so yeah, so that's what we did. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1375.12s)]
*  So you actually went on, you went on to build that. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1377.9199999999998s)]
*  Yes, we did. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1380.9599999999998s)]
*  Built the world's first totally fully computer generated whole [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1382.1599999999999s)]
*  ground with a micron size pixels in 1987, which was hard to do then. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1385.28s)]
*  And computer generated on a supercomputer then, which looks a lot like Nvidia now, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1393.12s)]
*  but it was a connection machine, which was earlier, early. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1398.56s)]
*  So that's your first moonshot. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1402.08s)]
*  Would you consider one laptop your second? [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1405.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think we really did transform things. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1408.6399999999999s)]
*  People don't remember it now, but the kids do. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1413.28s)]
*  And they're still working in the field by the way. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1417.04s)]
*  These laptops have been working for 20 years because they're so low power too. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1418.8s)]
*  And durable. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1423.04s)]
*  It's incredible architecture. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1423.6s)]
*  I decided around the screen. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1425.12s)]
*  Nobody does that. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1426.48s)]
*  Who cares if the CPU is on the CPU people, like Intel, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1428.0s)]
*  they think they're the brains behind the operation. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1431.44s)]
*  And like, there could be little green men inside the laptop. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1433.28s)]
*  The screen's on. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1437.36s)]
*  If it responds to a stroke, you can shut the whole mother down, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1438.48s)]
*  but down a vast majority of the time, then bring it back up [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1442.16s)]
*  in a single digit number of milliseconds. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1447.2s)]
*  And it seems like it's on. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1450.48s)]
*  And so that's really important because kids in the developing world at that time, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1452.32s)]
*  half of them lacked steady ready access to power. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1457.28s)]
*  Also had a screen. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1461.44s)]
*  I'm a screen designer. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1463.68s)]
*  That was the better resolution than the Apple Retinal Display. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1465.76s)]
*  Same time. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1470.32s)]
*  A hundred bucks. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1471.2s)]
*  And this is a laptop. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1471.84s)]
*  And the computers at the time cost two, the laptops cost $2,000. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1473.04s)]
*  And you had to buy $2,000 a software for them. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1476.72s)]
*  People forget. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1479.12s)]
*  So it was a massive change in cost structure. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1480.24s)]
*  What kind of battery life did it have? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1482.6399999999999s)]
*  Oh, extraordinary battery life. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1485.12s)]
*  And the life of the batteries. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1487.04s)]
*  We were the first ones. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1489.04s)]
*  I went to BYD. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1490.48s)]
*  Wow, back then. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1493.12s)]
*  And made lithium ferro phosphate battery because the lithium ion batteries were burning. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1493.92s)]
*  And lithium ferro phosphate burns at 100 degrees C. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1499.68s)]
*  And we conditioned it so that it could last through 2,000 charge recharge cycles, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1502.8s)]
*  which was like 10, 20 times what normal lithium ion batteries could do at the time. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1508.8799999999999s)]
*  So here's out of this right now. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1514.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so there was a lot of innovation. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1516.88s)]
*  We're talking dozens of hours of battery life. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1518.8000000000002s)]
*  Oh, yeah, it would last for a day or two. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1522.64s)]
*  But you could hand crank it because it's so low power or a small solar cell would recharge it. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1525.6000000000001s)]
*  And we gave those out too. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1531.2s)]
*  What a beautiful design. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1533.6000000000001s)]
*  So thank you for that work. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1536.8000000000002s)]
*  So after one laptop, where do you go next? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1538.4s)]
*  I start a company called Pixel Qi because I thought I sort of gave up my job thinking [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1541.3600000000001s)]
*  that the laptop's built. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1546.56s)]
*  Why don't we get somebody that knows about education coming in? [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1548.96s)]
*  Here's where being a woman in tech, they think I know about education. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1551.28s)]
*  Like, well, I know children. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1555.6s)]
*  I was. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1558.16s)]
*  I think they go to school. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1558.72s)]
*  But it's time to bring in education experts. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1560.0s)]
*  And so I decided to help the industry design more interesting stuff. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1562.56s)]
*  So I left MIT because I was more excited about what I could use with the multi-billion dollar [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1566.64s)]
*  fabs of Asia, despite the best postdoc I could get, maybe make one thing once, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1571.36s)]
*  but then not be able to repeat it for a year because the contamination or whatever happened [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1576.72s)]
*  in the beautiful MIT labs. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1580.8s)]
*  I moved to Asia, started a company called Pixel Qi and made really innovative screen [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1583.28s)]
*  technology as the first fabless screen maker. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1588.72s)]
*  I made a lot of screens for tablets and laptops and smartphones, but then other unique screens [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1592.16s)]
*  until Sergey at Google fell in love with it. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1598.32s)]
*  And also I was trying to work on Brain Computer Interface and they were starting Google Labs. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1602.8s)]
*  We'll come back to BCI for those listening. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1606.72s)]
*  Anyway, so Google Apple hired the whole company in Bits and Star. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1608.72s)]
*  So you end up with Sergey at Google in their moonshot factory. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1613.9199999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1619.12s)]
*  Because Sergey wanted a lot of stuff. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1620.6399999999999s)]
*  But I'm working on innovative consumer electronics, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1622.16s)]
*  leveraging Android and many other abilities of Google. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1625.8400000000001s)]
*  So I'm doing things that Larry and Sergey want me to do. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1630.3200000000002s)]
*  You can read about what I'm not supposed to ever say what I did there. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1635.76s)]
*  You can read about it. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1640.0800000000002s)]
*  I know what you did there. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1640.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1642.0s)]
*  So there are some very cool projects and then- [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1643.1200000000001s)]
*  Large holographic walls included. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1649.0400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1652.8000000000002s)]
*  And screens on every surface. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1653.76s)]
*  How do you do that? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1656.24s)]
*  And then why would you do that? [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1657.1200000000001s)]
*  They weren't holographic though. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1661.92s)]
*  They were flat. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1663.1200000000001s)]
*  Something I've been doing in pandemic is I think everybody wants a million dollar view. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1664.0s)]
*  So all you have to do is make the screen an optical infinity. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1668.88s)]
*  Meaning, and then anybody could feel like they were some place else when they got home. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1673.44s)]
*  A lot of people spent time- [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1678.64s)]
*  I was just at a friend. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1680.96s)]
*  I was just at Mark Pinkus's home and he has a beautiful home overlooking the San Francisco [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1683.04s)]
*  Bay and the Golden Gate Bridge there. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1689.04s)]
*  And it was floor to ceiling, 30 foot, 40 foot wide windows and it was breathtaking view. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1691.2s)]
*  And I was like, I would love that on a screen. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1699.12s)]
*  Why can't anybody- and the 3D is very important. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1702.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1706.0s)]
*  Screens are now about $10 a square foot. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1707.06s)]
*  Windows are more expensive. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1709.38s)]
*  It's amazing what's happened. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1711.54s)]
*  Morphosilicon is also the substrate for solar panels. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1713.78s)]
*  It's just mass abundance. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1717.86s)]
*  So if you've got that, how do you use that and our tools, the software they look- [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1720.74s)]
*  But we have all of these photos of everything and yeah, you can have updates. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1726.58s)]
*  Do you think you could create a large scale video wall that looks identical to a view [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1730.9s)]
*  out the window? [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1740.9s)]
*  Well, yes. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1741.94s)]
*  And that's like a side project. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1745.38s)]
*  I call it my Venice Biennale project. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1747.38s)]
*  I don't know if I'll get into Venice Biennale. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1750.02s)]
*  Can I join you on that one? [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1750.9s)]
*  I love that idea. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1751.94s)]
*  Yeah, I'd love to do it as an art project and then just get it into someone else to the startup. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1753.0600000000002s)]
*  Or maybe you can think of somebody but you know, it's a lot of work. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1761.38s)]
*  I've got someone in mind. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1763.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1764.42s)]
*  No, I mean- [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1765.0600000000002s)]
*  It's a side project. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1765.7s)]
*  I have a little studio. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1766.8200000000002s)]
*  I work on that sometimes on the weekends just to clear my head. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1767.8600000000001s)]
*  And you can flip the switch and you can be on the surface of the moon or Mars. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1770.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1774.8200000000002s)]
*  Wherever. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1775.22s)]
*  Looking over the Eiffel Tower. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1775.7800000000002s)]
*  It's much easier if you're at optical infinity. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1777.5400000000002s)]
*  Meaning if you close one eye and the other eye, you see a disparity, a difference between [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1781.0600000000002s)]
*  the views. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1786.74s)]
*  But if something's far enough away, it's easier to compute. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1787.3s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1794.1s)]
*  Everybody's winking their eyes right now left and right. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1795.46s)]
*  It's easier. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1798.1s)]
*  So anyway, there's all these steps but I've walked away from screen technology. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1798.98s)]
*  I just miss it sometimes, particularly in the isolation of pandemic. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1802.34s)]
*  So you're with Sergey. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1805.3799999999999s)]
*  You're in the moonshot factory there, which was an exciting time. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1807.86s)]
*  I mean, you know, with Astro. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1810.82s)]
*  Were you there when Astro was there or just before? [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1812.74s)]
*  I did overlap a bit with Astro. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1815.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1817.78s)]
*  And then on to Oculus from there. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1818.74s)]
*  Yeah, Mark recruited me. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1821.06s)]
*  He had bought this company for a bunch of money. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1822.5s)]
*  They'd never shipped anything, particularly distinguished by the screens and the optics. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1825.1399999999999s)]
*  It kind of bought me like I was a company. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1830.1799999999998s)]
*  I didn't actually want to go. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1832.58s)]
*  Some things happened at Google that pissed me off that, sorry, I shouldn't go into detail [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1833.86s)]
*  because never speak ill. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1838.1799999999998s)]
*  But you know, it really was lucrative. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1839.7s)]
*  My most successful project up till then had been the not-for-profit. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1842.1s)]
*  So it was quite lucrative to go. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1845.8600000000001s)]
*  I probably shouldn't have gone. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1849.54s)]
*  I liked Google better. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1850.9s)]
*  I love Google as a culture. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1853.54s)]
*  And I mean, they've done so much. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1855.3s)]
*  People don't know how much Google has done for the world in so many ways. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1858.42s)]
*  The investments, the projects they've done. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1861.78s)]
*  Yeah, I liked and I loved working for Sergey. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1863.8600000000001s)]
*  He was fantastic to work for. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1866.42s)]
*  And hi, Sergey. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1868.3400000000001s)]
*  Oh, we can kill it. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1870.1000000000001s)]
*  Anyway, so you go and you join the team at Oculus. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1871.38s)]
*  You're reporting directly to Mark. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1875.5400000000002s)]
*  Were you in Facebook? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1876.98s)]
*  It moved around. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1878.98s)]
*  They called me game changer. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1880.74s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1883.0600000000002s)]
*  I had another title too, but I was supposed to sort of figure out how to change the game [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1883.38s)]
*  from what we were doing. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1887.7s)]
*  But I knew that it was a rocky road. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1890.1000000000001s)]
*  I mean, they'd just gotten bought. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1892.5800000000002s)]
*  They were trying to, you know, whatever. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1895.14s)]
*  So I did what I could. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1896.98s)]
*  And invented some very cool sunglass VR AR systems and a bunch of things that hopefully [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1899.14s)]
*  will see the light of day. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1904.5800000000002s)]
*  So let me take it aside there one moment because you are the screen goddess and the [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1905.7800000000002s)]
*  miniaturization goddess. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1911.7s)]
*  How far do you think we are from wearable AR VR specs like you're wearing right now [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1914.74s)]
*  that are light and enjoyable? [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1922.26s)]
*  It's a matter of will. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1926.74s)]
*  I mean, they've spent a hundred billion dollars. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1927.78s)]
*  I know it's a lot of money. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1930.34s)]
*  And it's surprising how little of whatever they have in the labs if they've pursued that [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1932.18s)]
*  has seen the light of day. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1939.7s)]
*  It's not that efficient. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1941.1399999999999s)]
*  I mean, I think, you know, Reid Hoffman wrote a book about it, Blitzscaling. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1942.34s)]
*  Like when you spend a ton of money, it's not that efficient. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1946.58s)]
*  It's not maybe supposed to be. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1949.78s)]
*  It makes their taxes come out right. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1951.06s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1952.42s)]
*  But it's a lot of money. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1953.22s)]
*  Mark really deeply believes in it. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1954.42s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1956.74s)]
*  I didn't like the face bug. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1959.06s)]
*  I don't... [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1961.06s)]
*  You're like covering your face with a giant mask. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1962.98s)]
*  I want the million dollar view. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1966.82s)]
*  I don't want to have to wear it. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1968.42s)]
*  I don't want... [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1969.7s)]
*  But different... [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1971.3s)]
*  You know, all of this is true of any technology. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1972.02s)]
*  I've got a bunch of different opinions and they mix and match. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1975.06s)]
*  And this has been going on since the late 60s with VR and AR and different... [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1977.3s)]
*  Since the human interface labs up at Seattle. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1982.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1985.06s)]
*  They were... [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1985.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1986.4199999999998s)]
*  But, you know, Scott... [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1986.82s)]
*  Boy, I can't think of his name. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1988.98s)]
*  I'm thinking of a guy at MIT as well. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1990.1s)]
*  But, you know, and Jaren Lanier and, you know, the different waves of it and move forward. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1992.34s)]
*  And what we did in holography too. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1997.46s)]
*  So I want to set the picture here. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=1999.54s)]
*  You have been at the top of the entire tech stack, the industry, at Intel, at Google, at Facebook. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2002.5s)]
*  And you witnessed digitization, dematerialization, demonetization, democratization. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2012.18s)]
*  You've seen the power of these technologies. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2020.66s)]
*  What was the moment that you decided, I need to focus on reinventing healthcare because it's so broken? [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2024.82s)]
*  When I left Intel in 2004 and pitched at the Media Lab and got the faculty position. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2031.94s)]
*  But I got distracted with a $100 laptop and thought, well, I can get that to work faster. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2038.42s)]
*  Even though everybody thinks it's impossible, I thought it was much faster. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2043.6200000000001s)]
*  Then, you know, I got hooked into that. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2048.02s)]
*  And when I went into Google, I was supposed to work on this. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2051.38s)]
*  But then when I got in, Sergey said, no, we just wanted to know you were creative. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2053.86s)]
*  Like, I had all these ideas for brain computer interface and healthcare. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2060.82s)]
*  And when I got in, he really needed me to do other things. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2065.14s)]
*  I was actually pretty happy to be working there on the things that I was doing. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2068.1s)]
*  So that took a backseat. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2071.7799999999997s)]
*  When I went over to Facebook and interviewed with Mark, I swear his feet didn't touch the ground [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2073.46s)]
*  when I started talking to him about brain computer interface. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2079.62s)]
*  We had the whiteboard in the room and what we could do for healthcare. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2082.8199999999997s)]
*  And I'm like, this is it. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2087.06s)]
*  He gets it. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2087.94s)]
*  And then I come and he's like, well, you know, he got to fix his near thing first. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2088.42s)]
*  And I spend a lot of money. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2091.46s)]
*  I spend billions of dollars on this. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2093.46s)]
*  I know. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2095.62s)]
*  But this is before. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2096.2599999999998s)]
*  This is like whatever. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2097.14s)]
*  This is 2015, like nine years ago. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2098.18s)]
*  I think I started. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2100.9s)]
*  So a year later, 2016, I left. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2101.46s)]
*  You left. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2105.46s)]
*  What was that? [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2107.94s)]
*  What happened? [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2108.9s)]
*  You said it's time for me to go and build my dream company. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2109.7s)]
*  Well, it's the fourth company and I've been in startups now for, you know, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2115.2999999999997s)]
*  half of my life. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2120.58s)]
*  So I'm good at the startups. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2121.7s)]
*  I think. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2123.54s)]
*  When you have so many people with so many different opinions, I mean, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2127.46s)]
*  one thing I did for Facebook and for Google, since the core competency [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2130.58s)]
*  of the executive management was really optimizing click through revenue for ad sales, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2136.02s)]
*  because let's face it, it's hard to say that. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2141.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's true. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2144.2599999999998s)]
*  Whatever Gmail or getting socially a lot of things like that. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2146.18s)]
*  But it wasn't on these new technologies. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2150.74s)]
*  So one of the things I tried to bring in is a wide variety of expertise [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2154.02s)]
*  that we could share what we're doing and just take feedback. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2158.2599999999998s)]
*  It's just frustrating because educating the software giants in this other thing, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2162.58s)]
*  it was actually faster and easier just to start your own and build the thing [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2169.8599999999997s)]
*  without all the politics. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2174.18s)]
*  I'm not, you know, it's just it's look moonshots, you know, you can call NASA a moonshot, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2176.42s)]
*  but it was like part of the Cold War. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2183.06s)]
*  The Wright brothers was a moonshot. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2184.74s)]
*  Yes. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2186.98s)]
*  The invention of the birth control panel was a moonshot. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2187.62s)]
*  There are small teams that did it, you know, somehow. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2190.3399999999997s)]
*  And I think it's just easier, honestly, to do it that way. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2193.14s)]
*  Everybody want to take a short break from our episode to talk about a company [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2197.06s)]
*  that's very important to me and could actually save your life [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2200.02s)]
*  or the life of someone that you love. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2204.34s)]
*  Company is called Fountain Life. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2205.94s)]
*  And it's a company I started years ago with Tony Robbins [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2207.94s)]
*  and a group of very talented physicians. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2211.1400000000003s)]
*  You know, most of us don't actually know what's going on inside our body. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2213.6200000000003s)]
*  We're all optimists until that day when you have a pain in your side, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2218.02s)]
*  you go to the physician in the emergency room and they say, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2222.42s)]
*  listen, I'm sorry to tell you this, but you have this stage three or four going on. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2224.7400000000002s)]
*  And, you know, it didn't start that morning. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2229.46s)]
*  It probably was a problem that's been going on for some time. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2232.34s)]
*  But because we never look, we don't find out. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2235.78s)]
*  So what we built at Fountain Life was the world's most advanced diagnostic centers. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2239.38s)]
*  We have four across the US today and we're building 20 around the world. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2244.9s)]
*  These centers give you a full body MRI, a brain, a brain vasculature, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2249.54s)]
*  an AI enabled coronary CT looking for soft plaque, a DEXA scan, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2254.42s)]
*  a grail blood cancer test, a full executive blood workup. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2258.9s)]

*  All right, let's go back to our episode. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2335.78s)]
*  All right, so it's 2016 and you found Open Water, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2337.6200000000003s)]
*  which is the extraordinary company we're about to dive into. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2341.86s)]
*  Where does the name Open Water come from? [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2347.3s)]
*  Peter Gabriel. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2350.82s)]
*  Tell me about that. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2352.82s)]
*  Peter's amazing. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2354.02s)]
*  Peter Gabriel, the rock star, human rights activist, extraordinaire, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2355.38s)]
*  started calling me. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2361.54s)]
*  I knew him from my art school multimedia days in the 80s, 90s. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2362.6600000000003s)]
*  And I ran into him at a conference and told him when I was doing it, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2367.78s)]
*  he started calling me every day saying, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2370.74s)]
*  you've got to leave Facebook. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2372.9799999999996s)]
*  You have to do this outside. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2374.2599999999998s)]
*  And he started writing, he wrote this essay about Open Water, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2375.4599999999996s)]
*  about our thoughts flowing like water and having to take swimming lessons [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2380.18s)]
*  to learn how to deal with it because it would really change [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2384.9799999999996s)]
*  how we interact with each other if we are sort of transparent [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2388.02s)]
*  in all of our human weaknesses and seven virtues and seven, you know, whatever. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2392.2599999999998s)]
*  All the issues that one has if it was transparent. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2399.14s)]
*  So he really strongly encouraged me and kept calling. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2403.22s)]
*  And we had all these great conversations. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2407.3799999999997s)]
*  So I said, okay, great, let's do it. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2409.2999999999997s)]
*  Can I use the name? [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2411.3799999999997s)]
*  And he let me use the name. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2412.2599999999998s)]
*  So he's got sweat equity. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2413.3799999999997s)]
*  He's also an investor. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2415.62s)]
*  And I have to say a full disclosure to everybody listening and watching. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2418.1s)]
*  I am an investor through my venture fund. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2422.3399999999997s)]
*  I'm a proud advisor of Open Water. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2425.14s)]
*  So I'm totally, completely biased. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2427.54s)]
*  And I'm sharing this with you because of the extraordinary work that [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2430.18s)]
*  Mary Lou, as you shall soon see and have seen, is doing. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2433.38s)]
*  So I want to make sure that disclosure is out there in the open. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2437.06s)]
*  So I love that. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2440.42s)]
*  And Peter Gabriel's probably greatest contribution to society [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2441.38s)]
*  will be the fact that he pushed you to get the company going. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2445.22s)]
*  I stunned so much. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2447.62s)]
*  All right. One of us. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2449.7799999999997s)]
*  He continues to. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2450.58s)]
*  So what was the vision here? [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2453.22s)]
*  Let's now dive in because the tech you have built and you are now rolling out [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2456.1s)]
*  is going to save millions of lives. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2462.02s)]
*  Just to put a number on this, I don't think people realize that near 25% [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2464.5s)]
*  of the U.S. economy is going towards health care expenses. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2469.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2474.9s)]
*  And saying. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2476.5s)]
*  30% for hospitals, another 20% for doctors. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2477.0s)]
*  That's half of it. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2480.18s)]
*  6% for R&D. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2481.38s)]
*  Insurance is only like 8% or 9%. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2483.2999999999997s)]
*  But it's huge. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2485.06s)]
*  And it doesn't move forward. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2487.2999999999997s)]
*  Like as you say, so articulate, sick care, you know, it's not moving the needle fast enough. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2489.2999999999997s)]
*  We need to do something better if we care about people's lives. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2496.2599999999998s)]
*  I don't think we're counting the 55 million people that die every year globally. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2499.22s)]
*  Can you describe the state of the medical industry today? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2503.22s)]
*  I just want to have. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2507.86s)]
*  I want to set the comparative objective that you're about to crush. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2508.9s)]
*  Kill, destroy. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2514.8199999999997s)]
*  It's the cycle time. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2517.3799999999997s)]
*  I mean, there's some good cures, but you know, you got one of those diagnosed, you know, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2518.8199999999997s)]
*  what, you know, 30% of us are taking out with cardiovascular disease, another 25% with cancer [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2524.5s)]
*  day in, day out, you know, neurodegenerative disease takes you out if you late last long enough. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2531.06s)]
*  There's the pathogens. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2536.5s)]
*  There's the other chronic diseases like diabetes and so forth. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2537.94s)]
*  And the treatments don't change that fast. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2542.34s)]
*  It's now 26 years and close to $3 billion for a new drug approval, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2544.66s)]
*  capitalized cost. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2552.18s)]
*  The shocking thing for medical device, a novel medical device, [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2553.62s)]
*  it's close to $700 million and 13 years capitalized costs. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2558.18s)]
*  To get to go from an idea to developing it and getting it approved by the FDA. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2562.5s)]
*  Just for approval, let alone reimbursement and becoming standard of care, which takes [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2567.54s)]
*  out to about $1.5 billion. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2572.7400000000002s)]
*  So say you do that for a single rare disease because it's faster, [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2575.3s)]
*  costs less because you don't need as many patients. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2578.98s)]
*  You spent a billion. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2581.54s)]
*  Let's say you save some money. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2582.5s)]
*  It costs $700 million. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2583.7s)]
*  A few thousand people have it. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2586.42s)]
*  What do you charge per patient? [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2587.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2589.78s)]
*  That's zeroes in it, doesn't it? [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2590.9s)]
*  A few thousand people divided by the $700 million or $700 million by the $2,000 people. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2591.94s)]
*  Things like it's an understatement to say the vast majority of humanity can't afford that cost. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2596.9s)]
*  So what are we doing? [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2603.22s)]
*  Why are we funding this? [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2605.38s)]
*  The biggest funders of healthcare R&D, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2606.74s)]
*  nine out of every 10 healthcare dollars in the US comes from NGOs and GEOs. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2610.66s)]
*  And they're funding things that's like, you know, [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2615.94s)]
*  maybe trickle down economics works eventually. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2618.1s)]
*  The saddest thing, and I know you've said this, [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2621.2999999999997s)]
*  is what percentage of drugs that are prescribed for you actually work? [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2624.02s)]
*  Oh, oh, yeah. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2631.14s)]
*  The number's quite low. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2634.02s)]
*  I don't have it. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2636.34s)]
*  It's like 20%. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2636.98s)]
*  For me personally, they work. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2638.1s)]
*  I checked that because I don't know. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2639.62s)]
*  But you assume that when the doctor- [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2642.02s)]
*  Literally in that case, I'm missing part of my brain. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2643.94s)]
*  It's a pituitary gland. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2646.42s)]
*  I molecularly replace it, age and sex appropriate doses. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2647.78s)]
*  But for most people, yeah, do they work or not? [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2652.26s)]
*  And do they cause harm? [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2654.6600000000003s)]
*  It's a thing. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2655.86s)]
*  For sure. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2657.7000000000003s)]
*  And, you know, like, it's 50, 40 to $70,000 per patient in a clinical trial. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2658.34s)]
*  And it takes years to get them through. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2665.2200000000003s)]
*  For a bigger disease like mental disease or neurodegenerative disease, [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2667.38s)]
*  you got to do 10,000, 100,000 patients. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2670.34s)]
*  So the cost becomes, and the time becomes prohibitive. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2672.5800000000004s)]
*  So we have to somehow change this if we want [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2678.1800000000003s)]
*  more innovation and to leverage the tools of our time. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2682.7400000000002s)]
*  Yes, AI, but also Moore's Law are two of those big exponentials. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2685.6200000000003s)]
*  So there's others as well, which you can list for us because- [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2690.42s)]
*  I list them all the time. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2694.0200000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2695.86s)]
*  But clinical trials are- they're exponentially slower and exponentially more expensive over time [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2696.5800000000004s)]
*  as it's been well-graphed and they call it Moore's Law backwards, Eroom's Law. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2705.86s)]
*  So that's the big problem that I think you have to change, which enables you [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2710.34s)]
*  to enable low cost but also get more data. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2718.82s)]
*  If you can get more data than we've ever had before, [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2724.1800000000003s)]
*  it's less risky for a regulator to approve a new treatment or medical device or so forth. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2727.6200000000003s)]
*  But it's also safer for a doctor and patient to make a decision for their health care. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2737.7s)]
*  So why not just collect more data? [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2741.7799999999997s)]
*  We're really good at crunching data. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2743.06s)]
*  We're going to learn even more through crunching the data or the AI tools than we have. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2744.3399999999997s)]
*  But for that, it's very hard if you're making a new drug that's never physically existed before [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2748.98s)]
*  and putting it in somebody's body to get that kind of scale quickly [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2755.22s)]
*  because you got to go through some tests first. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2758.74s)]
*  We're going to use- so what Mary Lou is talking about is using physics and AI and chipsets to [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2761.22s)]
*  just not only diagnose but treat disease. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2769.7s)]
*  It is 60s. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2774.4199999999996s)]
*  It is dramatically dropping costs by not 10x. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2775.62s)]
*  We're talking about potentially hundreds and thousands of x reduction in cost [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2782.58s)]
*  and putting this technology in potentially every village throughout Africa. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2788.1s)]
*  I've been with billionaires all through my- it's interesting on Thanksgiving in the US, [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2794.98s)]
*  you end up getting calls, the family gets together, they find my name, [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2798.9s)]
*  somebody's got a disease. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2803.22s)]
*  So that's where I spent my Thanksgiving weekend. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2804.42s)]
*  It's everybody. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2806.5s)]
*  Despite economic level and borders and it's like consumer electronics. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2808.66s)]
*  So Mary Lou, let's jump into some of the graphics you have here. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2815.46s)]
*  I want people to internalize and understand the incredible tech you have built and what [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2819.62s)]
*  the implications are because people need to see this to understand it and believe it because [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2826.9s)]
*  it's as impactful as the mobile phone has been. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2833.94s)]
*  So yeah, we started in labs like these and worked to develop different designs, [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2838.1s)]
*  modulating the phase of light and sound and then came to build out these carts in about [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2842.9s)]
*  the year 2020 and get them in the hospitals and we got really great results in sensitivity [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2851.14s)]
*  and specificity. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2857.86s)]
*  Slow it down here one second because what you've been doing is [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2861.7000000000003s)]
*  utilizing and miniaturizing ultrasound and lasers and cameras to be able to impact things. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2866.9s)]
*  Yeah, so I'll show more a little bit later. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2876.34s)]
*  Like we've got great results and I can go about that but so we've now shrunk these down. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2879.54s)]
*  How big were these things before? [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2885.06s)]
*  Because they're the size now of something like a headband, right? [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2887.3s)]
*  They were the size of a room. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2890.1s)]
*  The size of a room. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2892.34s)]
*  That's what we were talking about. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2893.3s)]
*  That's what we started with in 2016 with the size of the room and manipulating the phase of light [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2895.38s)]
*  and sound so we could steer it wherever we wanted to in the body. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2902.02s)]
*  We could interfere it to create wave structures and we could resonate it to selectively affect [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2905.7000000000003s)]
*  different cells with different structures like an opera can affect that wine glass. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2914.1s)]
*  So that was the premise to start the company using what I know about analog chip design. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2919.7799999999997s)]
*  Not the digital stuff that Intel does but like using various voltages and frequencies and [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2926.5s)]
*  So this desktop image you have here is basically the breadboard, [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2934.42s)]
*  the proof of concept that the physics works. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2938.66s)]
*  Yeah, these are big optical tables that float on nitrogen gas and allow you to do experiments [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2941.2999999999997s)]
*  where you can see the phase of light. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2947.38s)]
*  If you have to say how much it got miniaturized in scale and price between 2016 and today, [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2950.98s)]
*  give me some orders of magnitude. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2958.5s)]
*  These are multi-million dollar systems. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2960.1800000000003s)]
*  We went down to the carts which were 100 to 500 thousand dollars and then we went down [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2962.7400000000002s)]
*  to this side so I have it with me like here is the council. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2967.86s)]
*  Yes. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2972.1s)]
*  That was the cart. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2972.26s)]
*  That starts production next to this one. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2974.02s)]
*  Here's the headset for it that comes in different sizes. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2978.34s)]
*  We have a six pack of ultrasound for the abs, 3D print, whatever you want, [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2984.02s)]
*  strap it to any part of your body. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2988.58s)]
*  We envision this going on the back of your knee to do both pathogen deactivation and also [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2990.9s)]
*  senescent cell rejuvenation as well as amyloid micro clot removal. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=2998.26s)]
*  We have some very good results in research for that right now. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3005.14s)]
*  There's that and I've shown you the box for our imaging system is this is the console for it. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3008.74s)]
*  It looks like 100x or 1000x reduction in volume. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3020.02s)]
*  We're selling these for 10k but at volume this goes to the cost of a smartphone. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3025.22s)]
*  What would that... [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3031.62s)]
*  Give me a number here. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3032.74s)]
*  1000x reduction in price. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3034.82s)]
*  Oh sorry the actual device... [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3036.58s)]
*  No but from where it was in 2016. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3039.62s)]
*  But you can treat something for the cost of a phone call then. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3042.1s)]
*  Which becomes really interesting as you think of cost structures and there's no shortages [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3046.58s)]
*  which are really a huge problem also right now in medical. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3052.98s)]
*  So yeah it's a device with pan disease impact. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3058.58s)]
*  Well let's dive into the major ones here because let's start with... [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3062.02s)]
*  I can show you some of that. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3065.94s)]
*  This is the waves and we steer the waves. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3069.62s)]
*  So here's like cancer cells in glioblastoma. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3071.54s)]
*  We did have some great results with glioblastoma and the problem is the surgeon can't get the [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3074.58s)]
*  whole tumor out. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3079.46s)]
*  Some cancer cells hide out amid the neurons. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3081.94s)]
*  You can't scoop out all the neurons. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3084.34s)]
*  But just so people to know glioblastoma is right now a death sentence. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3086.98s)]
*  100% of people do not survive it. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3092.42s)]
*  I had a friend recently who passed and if you've ever heard of someone having a deadly [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3095.38s)]
*  brain cancer it's the last diagnosis you want to hear and there's very little you can do. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3102.74s)]
*  And from the time of diagnosis typically it's months maybe a year that you have left. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3110.1s)]
*  Yeah it's not long but all cancer all aggressive cancer cells share a mechanical property [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3117.22s)]
*  that normal cells don't have which is the definition of metastasis. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3123.46s)]
*  They've got a big nucleus a small cytoplasm. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3128.18s)]
*  The big nucleus... [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3130.3399999999997s)]
*  Because they're growing so fast. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3130.74s)]
*  They divide the DNA is in there fast because they want to grow and kill you. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3132.2599999999998s)]
*  So we exploit that like an opera singer can ping this wine glass match the frequency [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3136.9s)]
*  and destroy that wine glass and harm nothing else in the room. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3143.2200000000003s)]
*  So we did that first with 16 different types of glioblastoma and grew them up in organoids [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3147.1400000000003s)]
*  and went through sound sweeps over many octaves and many rhythms to find the ones that killed [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3154.26s)]
*  the glioblastoma cells and didn't harm the healthy tissue. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3160.42s)]
*  So you found their resonance frequency. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3163.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah and then we did that in mice. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3166.74s)]
*  So here are the mice this is the size of the tumor without treatment. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3169.2999999999997s)]
*  Here are our top three treatments we gave one two-minute dose at a diagnostic level that means [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3173.7799999999997s)]
*  lower than used on pregnant women and their fetuses in the western world on billions of [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3179.38s)]
*  them for the last 50 years. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3185.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3187.2999999999997s)]
*  Diagnostic level destroyed the tumor needed another dose at day five [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3187.54s)]
*  two-minute dose 10 duty cycle 150 kilohertz. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3193.14s)]
*  That's the frequency of a fish finder. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3197.8599999999997s)]
*  This is the best one we tried a bunch of them but then we had some trouble getting into humans [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3202.42s)]
*  because safety and whatever safety literally people know the death sentence. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3207.3799999999997s)]
*  That kills me. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3212.42s)]
*  I hate that part. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3213.06s)]
*  10 billion people right okay so we switch it up to 400 kilohertz overfiring neurons like a lot [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3214.66s)]
*  of things cause severe depression. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3222.34s)]
*  These people we did a study of 20 people at University of Arizona was severe depression [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3223.7000000000003s)]
*  really severe depression and we took fmri's of them we saw the overfiring neurons here in the [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3228.98s)]
*  front you can see the overfiring neurons fmri shows the use of oxygen and that correlates to [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3234.1800000000003s)]
*  overfiring neurons and we quelled them and nearly half of our patients just for study [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3240.58s)]
*  not even tuning the dosage is right went into remission. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3249.3s)]
*  Of severe depression. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3253.2200000000003s)]
*  Severe depression. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3254.82s)]
*  What's the best drug do for us today? [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3255.54s)]
*  Much less much. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3258.98s)]
*  That's crazy how long did this treatment take? [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3260.5800000000004s)]
*  We did it for five minutes a day every day for the first week five days and then the second week [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3263.6200000000003s)]
*  three days and the third week three days and five minutes are still in remission so you could have [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3271.6200000000003s)]
*  this device at home and do it that way we also I showed on stage how we make sure that we align [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3277.7s)]
*  it because what we're doing is focusing sound to that exact place and so I'll show you how we align [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3285.22s)]
*  it a little bit later we take a cell phone take a lot of pictures of your face and then register [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3292.8999999999996s)]
*  make that into a mesh and register the bone structure onto the MRI but we do that while [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3296.98s)]
*  you're wearing this so we know exactly where the transducers are so we can focus at exactly [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3302.4199999999996s)]
*  the right spot this can also be useful for addiction I was gonna say I heard you say that [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3307.2999999999997s)]
*  I mean so someone who has an addictive personality addicted to drugs addicted to gambling addictions [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3312.1s)]
*  all addictions we can see the overfiring I want a glass of wine in the evening [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3317.7s)]
*  I'm working on it it's not that bad but still you know like whatever it is that your your addiction [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3324.58s)]
*  is like how do you how do you how do you down regulate how do you down regulate it but also [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3330.8999999999996s)]
*  I mean this basically leapfrogs transcranial magnetic stimulation which is also approved for [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3336.74s)]
*  neurodegenerative diseases and other things so we're and then we're also now I mentioned [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3341.62s)]
*  have some early preclinical work showing amyloid microclots and sort of ability to [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3347.14s)]
*  so it just goes on it's a multi-purpose machine but yeah it can take it can do this also we think [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3357.54s)]
*  neurodegenerative disease treatments as well as other mental diseases so the results are pretty [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3364.58s)]
*  spectacular and you developed this early on for strokes as well okay detection so let's not [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3370.5s)]
*  let's not forget about about your first application right so the stroke detection that's this unit [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3378.02s)]
*  that's um the optical laser with the high quantum efficiency camera chips that are shipping in [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3382.5s)]
*  smartphones that cost a buck apiece and with that we took um these can we can we set this up a little [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3389.46s)]
*  bit so the second leading cause of death um worldwide worldwide is strokes it's a stroke [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3396.7400000000002s)]
*  that's the conclusion the stroke specifically because the large vessels block more flow downstream [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3403.46s)]
*  so you've got a two-hour window to get yourself to the right hospital but even in the u.s. only five [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3411.54s)]
*  percent of the hospitals can do the procedure so by law you go to the nearest hospital so your [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3417.86s)]
*  odds are five percent of getting to the right hospital for the treatment you need to live [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3423.1400000000003s)]
*  so for heart attack there's an ekg you put on your test find out if you've got a heart attack [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3428.42s)]
*  stat you can put an ekg on your forehead that won't tell you if you're having a large vessel [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3434.34s)]
*  collision stroke so we created um a system so far with 151 patients at pan and brown in the calf lab [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3438.58s)]
*  that's what they call the place they do the thrombectomy a thrombectomy is basically you [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3445.94s)]
*  snake a catheter up your carotid artery and pull the clot out it literally is a plumbing problem [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3450.82s)]
*  the drugs don't work because it's too big of a clot and the implications of that large vessel [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3457.3s)]
*  being occluded for too long if you've got a two-hour window if not if you do live you're [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3463.06s)]
*  probably not going to walk or talk again or have a job and the brain tissue dies yeah the brain [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3467.86s)]
*  tissues you lose a third of a hemisphere on it easily if and and and so your device there can [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3472.42s)]
*  actually determine whether there's a clot where the yeah we're able to see it with this specificity [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3478.34s)]
*  and sensitivity this this purple line now using ai 151 patients brown and pan in the cath lab [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3484.66s)]
*  with mimics we can also see seizures they have a different um different mimic we're also looking at [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3490.66s)]
*  capillary blood flow as well with this because we can see blood flow very accurately [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3498.26s)]
*  so we we funded that for a few years and the vision here is put this device in every ambulance [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3502.6600000000003s)]
*  because it's cheap and the ambulance can know this guy's got a stroke going take them to this other [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3509.2200000000003s)]
*  hospital that can put them in a cath lab right and call the cath lab while you're at it so they can [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3515.38s)]
*  set it up while save minutes in process like seriously those doctors know more about their [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3521.62s)]
*  uber eats orders than when they're going to get the next patient life-saving treatment [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3527.7799999999997s)]
*  so we can use technology to improve that so yes we've got that that working uh to that extent we've [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3532.66s)]
*  finished that level of clinical trials we send it to the fda they want 10 000 more patients and [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3539.2999999999997s)]
*  you're like it's 40 or 70 000 dollars per patient that's a lot of money so what do you do you get [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3543.94s)]
*  stuck on this the the that's why i say that we've got great technology really great technology but [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3550.66s)]
*  the business model is also necessary maybe all startups are great technology combined with a new [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3555.94s)]
*  business model so hi you know let's talk about that because um so first of all i just want to [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3561.22s)]
*  frame this the technology that you have you brought together it's just converging exponential [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3567.3799999999997s)]
*  technologies this is this is new chips cameras ai 3d printing it's it's basically the materialization [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3573.54s)]
*  of physics that enable you to see and manipulate what's going on inside your body inside the brain [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3584.42s)]
*  that's going to impact stroke the number two killer in the planet it's going to allow us to [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3592.58s)]
*  address glioblastomas and other aggressive cancers the cancers that [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3597.38s)]
*  are killing us very rapidly that we don't have cures for it's going to now enable us to support [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3602.58s)]
*  those with mental disorders and with addictions i mean that's a massive moon shot my friend [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3608.9s)]
*  and you've made it farming healthy cells so these lines all went through autopsy at charles river [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3615.86s)]
*  and unlike chemotherapy or radiation therapy or even surgery they could find no healthy cells [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3622.26s)]
*  harmed because they don't have the same resonant frequencies so you're selectively picking up [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3628.7400000000002s)]
*  the cancer cells or the neurons without selecting the others and of course we can also focus [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3634.1800000000003s)]
*  where we wish to in the body unlike a drug that spreads all over i love that and what people don't [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3641.38s)]
*  know is one of your early visions here and we'll get to that eventually is that you can use this [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3647.86s)]
*  technology to read and write onto neurons so it is a version of brain computer interface without [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3652.9s)]
*  drilling holes in your head right which we're doing we're writing neurons now we're writing [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3659.6200000000003s)]
*  them for mental disease but we go to thoughts you know real quick i've been getting the most [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3664.58s)]
*  unusual compliments lately on my skin truth is i use a lotion every morning and every night [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3669.94s)]
*  religiously called one skin it was developed by four phd women who determined a 10 amino acid [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3676.42s)]
*  sequence that is a synolytic that kills senile cells in your skin and this literally reverses [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3683.38s)]
*  the age of your skin and i think it's one of the most incredible products i use it all the time [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3690.1s)]
*  if you're interested check out the show notes i've asked my team to link to it below all right let's [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3696.1s)]
*  get back to the episode so i think the business model which goes to the name open water is you [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3700.34s)]
*  recently took a you recently took in a large grant from a well-known crypto technologist [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3708.34s)]
*  talk about that talk about this new approach to to business that has really given you wings [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3720.7400000000002s)]
*  uh he reached out he is who uh vitalik buterin who is the founder of ethereum and a math genius [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3726.5s)]
*  and uh very successful it's a very successful cryptocurrency he's the most visible person the [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3737.14s)]
*  guy satoshi with bitcoin he's disappeared so vitalik is a face of it he had a bunch of [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3742.4199999999996s)]
*  shibu ina coin and he sold it when elon went on saturday night live in 2021 because he realized [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3750.34s)]
*  he had like 10 billion dollars worth of it and he um dumped a lot into dead wallets but anyway he [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3756.26s)]
*  was looking for help on covid so he called me i'm like if i could have done any help on covid i would [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3763.06s)]
*  have dropped everything in early 2020 he's like no i think he can do it so it just started talking [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3769.3s)]
*  to him like 10 o'clock friday nights my time zone i don't know where he was and you know he'd ask [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3775.06s)]
*  these really good questions so i'd end up spending the weekend thinking about it right a few pages [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3781.2999999999997s)]
*  and it just continued where we realized we should take the company open source and maybe we could [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3785.38s)]
*  help with covid and long covid and many other diseases the disease is accelerated by covid [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3790.02s)]
*  if you look at some of the early data that has come in like a study of 54 000 veterans [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3795.54s)]
*  it's uh it's uh amazing the the risk of neurodegenerative disease doubles if you've [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3801.38s)]
*  had long covid uh the risk of heart failure goes up 173 stroke 164 percent et cetera et cetera [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3807.38s)]
*  and also we think we can help in long covid because we can see blood flow if you drop covid [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3815.14s)]
*  into a vial of blood you get these microclots those are probably not since they're 10 to 100 [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3819.54s)]
*  microns in size they're not making it through the capillaries again i'm just a physicist but [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3824.26s)]
*  makes sense to me there's an issue there so at any rate so we decided um to open source the company [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3828.98s)]
*  and we took a 50 million dollar you decided to i mean it's very important here this is a this is [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3836.42s)]
*  going open source with your fundamental technology right all 68 of our patents um [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3842.42s)]
*  all of our software all of our hardware um open source agpl so it it it continues open source [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3850.4199999999996s)]
*  and what i think that does is break this 600 and this is 658 million dollars is the average [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3860.02s)]
*  capitalized cost to get a new device just a regulatory approval in the u.s. as averaged [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3866.58s)]
*  over every single one that's done it in the last 30 years but in 2024 dollars it's staggering [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3873.94s)]
*  and what's really interesting here is that 85 percent of that cost is actually the device [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3880.66s)]
*  development it's not the trials if you take that there's another seven percent if you share safety [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3886.18s)]
*  data but if you can create a platform a low-cost platform that we could so we have those carts a [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3891.38s)]
*  year ago we've now reduced them to this size and cost those carts were 100 to a half a million [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3898.26s)]
*  dollars these are 10 000 going to a thousand dollars people can buy them open source is a [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3903.94s)]
*  distribution model but it's a trust model so we have everybody lots and lots of people buying [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3911.6200000000003s)]
*  these things for r and d to get their regulatory approval the regulatory approval become like apps [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3918.1000000000004s)]
*  on an android phone so you know the those companies can make some money on it but [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3924.34s)]
*  everybody keeps everybody honest they make any money like guess what consumer electronics and [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3929.78s)]
*  and and technology make money like literally 20 years ago the top five companies in the world [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3935.86s)]
*  were oil and gas they're now tech the magnificent seven you know like we can make money on it but [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3941.3s)]
*  why not like make it up on volume and save more lives for less money so vitalic says listen if [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3946.26s)]
*  you open source this i will give you 50 million dollars essentially although there was a lot more [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3951.46s)]
*  discussion of how we could help in covid and other things and it was a long discussion i went to [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3958.26s)]
*  zulu a couple times that was his uh anyway it was fantastic but he's just shibu eating coin [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3963.38s)]
*  that's super key didn't sell any ethereum he just people had gifted when you're sort of a famous [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3970.82s)]
*  crypto he had gotten it and he wanted to use it for his charities we're not a charity but we are [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3975.94s)]
*  open sourcing all of our technology so but i you know i think like one of the reasons one laptop [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3982.5s)]
*  per child couldn't succeed is we had no way to make money because we we sold it at cost so we [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3989.94s)]
*  couldn't sustain where if we just added an extra ten dollars that could have solved it too but i [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=3998.7400000000002s)]
*  think a for-profit entity that's open source is maybe a better solution and i wanted to try that [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4004.34s)]
*  so i convinced all my investors to say yes at the same time and at the beginning i literally had to [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4011.06s)]
*  hold the phone really far away because they thought open source equals charity yeah but it's not any [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4016.6600000000003s)]
*  way i could do the business model it was a 10x to 100x more revenue with this 10x to 100x more [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4022.1800000000003s)]
*  margin than any other approach i could find because i mean it feels like we were talking [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4030.18s)]
*  in september at dinner it feels like logan's run like nobody actually makes it like it takes too [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4037.2999999999997s)]
*  long everybody dies like getting these things out if you're a small company but a medtronic or a ge [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4042.2599999999998s)]
*  or uh you know phillips they can take a hundred a thousand shots on goal so even if somebody has [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4049.06s)]
*  trouble like they some of them get through and i think you need through the regulatory process [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4054.8199999999997s)]
*  because it's biology is unpredictable we want more data about biology this is a way to get more [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4060.1s)]
*  data on the same platform iso 13485 low cost i mean right now people make a cart get regulatory [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4065.2999999999997s)]
*  approval on it and then have to shrink it and then they have to go through the same process again [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4072.18s)]
*  they go through it for like 20 30 i love a few things you've said i've heard you say that you're [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4075.7s)]
*  basically about to use silicon and software to replace drugs yeah silicon hospital we think [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4080.34s)]
*  silicon hospital is in reach and we've got some good data on on cancers and mental disease and [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4086.42s)]
*  neurodegenerative disease also longevity stuff and you know chronic diseases like diabetes and so [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4092.42s)]
*  forth by basically being able to activate certain cells and also monitor and see we have some [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4100.1s)]
*  imaging technology we put on the back shelf for a while because we could realize we could ship [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4109.22s)]
*  these faster but we also think like ultimately we can replace the MRI machine with also a wearable [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4112.820000000001s)]
*  that's that's low cost that leverages a lot of the technology we're building out in these two units [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4119.38s)]
*  right now so i want to set the vision of where things are going because i think what's beautiful [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4124.1s)]
*  here is the same the same technology the same physics the same chip sets that are in those [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4132.1s)]
*  materials in in those devices you've identified with different software can give you different [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4139.06s)]
*  therapeutics and different diagnostics right and so if you can put those your tech open waters tech [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4146.1s)]
*  into the hands of thousands of labs and scientists around the world they'll find novel uses for it [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4154.98s)]
*  new approaches and governments so we're working with governments the ministries of health [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4162.82s)]
*  and big companies and little companies and they can trust it like whatever we if we overcharge [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4168.5s)]
*  or try to guide them for us they can go to another manufacturer and get it made we still have a really [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4174.339999999999s)]
*  good business you know right now nobody can make these we've made the plans but you know [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4178.66s)]
*  elon open sources patents for the rockets like go ahead spend the money and open sources for [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4188.18s)]
*  for the charging stations for tesla yeah or you know just boeing could open source all of [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4194.0199999999995s)]
*  its stuff like it's still hard to make this stuff and design it so we're just pushing the envelope [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4200.26s)]
*  but the problem is people are dying in the process we can make it up on volume let's just [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4205.14s)]
*  work together like we do in consumer electronics it seems really obvious we've got some data that's [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4209.860000000001s)]
*  very promising there's a million papers scientific papers published in the last 20 years about using [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4215.9400000000005s)]
*  infrared light ultrasound electromagnetics to treat hundreds of different diseases it's literally a [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4222.1s)]
*  rounding error to say zero zero get into people get into the health care system [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4228.74s)]
*  and that's because of the 658 million dollars in 13 years and so we have to break that mold too [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4235.7s)]
*  to move it on to a different pathway i'm from consumer electronics we ship me every year or [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4243.62s)]
*  two honestly a complex project's a two-year project so when will we see when will we see these being [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4249.7s)]
*  sold to labs and governments they're they're taking order reservations on our website because [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4256.1s)]
*  we can't sell a non-fda approved thing without a document because this is a research device [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4262.900000000001s)]
*  but we're selling on them the reservations on our website the first one we'll ship out this month [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4269.620000000001s)]
*  so end of 24 early june 25 in q2 amazing of the shrink thanks to vitalik's gift we were able to [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4275.06s)]
*  take the money and shrink it down we thought it was important because it is seems like a general [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4284.42s)]
*  purpose platform so i love remember the the the movie uh brainstorm yeah i do and they had this [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4288.58s)]
*  giant device for being able to read and write onto neurons and they shrunk it down to some small [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4297.86s)]
*  device you'd stick on your head and i viewed that as what you're what you're doing i mean you're [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4302.18s)]
*  about to unleash an entire revolution um yeah so what else what else haven't we covered that you [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4309.3s)]
*  want to go a few other things in the personal yeah i've got a few i've got this presentation [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4316.42s)]
*  i can sort of get rid of it but i think this is the idea is flip it on its side so many people [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4320.34s)]
*  like different companies different organizations health cares can treat hundreds of diseases in [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4325.54s)]
*  parallel that lowers the cost of hardware and it gets us more safety data on that platform that [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4330.58s)]
*  we all get to share so we can make it more safe safety and efficacy are important but you don't [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4335.38s)]
*  get approval so this open source thing it's really it enables volume um we make money it's a cross [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4342.02s)]
*  thing we people ask they're like you're nuts and i mean like well if you make more of something [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4348.1s)]
*  it's cheaper it's approximately for every 10x more you make something it's it's a slight [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4352.900000000001s)]
*  exaggeration to say it's 10x cheaper we enjoy a portion of that savings as our profit that's it [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4357.22s)]
*  that's it's android story it's what android did yes yes or quality like there's nothing quality [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4363.38s)]
*  about a 10 unit build that's what the fda considers a 10 unit build literally 20 years ago as you [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4370.5s)]
*  mentioned i was cto of a division that intel our minimum sample size build was 10 000 units [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4375.62s)]
*  but this enables innovation because the best products go through the most iterations and [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4383.54s)]
*  you can leverage the product and it also engenders trust and you get a massive amount of data [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4388.58s)]
*  just a massive amount of data yes we get to use the tools of our time for ai too to see more [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4394.26s)]
*  things and different people will do better and well you know it'll move back and forth but we [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4400.34s)]
*  break this cycle this anti-innovation cycle of 20 to 40 year motes in health care while people are [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4404.34s)]
*  literally dying by the millions of these diseases so that's where i get to like how do we and so [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4412.5s)]
*  there's so much talent how do we try this so yes vitalik helped helped us try it and i convinced [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4419.14s)]
*  all of our investors to say yes at the same time and we signed the deal so it's done we're open [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4426.74s)]
*  source now and forever open waters open source how appropriate that's great yeah i'm trying to think [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4432.82s)]
*  what else i have so here's i want to have a couple of a couple of personal questions here if you [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4437.94s)]
*  don't mind sure i want to know about your childhood your dad i heard you say once your dad helped you [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4442.259999999999s)]
*  learn how to fix things how to build things right yeah talking about that and um he uh that wasn't [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4449.46s)]
*  enough money so my dad started this automotive repair business um he rebuilt car engines so i [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4457.46s)]
*  was a little kid and i could shimmy under the car and probably get child protective services now [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4463.94s)]
*  but you know you figure stuff out and you know i we plowed i grew up in new england we plowed the [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4468.9s)]
*  neighbor's driveways when it snowed and that ended up me me trying to figure out how to [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4475.62s)]
*  get the tractor to start up and get the plow on and all you know just all that stuff so you just [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4482.259999999999s)]
*  sort of learned how to do that you learn how to tinker and build yeah my dad was that he grew up [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4486.82s)]
*  on a farm you know like everybody didn't have jobs there so he was in that transition as [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4492.66s)]
*  americans went out of many of them and especially in england you know the midwest [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4497.94s)]
*  lasted longer we didn't have who taught you art um really was your mom i loved art it was to me it [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4502.9s)]
*  was the same thing and that's where i came to in engineering um i just loved it there was actually [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4509.22s)]
*  literally the the governor of canada kits sister was my art teacher in elementary school [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4516.9s)]
*  random elegroso had just come in my parents hated elegroso they didn't like the art teacher either [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4524.74s)]
*  i liked the art teacher and i thought it was fun and i went to one of these schools um that [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4529.78s)]
*  not to date myself but um i started i think kindergarten 1970 sorry 65 um [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4537.379999999999s)]
*  um literally um they had started this the public elementary school in my district and we weren't in [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4543.46s)]
*  a rich or fancy town we weren't rich um was uh continuous progress you could just do what you [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4550.58s)]
*  wanted be how you feel and i just did math and art and that's what i wanted to do so i was doing [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4555.38s)]
*  like i think calculus by fifth sixth grade but then i'd spend a lot of time in the art room [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4564.34s)]
*  because i like enjoyed that too like because math is visual i know there's the the music genius [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4569.86s)]
*  music math geniuses that think of it in terms of music i just really like you also were you [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4576.179999999999s)]
*  played in the band didn't you i did but not i wasn't good what did you play were you a singer [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4582.66s)]

*  rocker well it's their age is fun and then i heard you met andy warhol when was that oh yeah um i [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4596.66s)]
*  well i took all these art classes when i started college my parents didn't grow up rich and they [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4604.5s)]
*  wanted um me to be able to support myself so they said they'd help me get pay for the best college i [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4608.98s)]
*  could get into if and only if i majored in electrical engineering i thought sure [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4617.46s)]
*  um i started and i thought it would have killed any ounce of creativity i ever have i might have [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4621.94s)]
*  had and i'm not saying i had much it was so dry it was so boring um like inclined planes [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4628.419999999999s)]
*  so they like you spend a whole semester on f equals zero then you spend the next semester on [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4638.66s)]
*  f equals ma and it's just it's boring i found it very boring very dry so i started taking these [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4643.78s)]
*  art classes i was at brown is an undergraduate rizdi's next door everybody says the best part [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4650.1s)]
*  it's a famous art school the best part about brown is rizdi the best part of rizdi is brown [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4654.58s)]
*  i think they're both great but i started taking them and it turns out like i just did it to [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4658.820000000001s)]
*  maintain my sanity it's not like i could afford a therapy or anything like that i took art courses [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4663.9400000000005s)]
*  and i ended up finishing all of the classes for a second degree in art but they wouldn't give it to [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4669.14s)]
*  me because i had to pay for five years i only paid for four but later after i got the phd i then got [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4674.82s)]
*  an honorary phd and they gave me the art degree then i didn't have to pay for it and i got the [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4682.179999999999s)]
*  honorary i think that is well well because i already had a real phd it's not a big risk you [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4687.219999999999s)]
*  know well well deserved you know one of the things i talk about um is going from success to [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4692.42s)]
*  significance um and the you know so much of of entrepreneurs measure themselves by their stock [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4697.86s)]
*  price or the amount of money they raised or you know a bunch of different elements can you just [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4706.259999999999s)]
*  speak to the entrepreneurs who are uh listening who are you know want to do big bold significant [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4712.74s)]
*  things in life what's your advice to them figure out a new way to do it you know i just was thinking [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4720.179999999999s)]
*  about people keep asking first principles i always thought it was the first principle thing [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4725.06s)]
*  maxwell's equations but i think maybe the bigger answer to this is read history read history of [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4728.740000000001s)]

*  unfundable i had to get whatever ra i could i got one with a history of science professor for a while [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4744.18s)]
*  and it was building equipment um creating kits for the students and then later got nasa to do this [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4750.740000000001s)]
*  for elementary schools in rod island etc um of like a newtonian telescope a cali on telescope [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4758.02s)]
*  there's reasons people didn't believe gallo they were hard to look through when you look at what [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4764.660000000001s)]
*  the greats walked through uh faraday gallo franklin ben or rosalind you know both like you um [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4770.34s)]
*  have this impression that it was always that it was easier than or something it was never easy [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4780.18s)]
*  and people just decided to do it and they just you just work on it because you love it you're [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4784.58s)]
*  passionate about it and you you know you think you're gonna die if you don't and if you're not [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4788.660000000001s)]
*  i hope you're gonna go there because i i do think that if you're gonna do something that's big bold [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4794.02s)]
*  and significant you know i like to say they're overnight successes after 11 years of hard work [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4800.02s)]
*  you have to love it and you if you don't love the job you should do something else because you do [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4804.58s)]
*  have to spend all your time on it so you you know i get up in the i can't sleep i get up to work on [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4810.58s)]

*  on it i work all the time i love it um it's hard to stop me from working well you're not working [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4822.9s)]
*  you're you're you're playing you're having fun you're fulfilling your purpose in life [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4828.34s)]
*  right what can you do so you should feel that way about it and then i guess you know another [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4832.82s)]
*  question so yeah first principles what are first principles like oxford gave a fine if you diverged [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4837.14s)]
*  from aristotelian theory at the time that Galileo and newton were making their breakthroughs [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4843.9400000000005s)]
*  good thing they weren't at oxford right like we still have rules against thinking like it's just [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4849.22s)]
*  crazy but so you have to find there's always these barriers you have to find and it's not first [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4854.34s)]
*  principles it's sort of looking at what's been overlooked like and so when i work at something [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4860.18s)]
*  i look i go way back as far as i can go to present day go back 50 years and see what people have [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4865.9400000000005s)]
*  missed the first principles things well there's a lot of principles and so which ones do you pick [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4872.26s)]
*  and which how do you see it can you find a new way through it given what we have now all that [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4878.34s)]
*  we have access to now people abandoned it 20 30 50 years ago can we pick that back up [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4884.82s)]
*  you know mash up different things that's one thing the other thing that bugs me is the common thing [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4892.099999999999s)]
*  people ask you as a startup they say how big is your company like well how do you measure big [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4896.9s)]
*  and they usually measure it one way how many employees you have it's the wrong question it's [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4901.94s)]
*  the wrong answer you know i just tell them but you know it is the wrong answer it shouldn't be the [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4906.58s)]
*  number of employees what should it be how big you are is it the size the scale of your desired [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4911.38s)]
*  impact number of people you're touching yeah how big um maybe they want to know i suppose if they're [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4921.7s)]
*  interested in the company they'd like to know revenue and and income should be the demand or [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4930.66s)]
*  total shareholder return you know if you're on the board or something but in terms of of the start [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4936.1s)]
*  and the potential i suppose it should be measured with the potential and what the roadmap is [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4941.3s)]
*  should be would be interesting more interesting but maybe they're trying to assess burn rate [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4946.18s)]
*  because that is a good measure with the number of employees and where they're based i suppose [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4953.06s)]
*  are you glad that you didn't pursue open water um straight out of intel or straight out of one [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4957.540000000001s)]
*  laptop and you waited till now or till 2016 it seems like the tech became enabled in the [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4963.78s)]
*  last few years it's really the convergence you know the theme so you're going to be on stage [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4973.46s)]
*  with me at the abundance 360 summit in march which i'm excited about and the theme this year [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4977.54s)]
*  is convergence and if i think about a technology which is the embodiment of convergence i would [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4981.94s)]
*  say what open water does is is that wow thanks yeah i think we could have made some impact in [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4988.98s)]
*  2004 when i finally had you know my feet underneath myself after my brain tumor took years [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=4996.179999999999s)]
*  honestly to recover that and design a better me and it's a longer story but on the medications [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5003.379999999999s)]
*  that i take and getting those right it was a big fight um i could have started it then [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5011.06s)]
*  i just it was such an opportunity to partner with nicholas and then the the opportunity to work with [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5019.9400000000005s)]
*  sergue and google and then with mark were such big opportunities and and we were supposed to do it [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5025.54s)]
*  it's just the realities of business where they run they were responsible for these big business [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5032.42s)]
*  so i understood so i hope i love i enjoy the work i just knew that it could be applied to the body [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5037.46s)]
*  and i suppose yes by waiting yeah mores we've gotten more cycles of moore's law so it's easier [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5044.42s)]
*  to make these things and also the manufacturing infrastructure is easier to use than ever before [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5050.1s)]
*  maybe because i've been through it so many times like you don't need actually a lot of people [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5056.74s)]
*  because you use contract manufacturing for a lot of it and you have these teams all over the place [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5061.14s)]
*  and this communication that's um transcends i think the traditional build your own factory [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5067.3s)]
*  build your own everything it takes a long time to build those and so you can turn it on and turn [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5073.78s)]
*  it off quickly and and move to different factories should you find issues but that's a detail mary [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5078.42s)]

*  you're going to give the scientific crowd a new iphone equivalent um yeah that's the thing to build [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5213.3s)]
*  apps on top of and that's another reason why it's open source because they're like well i don't trust [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5219.62s)]
*  you know like it's competitive like everybody has access everyone can use it and we haven't talked [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5224.74s)]
*  about the implications of ai on top of all of this right because these these systems are going to [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5229.94s)]
*  generate massive amounts of data you might be able to understand a lot more about biology and [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5236.18s)]
*  you'll certainly understand a lot more about safety and efficacy and the brain right and the [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5240.9s)]
*  brain and read write you know 100 billion neurons 100 trillion synoptic connections and it's still [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5246.66s)]
*  very much a black box and you're building the telescope i'm going to call that's what i'm [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5253.38s)]
*  coping with the telescope for the brain or the microscope into the brain it really is i mean i [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5258.42s)]
*  showed live on stage at ted i think in 2018 focusing through bone and flesh we didn't get to use real [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5264.18s)]
*  bone and flesh because there was a it's in canada there was a rule against it so we use phantom [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5271.7s)]
*  tissue but we focus to a micron live on stage and what does a micron buy you in terms of [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5278.42s)]
*  a single neuron so or we can groups of neurons groups of neurons are really useful for mental [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5286.02s)]
*  disease which is and neurodegenerative disease so that is the focus of our first products but [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5292.1s)]
*  we have a lot of technology that we've opened to the world people can push it forward we'll help [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5297.78s)]
*  can do lots of different things i can't wait for my i mean i can imagine everybody having one of [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5302.82s)]
*  these systems at home and they can pine the app i want to be happier i want to get better sleep [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5308.9s)]
*  i mean there's going to be anything that your brain in you know implements or impacts right and [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5315.7s)]
*  you can get through clinical trials easier because everybody can have this at home so you can try it [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5323.7s)]
*  more easily we have you know surveillance systems in our home like cameras and microphones so we can [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5328.18s)]
*  see how the effects are and and measure them and collect more like you know my watch tracker my [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5335.22s)]
*  heart rate monitor it's accurate to plus or minus 25 but if you imagine that across millions rather [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5343.54s)]
*  than you know you look at clinical trials people do 20 people 70 i was looking at a company last [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5352.18s)]
*  night they've done 10 years old they've done 76 patients insane that's it yeah like how can you [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5357.06s)]
*  draw as many full conclusions yes right or have the impact given you know how much they've spent [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5364.02s)]
*  you know whatever they spend 100 million dollars they've done 76 patients and they've got a long [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5371.38s)]
*  road to hoe to get through approval processes which probably will need 10 000 patients and so [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5375.54s)]
*  you're just stuck we can't get any therapies unless we can get more people to try it how do [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5383.38s)]
*  you make sure it's safe i mean i think there's many of these things that look safe and people [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5388.179999999999s)]
*  say well you're using a different frequency releasing one frequency what if what if and it's [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5393.38s)]
*  like well yeah okay great what should we do should we do we have to do this all in the hospital do [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5398.82s)]
*  we have to do this all in a university i mean that's where you get to spending 40 to 70 000 [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5405.54s)]
*  dollars per patient and then the numbers become astronomical or do you work with the ministry of [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5412.5s)]
*  health of a middle-income country who's who would like to own the regulatory or do you get 10 000 [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5417.46s)]
*  of these you get 10 000 100 000 of these units out there and people say i want to be part of that [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5423.06s)]
*  trial right and then they send to their homes and so forth and and they can they can do the trial [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5428.1s)]
*  there or they can do it at the ministry of health who then owns the regulatory approval and then they [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5434.34s)]
*  do what they feel has been done to them by big pharma for example so you know it gets interesting [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5439.14s)]
*  when a country can own the regulatory approvals and i can't wait to see where you are in march [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5447.14s)]
*  and then next year i want to come back and go deeper into the early results and talk about [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5453.14s)]
*  writing and reading onto neurons of your brain so openwater.health and on on xmljmljmlj [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LETaMbq4GtE&t=5459.62s)]
