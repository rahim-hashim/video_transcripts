# A Data-Backed Approach To Perfect Sleep w/ Tom Hale (Oura CEO) and Dr. Rebecca Robbins | EP #73
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [November 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs)
*  How much sleep do we need and why is it important? There's really a sweet spot [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=0.0s)]
*  when it comes to sleep duration. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=4.68s)]
*  We know that if you don't get enough sleep that your incidence of a car crash [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=11.68s)]
*  will only increase. 33% increase for sleep-deprived folks and that actually [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=15.68s)]
*  gets dramatically worse the more sleep-deprived you are. How do you feel [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=19.68s)]
*  when you wake up and if you wake up and you tell me you don't feel refreshed and [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=23.36s)]
*  restored by your sleep? Odds are the quality wasn't very high. If you don't [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=27.3s)]
*  sleep well you're 20% more likely to suffer a heart attack. The question is [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=31.18s)]
*  can you get yourself good night's sleep without any supplements, without any [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=34.14s)]
*  medications? It's concerning because we just don't know the long-term [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=37.66s)]
*  implications of this. Breathing and counting are super underestimated in the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=40.7s)]
*  toolkit because both of those things put your body, you know, your physiology into [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=46.3s)]
*  a restful state. Sleep is sort of like this universal superpower that if you [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=50.82s)]
*  can harness and you can access it benefits almost every dimension of your life. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=54.94s)]
*  Hi everybody Peter Diamandis here. This episode is brought to you by X-Prize. I [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=58.58s)]

*  when Burt Rutan built Spaceship One and flew it a hundred kilometers into space. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=98.94000000000001s)]

*  Everybody welcome to Moonshots and Mindsets. This session is one of my [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=112.66000000000001s)]
*  favorites. It's a conversation about something I care deeply about and I talk [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=116.58000000000001s)]
*  a lot about and it's about sleep. And I have two incredible people with me, a CEO [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=120.62s)]
*  and a scientist that surround Aura and are all about helping you today get a [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=127.22s)]
*  evergreen toolkit on how to have a great night's sleep. So Tom, a pleasure. Rebecca, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=134.70000000000002s)]
*  a pleasure to have you both. So Tom, where are you on the planet today? I'm in [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=141.1s)]
*  San Francisco, California. Sunny and bright. Nice and Dr. Rebecca Robbins, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=145.78s)]
*  yourself? I'm calling in from Boston. Also sunny, thank goodness. So first of [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=150.46s)]
*  all, I love my Aura Ring and I got my best night's sleep ever last night. I scored [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=156.98s)]
*  a 97 on my Aura Ring which I've never had before, not even close. So it was [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=162.46s)]
*  something about prepping for this session. So we'll talk about that in the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=167.34s)]
*  last segment here. But before we jump into that, my goal here is in the course [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=171.02s)]
*  of this hour to give those individuals who suffer from too little sleep or [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=176.5s)]
*  inadequate or sleep that doesn't revive and refresh a how-to on the basics of [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=183.1s)]
*  sleep so that they can get that superpower as well. So let's jump into [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=190.22s)]
*  part one here for me which is the basics and also the medications around sleep. So [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=195.54s)]
*  first of all, the basics. How much sleep do we need and why is it important? Let's [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=201.06s)]
*  get down to that because there's a big debate about can I get away with five [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=205.72s)]
*  hours, six hours, do I need eight hours, and why the heck is sleep so important [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=208.98s)]
*  to health and longevity? Rebecca, do you want to kick that off? So great question, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=213.54s)]
*  Peter. You've hit on one of the tenets of sleep health which is duration. We kind [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=219.74s)]
*  of often lament that it's kind of the front runner, right? We're all so focused [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=226.14000000000001s)]
*  on how much sleep we're getting. And sleep duration is part of the equation. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=229.9s)]
*  For the vast majority of adults, 99% of us do best have the best health [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=233.3s)]
*  kind of through and through from mood to chronic disease profiles in the range of [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=239.18s)]
*  seven to nine hours. So below that we see risks and interestingly we also see [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=245.66s)]
*  risks when sleepers are, individuals are consistently getting longer than the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=250.29999999999998s)]
*  nine hours. So there's really a sweet spot when it comes to sleep duration. So [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=254.94s)]
*  unfortunately the vast majority of us are not meeting that sleep need. We do [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=260.94s)]
*  have some good data to show that only about 35% get sufficient sleep so [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=265.82s)]
*  meet their number each and every night. Now in addition to sleep duration, there [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=270.64s)]
*  are also kind of other elements of sleep that are really important to [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=275.06s)]
*  consider. And one of them is how do you feel when you wake up? And if you wake up [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=278.6s)]
*  and you tell me you don't feel refreshed and restored by your sleep, odds are the [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=283.54s)]
*  quality wasn't very high. And so that could be stemming from a number of [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=287.62s)]
*  different issues. Maybe you had too much caffeine the day before, maybe you had [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=291.22s)]
*  too much stress that you weren't managing over the course of the day, maybe [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=294.22s)]
*  you drank too much before bedtime or had a you know took an extra glass of wine [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=297.7s)]
*  and we'll get into that in a little bit but there are a lot of things that go [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=301.78000000000003s)]
*  into that quality equation that allow us to wake up and be refreshed and [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=305.14s)]
*  restored. So there are a couple aspects that go into that question of what is [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=310.38s)]
*  sleep and the next question of why is it so important? We have so much data to [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=314.14s)]
*  show that sleep is truly the cornerstone of our truly health and performance. When [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=319.66s)]
*  we're not getting enough good quality restorative sleep, we all can attest we [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=325.3s)]
*  wake up and we feel groggy, we're kind of burdened by what we call kind of brain [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=329.62s)]
*  fog, we're less productive, we're less likely to seek creative solutions to [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=333.7s)]
*  complex problems. In business context we have good quality data that we [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=337.34000000000003s)]
*  underperform but we also make fewer ethical decisions. We're more risk-prone [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=341.98s)]
*  as opposed to risk-averse and kind of keeping the long term in mind when [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=346.74s)]
*  you're well rested. So there are a host of kind of adverse things that happen [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=350.78000000000003s)]
*  when we're not meeting that target need from kind of cognitive to [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=356.18s)]
*  physical health starts to deteriorate. Even your immunity goes down right? You're more likely to get sick if you don't sleep well. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=360.94s)]
*  You know I like to think about it is if evolution could have done away with one [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=367.02s)]
*  or two hours of sleep, you know, where you're not foraging, you're not [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=372.98s)]
*  protecting yourself, it would have and we need those seven to nine. Tom, anything [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=377.86s)]
*  you want to add there? You know I would just call out that fatigue is the flip [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=383.3s)]
*  side of sleep right and fatigue you know we know that if you don't get enough [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=387.18s)]
*  sleep that your incidence of a car crash will increase 33% increase for [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=390.86s)]
*  sleep-deprived folks and that actually gets dramatically worse the more [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=395.58s)]
*  sleep-deprived you are. It's almost worse than drinking. You know many [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=399.02s)]
*  accidents are thought of as drunk driving but they're actually people who [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=402.98s)]
*  are sleep-deprived. We know that it's 70% more likely to sustain a workplace [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=405.82s)]
*  accident if you're not well slept. That's the cost side. Then you think about [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=409.38s)]
*  the opportunity. People who have you know better sleep have better health and I [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=413.21999999999997s)]
*  think that's maybe the key here is when you think about heart health for [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=417.7s)]
*  example. You know if you don't sleep well you're 20% more likely to suffer a [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=421.46s)]
*  heart attack. Conversely American Health Association believes that sleep is one [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=424.98s)]
*  of the foundations of long-term heart health. You mentioned immunity 30% [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=428.21999999999997s)]
*  more likely to catch a cold. So sleep is sort of like this universal [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=432.86s)]
*  superpower that if you can harness and you can access it benefits almost every [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=436.74s)]
*  dimension of your life. Yeah I think it is as a tenant of longevity which we [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=441.26s)]
*  speak a lot about on this on this podcast. So 79 hours sleep it's [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=444.38s)]
*  important for your health every aspect of it. So now the question becomes how do [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=448.53999999999996s)]
*  you get it? We're gonna spend the rest of the show having that conversation. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=451.86s)]
*  Unfortunately a lot of people turn to drugs to Ambien to Lunesta to other [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=454.82s)]
*  supplements. Some supplements are useful and and and additive. I was having [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=460.82s)]
*  dinner with with Elon Musk last Sunday and he said he finally kicked Ambien. He [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=466.78s)]
*  said it was hell on the third day. And you know can you talk a little bit about [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=470.9s)]
*  drugs like Ambien and Lunesta and just the the addiction and the the detriment [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=476.46s)]
*  of that. I want people to realize it's not a panacea. Totally. What an outtray to a [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=485.70000000000005s)]
*  conversation last night over dinner with Elon Musk. Peter I love it. So great great [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=491.06s)]
*  point and great question. Essentially that's a classification of sleep aids, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=497.90000000000003s)]
*  the pharmacological aids that in some cases can literally be a godsend. So [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=501.62s)]
*  there's definitely a time and a place individual suffering from grief could be [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=506.18s)]
*  a good example or prolonged stress or other issues. And so of course it's an [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=510.18s)]
*  issue to kind of speak to your doctor about if you're in the kind of in the [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=515.02s)]
*  zone that would require that type of type of intervention. But generally [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=519.46s)]
*  speaking they we want to look at those as a kind of a band-aid. So they're [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=522.9s)]
*  getting you through a period of time that is extremely difficult to get [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=526.38s)]
*  through. And then when you're on the other side of that then we can start to [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=529.5s)]
*  taper and then start to think of behavioral strategies. But what's so [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=532.6999999999999s)]
*  interesting if we take individuals that are truly suffering from chronic [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=536.98s)]
*  insomnia and we take them we do randomized controlled trials where we [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=541.34s)]
*  put one group on the pharmacological intervention, Ambien-Lunesta the like. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=545.7800000000001s)]
*  The other group gets intensive behavioral therapy called cognitive [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=549.7800000000001s)]
*  behavioral therapy for insomnia. What's so interesting in the clinical trials [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=553.62s)]
*  that have looked at these two components both do very well almost equally as well [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=557.62s)]
*  in the short term but in the long term behavior wins and has improved efficacy [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=563.3000000000001s)]
*  over the pharmacological intervention. So it's really this remarkable area of [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=568.78s)]
*  medicine where so many areas of medicine of course are impacted by behavior but [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=572.5s)]
*  sleep so much so. And there are dictates that we could all really learn from the [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=576.34s)]
*  tenets of CBTI that we can get into. So the other thing that we're starting to [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=581.22s)]
*  kind of notice is just the incredible surge in melatonin. Some data was [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=586.26s)]
*  published in JAMA not too long ago on this explosion in use and I think that [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=590.94s)]
*  even the reports that we have of nationally representative surveys we [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=595.86s)]
*  think are underestimating really how pervasive this use of melatonin is and [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=599.9s)]
*  it's concerning because we just don't know the long-term implications of this [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=605.1s)]
*  this supplement and it really isn't it's a nutraceutical and so it's widely [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=609.46s)]
*  unregulated this market and so we're really not sure the purity of the [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=614.1s)]
*  melatonin that is on the market but then again the long-term implications are [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=618.38s)]
*  really in question. So we need a lot more science before we really promote [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=621.9s)]
*  aids like that. Yeah people talk about one milligram, two milligrams, five [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=626.22s)]
*  milligrams, long duration or you know slow release and I guess if I were [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=630.06s)]
*  thinking about it I'd rather be using melatonin than Ambien but at the end of [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=637.6999999999999s)]
*  the day the question is can you get yourself a good night's sleep without [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=642.4599999999999s)]
*  any supplements without any medications and I think that's where I want to spend [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=645.9s)]
*  the majority of this conversation. Tom you wanted anything before we jump into [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=649.46s)]
*  that? I think it's really important to understand that melatonin is what your [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=653.26s)]
*  body produces to sort of get you off to sleep. Melatonin doesn't keep you asleep [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=656.5s)]
*  melatonin doesn't you know make you calm down or have any of the agency of a [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=661.58s)]
*  Lunez or an Ambien. Melatonin is just like the starting gun for sleep and so [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=665.9200000000001s)]
*  taking melatonin you know right before bed I think in many ways is the trigger [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=669.98s)]
*  for people to kind of signal to their body that this is time to go to bed but [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=673.74s)]
*  there's lots of other levers that you can pull you don't necessarily have to [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=677.4599999999999s)]
*  have an intervention. I'm a big believer in melatonin and I agree with the [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=680.26s)]
*  comment about nutraceuticals being unregulated but a high quality you know [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=684.66s)]
*  melatonin actually I think it can make a difference for folks who want to kind of [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=688.4599999999999s)]
*  get into a regular routine of getting sleepy right before falling asleep. And [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=692.06s)]
*  one just one important thing to add is melatonin of course isn't a sleep aid [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=696.3s)]
*  it really the most you know kind of primary use case is when individuals are [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=700.18s)]
*  trying to change a sleep schedule so if you're really out of out of sync your [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=703.98s)]
*  internal clock with the clock on the wall or a new schedule that you'd like [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=708.26s)]
*  to start perfect use case for melatonin because as Tom mentioned the melatonin [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=712.0600000000001s)]
*  that's endogenous inside the body is what allows us when the sun sets when we go [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=716.62s)]
*  into a cool dark environment to calm down and start to kind of prepare for [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=721.02s)]
*  sleep and then the floodgates of melatonin stop as soon as we wake up and [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=725.26s)]
*  we get sunlight exposure in the morning and so I think it is being marketed as [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=729.14s)]
*  this panacea this you know sleep aid this miracle drug but it really isn't so [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=733.58s)]
*  I think there's a lot more education we can do on how to use it how much when and [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=738.26s)]
*  all that with efficacy. Sure and we'll talk about sleep hygiene which is you [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=745.46s)]
*  know sort of the how to get yourself ready how you get yourself into the [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=750.3000000000001s)]
*  proper it's not just close your eyes and go to sleep before we do while we're [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=753.62s)]
*  still talking about chemicals pharmaceuticals let's talk about caffeine [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=757.5400000000001s)]
*  and alcohol first so talk to me about your advice for everybody's favorite [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=762.54s)]
*  caffeine and alcohol I actually have gone off caffeine for now two months [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=769.62s)]
*  since the start of the year and it's been amazing I miss it a little bit I [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=775.38s)]
*  miss I miss the the routine of it but were people who are drinking caffeine [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=781.02s)]
*  who are drinking you know two cups three cups four cups a day what's your [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=787.8199999999999s)]
*  advice for them if they're not getting a great night's sleep and that last bit [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=792.3s)]
*  is the key right because if it's not broken don't fix it I think sometimes we [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=796.38s)]
*  have a tendency to kind of over medicalize everything and over you know [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=800.54s)]
*  prescribe and you know introduce health tips when they're you know it's again [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=803.62s)]
*  not broken don't worry but essentially the key thing is as you're falling [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=808.9s)]
*  asleep is your mind racing that's you know one sign that you're just having [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=812.18s)]
*  too much caffeine and one thing to cut out if you are struggling with falling [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=816.5s)]
*  asleep and if you have too much caffeine though your sleep quality can take a hit [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=820.8199999999999s)]
*  so just be mindful and this is where just keeping a little diary about what [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=825.3s)]
*  you do over the course of the day can be really helpful and powerful from the [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=830.3399999999999s)]
*  standpoint of behavior change just being mindful with it three or four cups that [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=834.18s)]
*  I had and maybe thinking about pulling down to two or you know maybe three at [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=838.26s)]
*  the outset but caffeine is the most widely consumed drug in the world and [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=841.98s)]
*  it does have a half-life and so it stays in your system from anywhere between [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=845.86s)]
*  five to nine hours and there are genetic differences in how we metabolize [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=849.9s)]
*  caffeine so some people are lucky and able to metabolize it quickly and able [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=854.4599999999999s)]
*  to go you know to go to sleep shortly thereafter but keep in mind how much and [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=858.9s)]
*  importantly when you're drinking so many people will say oh you know I have a [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=863.8199999999999s)]
*  venti from Starbucks in the morning at 7 a.m. and I chug it and then I have one [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=867.4599999999999s)]
*  last coffee after lunch and then I'm doing them you know the math and that's [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=871.5s)]
*  a lot of caffeine so be mindful of how much you can and you can find out if [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=874.86s)]
*  you're a slower fast metabolizer from your genetics whether your liver is [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=879.78s)]
*  processing it rapidly or not but I think you know when you had your last cup of [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=883.74s)]
*  coffee is really the single most important metric here Tom you want to [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=888.4599999999999s)]
*  anything there absolutely I mean look I think from personal experience I spent [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=893.3s)]
*  most of my career waking up to you know a couple of jolts of coffee and then [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=897.9s)]
*  maybe having a drink at night to put myself to bed and having changed that [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=902.02s)]
*  behavior completely it's been transformative for me it's like it's [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=905.98s)]
*  like coming out of a black-and-white movie into the technicolor world what by [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=909.62s)]
*  by stopping caffeine I've learned that my body wakes up and does fine in the [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=913.9s)]
*  morning I don't need the jolt of caffeine now that to be clear I do use it [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=918.9s)]
*  on occasion because it does focus the mind and give you you know kind of a [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=923.22s)]
*  burst of like focused energy but I try and keep it before noon and I try and [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=926.5s)]
*  limit the consumption and maybe we'll get to alcohol in a second but like the [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=930.94s)]
*  other thing is that alcohol which I think many people view is sort of the [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=934.98s)]
*  the antidote you know what you would take after you were you know your minds [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=938.1s)]
*  racing you're heading off to bed you take a glass of wine to kind of take the [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=942.1s)]
*  edge off thing is is that that is a poison for your body and it ruins the [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=945.94s)]
*  quality of sleep yes let's jump into that because that is amazing you know [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=949.54s)]
*  people historically I think this is sort of social norms and you know we see in [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=952.7s)]
*  the movies that you know I'm gonna have a nightcap that glass of wine or scotch [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=957.98s)]
*  whatever to help me get to sleep and it does it does if you have an aura ring [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=963.72s)]
*  which I do I can tell you know it decimates my deep sleep you know what's [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=969.12s)]
*  the what's the science here because you think of it as a sedative but it does [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=976.12s)]
*  just the opposite for you totally and not my college students I feel like push [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=982.2s)]
*  back on this you're like you're wrong dr. Robbins alcohol is great I'll go right [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=985.82s)]
*  to sleep and it will put you to sleep because it has some sedative properties [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=989.96s)]
*  so it can maybe help you fall asleep but as you you mentioned from your [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=994.4399999999999s)]
*  experience you're exactly right Peter it starts to destroy the quality of our [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=998.48s)]
*  sleep it virtually starts to pull us out of the deeper stages as our body tries [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1002.48s)]
*  to enter them so you might notice on your aura ring you have more awakenings [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1006.56s)]
*  you have more fragmented sleep lower kind of readiness scores and that's all [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1010.08s)]
*  and there's kind of a stepwise function with alcohol's implications for our [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1016.08s)]
*  sleep so the one dose one glass wine beer could maybe give you about a 10% [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1021.44s)]
*  hit on your overall sleep quality according to the literature but then a [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1027.24s)]
*  second glass gives you about a 25 or 28% hit and then kind of so on and so forth [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1031.08s)]
*  from there and your body mass does factor in a little bit here but the most [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1036.4s)]
*  powerful thing when you this is one of the best reasons to have a tracker is [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1041.2s)]
*  it kind of can help you do this end-of-one experiment where if you're [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1044.76s)]
*  willing to try if you find that your sleep is suffering and you're desperate [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1048.48s)]
*  for a coffee in the morning you're desperate for a glass of wine at night [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1051.8799999999999s)]
*  just consider yourself at this little end-of-one experiment what if I go off [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1054.56s)]
*  for two days and see how I feel just cold turkey no coffee no no alcohol and [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1059.32s)]
*  just notice how you feel during the day and then if you have a tracker the data [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1064.56s)]
*  that you're getting from that device and that behavior change is the most [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1069.04s)]
*  powerful because then you can really see how these things really have big [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1072.0s)]
*  implications for our sleep yeah absolutely it's like I do that for [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1076.92s)]

*  great night sleep and let's jump into that and I want to hit on a number of [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1320.5800000000002s)]
*  different things and you can tell me what I miss here but there's a circadian [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1325.1000000000001s)]
*  rhythm and I when I think about it probably what got me to a 97 last night [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1330.0600000000002s)]
*  what I'm so proud of right it's like the highest score I've ever gotten and it's [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1335.3400000000001s)]
*  just appropriate for her and the day of this podcast was I got to sleep at my [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1338.22s)]
*  perfect time I wore you know blue light blockers and I prepped a half an hour [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1344.7s)]
*  getting into sleep so let's talk about circadian rhythm about what time you go [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1350.98s)]
*  to sleep what time you wake up for a second and then I want to talk about the [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1356.98s)]
*  different elements of it I want I want to give people the the tips and tricks [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1362.1000000000001s)]
*  to get a great night sleep Rebecca you want to talk about the circadian side of [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1365.9s)]
*  sure so and our sleep is governed by two primary forces the first we refer to in [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1371.1799999999998s)]
*  the field is the homeostatic drive for sleep and it's just your overall feeling [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1376.4599999999998s)]
*  of sleepiness so that simply starts to increase with each additional hour [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1380.4199999999998s)]
*  you've been awake but that's not all of the equation we can all attest to this [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1384.3799999999999s)]
*  if you ever recall a time where you're like I'm gonna get on track and go to [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1388.2199999999998s)]
*  bed three hours early you know I'm gonna go to bed early and people put you know [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1391.7399999999998s)]
*  all this is a good thing but wrong because the second force that governs [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1394.3799999999999s)]
*  our sleep is something called a circadian rhythm it's Latin for about a [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1398.22s)]
*  day circa dies and it refers to processes in the brain and in the body [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1401.7s)]
*  that operate in approximate 24-hour fashion we've all adjusted our rhythms [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1406.18s)]
*  over thousands of years up to the pattern of light and darkness on earth [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1410.98s)]
*  which is about 24 hours so what's so fascinating is if we put individual cells [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1414.7800000000002s)]
*  and petri dishes they actually demonstrate the circadian fashion so [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1419.5800000000002s)]
*  there are these tiny clocks that govern when things should be firing over the [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1423.74s)]
*  course of the day which makes so much sense so we're not you know going at a [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1428.42s)]
*  million miles an hour the entire day we have a period of time as human beings [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1431.9s)]
*  where we can rest and then other cells and organs in the body can do the same [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1435.6200000000001s)]
*  so this circadian system is housed in the brain in a tiny region called the [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1440.42s)]
*  suprachiasmatic nucleus my favorite if you want to impress someone at a cocktail [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1445.5s)]
*  party say that ten times fast right super charismatic nucleus and it refers [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1449.7s)]
*  to this tiny little region of the brain that sits above the optic chiasm and so [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1454.5800000000002s)]
*  light comes in from your environment enters the brain through the eyeball [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1459.1000000000001s)]
*  triggers the on switch to the circadian rhythm telling the brain to stop the [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1462.1200000000001s)]
*  floodgates of melatonin and that it's time to become alert and awake and then [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1467.1000000000001s)]
*  sunsets in our environment and it's that setting of the Sun that we perceive [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1471.14s)]
*  through our eyeballs and then triggers the secretion of melatonin it's not [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1475.22s)]
*  instant there's actually something fascinating that happens right after [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1479.3799999999999s)]
*  sunset we actually have the strongest drive for wakefulness think about that [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1483.82s)]
*  right after sunset which is kind of counterintuitive when you think about it [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1488.34s)]
*  but we think it played this evolutionary role of hunters and gatherers running [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1492.4199999999998s)]
*  out to you know forage for the night at before they go in to hibernate so then [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1496.1399999999999s)]
*  we about 90 years or a little bit longer minutes thereafter we start to become [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1500.4599999999998s)]
*  sleepy and if we weren't in an environment with fluorescent light bulbs [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1505.26s)]
*  we would have no light to keep us awake and so we'd fall asleep and then [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1508.78s)]
*  sunlight again in the morning would trigger the on phase of that circadian [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1512.14s)]
*  rhythm so sleep is a circadian rhythm our heart rate operates on a circadian [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1515.82s)]
*  rhythm our body temperature ebbs and flows also and again virtually every [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1520.22s)]
*  part of the body so what that means for our sleep is that the timing of our [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1524.6200000000001s)]
*  sleep is incredibly important we recently went through the time the [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1529.02s)]
*  painful time change of the hour lost during daylight saving time and we can [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1532.94s)]
*  all probably attest to that one hour making a huge difference but there were [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1538.02s)]
*  a couple things going on in the spring spring forward transition the vast [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1542.5s)]
*  majority of Americans don't prepare for that so they just generally take that [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1546.78s)]
*  our hit from their sleep duration and Americans are getting enough sleep so [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1549.86s)]
*  that translates into a very sleepy country more heart attacks more car [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1553.98s)]
*  accidents more something we called this is my another favorite science term [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1557.82s)]
*  called cyber loafing employees show up at the office but slack off by surfing [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1561.82s)]
*  the web so all these bad things happen but in part is that loss of an hour and [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1566.22s)]
*  we're shifting our clocks also and so that one hour believe it or not makes a [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1572.02s)]
*  big difference and that has implications for sleeping in on the weekends so we [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1576.78s)]
*  want to try to resist that as best as possible and really be laser focused on [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1581.78s)]
*  your target fall asleep time and your target wake up time and that will allow [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1586.38s)]
*  your circadian rhythm to know when it's supposed to be tired and when it's [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1591.34s)]
*  supposed to be alert and then organize itself and then within those windows [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1594.5s)]
*  yeah mine I interesting I find tuned it when I was in medical school and I was [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1598.02s)]
*  at HMS where you are faculty at Harvard med school I remember I was 2 a.m. was [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1602.5s)]
*  like when I was I would hit my stride between like 10 p.m. and 1 a.m. and and [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1611.3400000000001s)]
*  until morning rounds that shifted everything in but today I need to be in [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1618.22s)]
*  bed by 930 I need to be in bed by 930 to get my score and to and then I'll wake [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1621.82s)]
*  up at about 6 a.m. on my on my own typically and it's interesting as your [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1628.26s)]
*  that changes throughout life doesn't it it does so Peter your your schedule in [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1634.26s)]
*  medical school sounds a lot like my college students and medical students [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1639.34s)]
*  that I mentor there traditionally owls true owls we were not sure why this [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1642.58s)]
*  happens this is research at Stanford but we for some reason around puberty [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1647.46s)]
*  transition collectively by and large to being more evening like so our [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1652.78s)]
*  youngsters after puberty until the early 20s is this change really persists [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1657.82s)]
*  there's a strong preference for eveningness or you know being productive [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1662.1000000000001s)]
*  in the evening hours coming alive in the evening hours and I heard that was [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1666.26s)]
*  speaking after that you can turn that was basic basically to get away from [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1670.18s)]
*  your parents to go find your mate and reproduce I mean I can imagine that [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1674.5s)]
*  right yeah it's all about good hypothesis Peter Tom how about you when [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1679.14s)]
*  do you wake up and go to sleep yeah you know it's funny I'm a sort of 10 p.m. to [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1685.18s)]
*  5 5 a.m. or 6 6 you know between 5 and 6 and I've actually been experimenting [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1690.94s)]
*  with a blood glucose monitor and the thing that I learned it was just [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1695.86s)]
*  fascinating from that was that the beginning of my you know circadian rhythm [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1699.98s)]
*  in the morning is a cortisol spike they call it the dawn spike and anybody who's [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1703.94s)]
*  worn a glucose monitor might know this but it's basically your body when you're [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1708.38s)]
*  waking up you know your temperature starts to elevate a little bit coming [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1713.22s)]
*  out of sleep you get this little blast of cortisol which is there to sort of [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1716.1000000000001s)]
*  wake up your wake up your body and it starts the production of glucose being [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1719.7s)]
*  released into the blood which gives you energy in the morning and the thing is [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1724.14s)]
*  that if you if you time that right that little spike of cortisol and that [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1727.38s)]
*  glucose spike is something that kind of launches you into your day it's actually [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1731.3s)]
*  I think in many ways what's responsible for me feeling like I don't need to [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1735.22s)]
*  drink coffee in the morning because I've got that little jolt of energy coming in [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1737.9s)]
*  from from waking up so the circadian rhythm it defines so much on the other [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1742.02s)]
*  side the nightly going to bedside for me the factor that mattered the most was [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1746.02s)]
*  eating late because if I eat late and particularly since I have a fondness for [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1750.38s)]
*  for sugary desserts you know it would have an impact on my sleep if I wasn't [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1755.66s)]
*  careful so I have now made a real habit of making sure that I give a nice window [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1759.62s)]
*  before bedtime of not eating and I try and avoid the sugary sugary desserts at [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1763.4599999999998s)]
*  night and it's made a huge difference again in the quality not necessarily [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1767.34s)]
*  just the quantity but the quality of my sleep yeah let's let's talk about those [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1770.6599999999999s)]
*  specific getting ready for bed the do's and the don'ts there and one of them is [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1774.2199999999998s)]
*  eating for sure you know those of you who've been my podcast we talked about [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1780.06s)]
*  intermittent fasting and it's basically can you eat dinner at 6 630 and then [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1785.18s)]
*  fast till the next day and get a good 12 to 16 hours of fast time that helps the [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1792.14s)]
*  body in different ways but one of the other ways it helps you is to get a [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1797.5800000000002s)]
*  good night's sleep if you are snacking and people who take Ambien for example [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1800.18s)]
*  one of the things that it does is it lowers your inhibition to eating and a [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1805.78s)]
*  lot of people are snacking late at night when they're on Ambien which has a lot [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1809.86s)]
*  of detrimental effects in terms of obesity and others but the impact of [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1815.82s)]
*  eating late on your quality of your sleep let's talk about that a second and [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1821.3s)]
*  the two things that kind of you know what you're eating and and when also but [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1826.02s)]
*  one of the things that that I love to talk about in this on this topic is the [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1832.26s)]
*  old adage from nutrition of a breakfast of Kings a lunch of princes a dinner of [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1836.94s)]
*  poppers has actually been tested from the standpoint of our sleep and that [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1842.6200000000001s)]
*  also is better than it much better to structure your nutritional intake a [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1846.3s)]
*  little bit heavier in the morning heavier in the afternoon and then later [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1850.3s)]
*  in dinner I think that's kind of a good across-the-board kind of you know guide [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1853.8600000000001s)]
*  post to keep in mind for all of us but then the intermittent fasting literature [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1857.46s)]
*  is amazing this is all such and panda's work at the Salk Institute and his work [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1860.6200000000001s)]
*  is just so compelling it shows that we can move people from being pre-diabetic [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1865.26s)]
*  this you know health trajectory in the direction of type 2 diabetes and pull [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1868.94s)]
*  them out of that nosedive really but with these small changes that are you [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1873.46s)]
*  know also I think really powerful because behavior can become a little bit [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1877.46s)]
*  mindless at night we've been processing information all day we've been doing [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1880.8600000000001s)]
*  we've been responding and then your day suddenly comes to a halt and then maybe [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1884.5s)]
*  you want to spend some time with your spouse and then you're watching a [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1888.38s)]
*  Netflix episode and then maybe one more and so our behavior can kind of start to [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1890.5s)]
*  spiral and then maybe enjoying some popcorn with that movie but I think one [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1894.98s)]
*  of the single things about intermittent fasting that the science is so cool but [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1898.74s)]
*  it's also just helpful to have guardrails around behavior you know try to [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1902.18s)]
*  be done eating by a certain time and at least give yourself an hour and a half [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1906.02s)]
*  two hours and then any more would be better of a buffer between the last time [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1910.26s)]
*  you finish eating and your bedtime but two three hours would just be would be [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1915.38s)]
*  terrific going to ritual of getting ready for bed and and Tom I'm curious [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1919.58s)]
*  your thoughts here my ritual just to share it and then we can comment off of [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1926.78s)]
*  that is I try and give myself a half-hour wind down where I'm off [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1931.82s)]
*  computer I'm not watching TV I'm wearing my blue light blocking glasses and I'm [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1937.1s)]
*  typically actually using audible to listen to a book like a bedtime story [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1945.1399999999999s)]
*  and then I'll put on my my eyeshades I love my Manta mask and I use a mouthguard [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1951.02s)]
*  we'll talk about that in a minute for sort of like not you know getting good [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1958.9399999999998s)]
*  good airway and that is a ritual that gets me off to a great night's sleep and [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1963.3799999999999s)]
*  then I'm out talk about rituals and what that sort of approach to landing so to [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1971.3400000000001s)]
*  speak as I'm a pilot I think about getting ready to get your airplane [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1978.5s)]
*  prepped and get down onto the runway asleep Tom yeah I mean obviously not [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1981.7s)]
*  staring at a computer screen is so key you know the kind of light that comes [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1987.38s)]
*  off of a you know a LED display is blue light and blue light is a signal to your [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1992.14s)]
*  body that it's not time for bed and that you shouldn't have that surge of [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=1998.54s)]
*  melatonin which is the starting gate so absolutely that's probably you know [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2001.6599999999999s)]
*  first and foremost the second one I think and Dr. Robbins can confirm this [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2006.82s)]
*  but your body temperature actually you know when you go to sleep your body [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2011.74s)]
*  temperature declines a little bit about a degree and so setting that up and [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2015.86s)]
*  getting your body into that cooling cycle is really important and you can [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2019.86s)]
*  see that there are products that actually help cool your bed or taking a [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2023.1399999999999s)]
*  hot shower at night which actually forces your internal thermostat to [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2026.42s)]
*  adjust lower these are all factors that kind of ready yourself and ready your [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2029.3000000000002s)]
*  body for deep sleep in particular there are other things of course as you said [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2033.22s)]
*  like something that's calming or soothing and takes your mind off of the [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2037.98s)]
*  cares of the day whether that's a reading a book or listening to a soothing [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2041.02s)]
*  podcast or a sleep story those are all demonstrated obviously dark you know [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2046.78s)]
*  the other one I think is really interesting is just that the nature of [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2053.34s)]
*  how you use your bed and using your bed not for other things besides sleep makes [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2057.5s)]
*  it a place where it trains your brain to expect that when you go to bed that this [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2061.86s)]
*  is the time for sleep you start to build this kind of association all of those [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2065.1000000000004s)]
*  factors I think come together I think the key is everyone's different and so [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2068.7400000000002s)]
*  you have to kind of experiment with each factor to see which one is is maybe most [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2073.26s)]
*  powerful or most impactful for you as you're optimizing your sleep over the [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2076.6600000000003s)]
*  I've experimented with many intermittent fasting programs the truth is I've given [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2080.3s)]
*  up on intermittent fasting as I've seen no real benefit when it comes to [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2085.7400000000002s)]
*  longevity but this changed when I discovered something called Prolon's [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2089.7000000000003s)]
*  five-day fasting nutrition program it harnesses the process of autophagy this [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2093.6200000000003s)]

*  hit on something you said and then I'll turn to Dr. Robbins here I have to have [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2136.62s)]
*  my room set at 64 degrees or 63 degrees Fahrenheit right and I have also have a [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2140.54s)]
*  you know an eight sleep a chilling mattress if you would that brings the [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2146.22s)]
*  temperature down and a lot of times if I would ever wake up it's because I'm too [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2151.2599999999998s)]
*  hot and I haven't turned the mattress on or I haven't set the proper environmental [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2155.62s)]
*  controls but cold is my dear dear friend for getting a great night's sleep Dr. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2160.42s)]
*  Robbins what are your thoughts on all these these sort of the prep mechanisms [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2166.78s)]
*  the hygiene of sleep here that's all right on temperature of the bedroom is a [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2170.5s)]
*  key consideration and there's some individual preference and difference [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2175.42s)]
*  within the range but generally you're really right on target what we generally [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2178.86s)]
*  recommend is somewhere between 65 and 68 that keeps you in what's called a [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2185.2200000000003s)]
*  thermal neutral zone because in certain stages of sleep we're not able to [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2189.1s)]
*  thermally regulate our body shiver if we're cold sweat if we're hot and so we [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2192.3399999999997s)]
*  want to keep you in a zone where you're not going to be susceptible to those [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2196.86s)]
*  swings and if that in your environment where you live if that does you know the [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2199.1s)]
*  colder mattress pad or if you're able to turn your thermostat down in the warmer [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2203.46s)]
*  months some data came out last summer that looked at sleep in the UK where [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2207.06s)]
*  air conditioning isn't as common as the US and there were a couple heatwaves and [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2212.14s)]
*  sleep quality was just abysmal across the country so temperature really really [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2216.74s)]
*  matters the other dictates of a great a great room for sleep are quiet and cool [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2222.4599999999996s)]

*  you're you're wearing an eye mask if you have any light that comes in at your [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2233.54s)]
*  doorway in the morning or through your curtains then an eye mask is you know a [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2237.3399999999997s)]
*  great way to go to make sure that you're doing your best to create a really dark [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2240.7s)]
*  and kind of cave like environment you really want to walk into your bedroom [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2244.3399999999997s)]
*  and be able to turn everything off and just literally have a hard time getting [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2247.3399999999997s)]
*  around because it's so dark because that can again helps trigger the secretion of [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2251.94s)]
*  melatonin and I think we all are maybe a little guilty of spending in other areas [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2255.7s)]
*  of our life than our bedroom I one of my kind of jokes I love asking people where [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2261.98s)]
*  that when they got their mattress and where because very few people can [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2267.5s)]
*  actually articulate those things are like oh you know uncle Jim gave it to me [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2270.3s)]
*  ten years ago and it's over so much more likely to go but you know buy a pair of [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2274.1000000000004s)]
*  shoes then invest in our our you know sleep environment and I think that's [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2277.9s)]
*  starting to change we're kind of collectively waking up is a society to [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2281.98s)]
*  the importance of sleep so I think that it's a really it's just an exciting time [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2286.02s)]
*  and sleep tech and and sleep science for that reason invest in your sleep [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2289.86s)]
*  critical there's so many tools and there's so much education available now [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2294.1800000000003s)]
*  right that people can people can draw on the thing is is again everyone's a [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2299.9s)]
*  little bit different and some people's lives don't actually lend themselves to [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2303.38s)]
*  you know having a really really great sleep routine you maybe you've got young [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2306.26s)]
*  kids or maybe you have a demanding job whatever it is but there are definitely [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2309.26s)]
*  things that can work so for example if you do have to stare at screens as you [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2313.02s)]
*  said Peter having blue light blockers you know which are glasses that will you [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2316.3s)]
*  know keep the blue light from getting to your you know optic nerve and then [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2320.6600000000003s)]
*  affecting the production of melatonin like that is actually really you know [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2323.7000000000003s)]
*  that's a great solution and I will admit that sometimes I do check my phone [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2327.3s)]
*  after nine you know just for a last minute look at the day and I when I do [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2331.1800000000003s)]
*  that I'll wear blue light blockers and and you know my sleep scores and the [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2336.54s)]
*  experiments that I run to sort of see what the impact is illustrate that those [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2339.9s)]
*  kinds of things work so it I think the key I think is that there's lots of [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2343.42s)]
*  tools available and you need to find what works for you and having a tool [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2346.5s)]
*  that allows you to measure and track your outcomes if you can't measure it [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2349.6200000000003s)]
*  can't manage it exactly this is not everyone's the same these are all great [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2354.7s)]
*  pieces of advice but the thing is you've got to find what works for you and your [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2358.06s)]
*  life and where you are in your in your you know in your existence because you [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2361.3399999999997s)]
*  know folks like you know who have young kids it's hard for them to get good [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2365.3799999999997s)]
*  sleep that's just the nature of the business yeah I have 11 year olds now and [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2368.8999999999996s)]

*  you should always be trying to do your best [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2376.5s)]

*  things that soothe you and I love the question you know what is the most [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2395.9s)]
*  relaxing thing to you is that the idea of being at a spa and if that's the case [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2399.58s)]
*  maybe get some really nice hand creams or an aroma therapy a smell that you [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2403.62s)]
*  love and make sure that you integrate that into your routine and so whether [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2408.3399999999997s)]

*  your teeth and then you turn off your iPhone these these steps they sound [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2416.94s)]
*  trivial but they're actually really important because then you start [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2420.74s)]
*  classical conditioning from psychology you start to train your brain to [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2423.46s)]
*  understand okay it's a warm shower a couple pages in a book I turn off my [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2426.94s)]
*  phone and then I I meditate for five minutes or I do with a four seven eight [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2431.7799999999997s)]
*  breath technique or alternate nostril breathing or another one of my favorites [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2436.22s)]
*  is progressive muscle relaxation a really easy one to do in bed crawl into [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2440.34s)]
*  the sheets turn off your phone and then clench and release different muscle [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2445.2200000000003s)]
*  groups and as you're inhaling kind of imagine a pit like a part of tension or [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2449.5s)]
*  you know a place where there's tension and then as you're exhaling you let [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2453.38s)]
*  that go from your body and if you just do that and you know work the way up at [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2456.34s)]
*  the body you might you know find yourself sleepy by the end so whatever [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2460.7400000000002s)]
*  it is think of those things as your toolkit and I've used that word because [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2464.3s)]
*  that toolkit gets you to fall asleep but then that toolkit is also there for you [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2468.06s)]
*  if you're having it middle of the night insomnia so if you're up for whatever [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2473.14s)]
*  reason you had to use the bathroom or you're stressed then go back to that [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2476.82s)]
*  toolkit that playbook that gets you to sleep next on my list let's talk about [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2479.82s)]
*  that it's it's 3 a.m. your eyes pop open and you you know you're hoping it's 6 a.m. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2483.98s)]
*  in the morning but it's not it's 3 a.m. in the morning and you know you can't go [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2490.02s)]
*  just get up right now and so the question is what do you do so you were [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2493.76s)]
*  saying go to that toolkit I've heard people say if you really in insomnia get [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2499.36s)]
*  out of bed and go and and change your environment for a few minutes and just [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2505.28s)]
*  don't lie there and then go back to bed and try and reinitiate any advice on for [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2511.76s)]
*  people who have that bout of insomnia the first thing is to notice that this [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2517.48s)]
*  is part of the fabric of the human condition awakenings are actually not [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2522.92s)]
*  something necessarily to worry about our ancestors were sleeping in two periods [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2526.2400000000002s)]
*  they were up for you know a stretch of time in the middle of the night so [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2529.88s)]
*  number one think about it just notice how you're talking to yourself if you [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2533.2000000000003s)]
*  wake up and are you kicking yourself like oh again and as soon as you do try [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2537.36s)]
*  to change that narrative and just tell yourself no big deal I'm up I'm gonna [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2542.6s)]
*  think about doing whatever maybe got you up if it's using the bathroom go do that [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2547.2400000000002s)]
*  and the self-talk is really important just I'm up no big deal I'm gonna go [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2551.68s)]
*  back to bed and then crawl back in the covers and give it a shot and go back to [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2555.92s)]
*  that playbook for seven eight breath technique think about happy thoughts [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2560.64s)]
*  maybe read a couple pages in a book and then try again turn on you know slip into [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2564.2s)]
*  and close close your eyes and then if that little voice comes on again it's [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2568.8s)]
*  like not again that's when you get out of bed as soon as that little voice [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2572.2s)]
*  comes on and go to your floor do a meditation technique do some gentle [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2576.36s)]
*  yoga poses maybe read a couple pages with a light slow and then try it again [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2580.2s)]
*  come back when you're tired and if you're really experiencing insomnia that [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2585.3599999999997s)]
*  that dictate of really being diligent about this leaving bed as soon as you [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2589.8399999999997s)]
*  toss and turn because there's really this kind of old wives tale that if you [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2594.48s)]
*  stay in bed any sleep will be better than no sleep or you know leaving the [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2597.48s)]
*  the bedroom and or kind of leaving bed is really key to kind of reset yourself [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2602.0s)]
*  and set yourself up actually for your best shot and getting back to sleep [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2607.44s)]
*  I'll mention something Tom I'll ask you if you have any other advice a lot of [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2610.4s)]
*  times will wake me up is my mind is racing I've just thought of something [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2614.96s)]
*  and what I typically have learned to do is go get out of bed go to my desk with [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2619.0s)]
*  the lights low or my my blue blocker lenses on and do a brain dump I'll write [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2627.08s)]
*  down everything I've been thinking about and the list of things I hope I remember [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2634.2799999999997s)]
*  in the morning and it will feel complete when I get it out of my head and then go [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2638.9199999999996s)]
*  back and try and reinitiate Tom any other advice on insomnia that I would [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2643.9199999999996s)]
*  totally echo what you just said Peter because I think that sort of waking up [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2649.52s)]
*  and your mind racing and you're starting to kind of process information maybe [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2654.2s)]
*  formulate some strategy like writing it down one it saves you the need to sort [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2657.72s)]
*  of store it in memory so you can kind of let it go and then two I think actually [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2662.64s)]
*  as you said you kind of say okay good that you know and I've kind of taken care [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2666.8799999999997s)]
*  of that I will say this I think breathing and counting are super [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2669.8799999999997s)]
*  underestimated in the toolkit because both of those things put your body you [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2675.2s)]
*  know your physiology into a restful state and if you can you know work deep [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2679.6s)]
*  nostril breathing you know long breaths whether it's box breathing or poor seven [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2684.1s)]
*  whatever approach works for you breathing is so powerful especially if [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2688.7999999999997s)]
*  you if you couple it with sometimes like a sleep story something that takes your [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2693.24s)]
*  mind off of that you know whatever your is causing your mind to race and so [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2696.8399999999997s)]
*  breathing distraction and having something that allows you to sort of you [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2700.68s)]
*  know export the information from your mind so you don't have to store it in [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2705.92s)]
*  memory I think those are those are all really good tactics and just the [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2709.16s)]
*  relaxation response just to add a colleague here wrote a book on this topic [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2712.8399999999997s)]
*  and it's not innate and so really thinking of our ability to relax is kind [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2717.52s)]
*  of a muscle that you need to build and whether it's a breathing technique or [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2722.04s)]
*  the progressive muscle or a prayer whatever gets you into that state it's [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2726.2s)]
*  something that though as human beings we really have to work at any mother of a [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2730.32s)]
*  new child you know screaming baby coming out of the womb can attest to this [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2733.52s)]
*  there's no natural reflex which is interesting when you think about right so [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2736.6s)]
*  it's something we have to kind of ever work for let me touch on two last [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2740.36s)]
*  subtopics and I want to turn to the to the sleep tech these days which is naps [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2743.84s)]
*  during the day and dealing with jet lag all right we're back in our travel [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2751.8s)]
*  schedules again Tom I saw you in in Saudi Arabia last October you know 12 [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2756.4s)]
*  hour time zone change the worst so do you think dr. Robbins naps are okay if so [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2762.04s)]
*  when how long and then any advice on dealing with jet lag or you just you [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2772.68s)]
*  know are you just stuck with an hour change per day so naps in many cases can [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2777.52s)]
*  let's start with naps naps can in many cases be a part of a healthy sleep [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2782.24s)]
*  routine if you're a healthy sleeper and you're you maybe feel a little bit [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2787.0s)]
*  groggy in the afternoon totally fine to go for what we call a power nap which is [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2790.16s)]
*  about 20 minutes it's gonna get you a little bit of rest you know not a lot [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2794.72s)]
*  but it's enough to kind of power you through and a much better solution than [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2798.3199999999997s)]
*  coffee I it always makes me laugh that people will literally do anything but [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2802.12s)]
*  the one evidence-based thing that pays off sleepiness which is sleep and [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2806.96s)]
*  everyone's like no what's the 10-hour energy drinker you know whatever [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2811.04s)]
*  sleep guys it's not rocket science and so can be a godsend a lot of companies [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2814.0s)]
*  are waking up to this putting nap pods and things like that and work sites so [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2819.0s)]
*  they can be a part of a healthy sleep routine the one so sorry my dog is [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2823.64s)]
*  snoring I'm so sorry so but okay so the one exception is anyone who's suffering [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2827.84s)]
*  from insomnia we want to build what we talked about earlier that homeostatic [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2841.4s)]
*  drive for sleep and give that person the best chance of hitting that peak in [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2845.32s)]
*  their homeostatic drive and then coupling that with their circadian [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2849.92s)]
*  rhythm and their target fall asleep time so that's the one exception but [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2852.8s)]
*  otherwise again you know indulge in it up if you're feeling a little bit groggy [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2856.72s)]
*  you know I know I just I'm about to have a chat with with Chris Paul [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2860.6s)]
*  basketball player and or ambassador and one of the things that he swears by is [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2864.72s)]
*  the afternoon nap especially for the night game you know you think about for [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2869.04s)]
*  someone who has to play a game at night they can't control their bedtime because [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2872.48s)]
*  who knows how long the game's gonna go and then you take a bus back to the hotel [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2875.0s)]
*  all these kinds of things the nap before the game in the afternoon is like it's a [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2878.7599999999998s)]
*  standard in high-performance athletes and and again it does go back to like it [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2884.28s)]
*  is your natural thing if you were tired the natural thing to do is to fall asleep [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2889.2000000000003s)]
*  I think the other thing to call out and we wouldn't really talk about this yet [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2892.5600000000004s)]
*  but it is about daytime activity one of the most important daytime activities [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2896.44s)]
*  that contributes to good sleep is exercise right just just keeping your [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2899.8s)]
*  body both moving and activated particularly not you know not close to [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2903.52s)]
*  bedtime but during the day it gives you that opportunity both the you know wear [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2907.92s)]
*  off the mental stress that you might have but also it does help prime your [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2911.88s)]
*  body for better sleep so when I've exercised at night that has done had a [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2915.36s)]
*  negative impact on my sleep so I do exercise first thing in the morning I'm [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2920.12s)]
*  like usually a 7 to 8 a.m. weight workout person is that true in general that [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2925.2400000000002s)]
*  exercising at night it has detrimental effects well the science is a little bit [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2930.12s)]
*  mixed on this I think we need more studies but it kind of depends on the [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2934.4s)]
*  population I think there's been some studies with endurance athletes that [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2937.8s)]
*  have shown no detriment there have been other populations but I think one of the [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2940.96s)]
*  key things is just noticing what works best for your body we talked a little [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2944.96s)]
*  bit about about circadian rhythms and we didn't get too too much too far a little [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2948.92s)]
*  bit into chronotypes which basically refer to your preference for being alert [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2953.04s)]
*  and productive a more a true morning person will tell me I want to get up [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2958.7200000000003s)]
*  Peter this sounds like you often type A individuals are this morning type you [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2962.2000000000003s)]
*  know morning workouts I'm up I'm you know ready to go and then you're winding [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2966.48s)]
*  down at night and then evening people will conversely tell me that they become [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2970.36s)]
*  alive at night and so evening people might do well to have an evening workout [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2974.0s)]
*  have a dinner and then wait two or three hours set themselves up you know shoot [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2978.44s)]
*  for a 1 a.m. bedtime but then their challenge is going to be keeping the [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2984.2000000000003s)]
*  morning light out of their bedroom so really investing in thick curtains so [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2987.92s)]
*  that they can sleep in their optimal window and not be disrupted let's talk [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2991.0s)]
*  about jet lag which destroys a lot of people and you know I'm not immune to it [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=2995.6400000000003s)]
*  typically it hits me on the second night and the third night any advice I mean [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3000.2799999999997s)]
*  the old adage is it takes you an hour to shift an hour I mean a day to shift an [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3006.0s)]
*  hour time zone is that still correct dr. Robbins I believe so and essentially [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3012.8799999999997s)]
*  this all refers to modern-day air travel of the amazing ability to wake up you [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3018.24s)]
*  know it's really rocket lag yeah but are of course our internal rhythms are [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3022.4399999999996s)]
*  lagging behind in our home in our home location so the key question for me with [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3027.0s)]
*  this is how long is your trip are you going to be there for two days then I'd [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3031.44s)]
*  say rip off the band-aid do you're going to be in survival mode it's not going to [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3035.84s)]
*  be pleasant but I'd say it's probably not worth adjusting to your new time [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3039.48s)]
*  zone and then having to readjust back because if you do want to adjust to the [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3042.52s)]
*  new destination the destination time zone in a perfect scenario you're [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3046.28s)]
*  really being thoughtful and preparing so using that you know one day per hour and [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3050.28s)]
*  then thinking okay if it's London from Boston I'm going to start preparing a [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3055.48s)]
*  week out and move my bedtime methodically in the direction one of the [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3058.96s)]
*  kind of the myths as people say oh I'm going to take an overnight flight I'm [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3063.6s)]
*  going to wake up in London I'm going to walk around you know best thing walk [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3066.68s)]
*  around in the morning but what that's actually doing if you think about it from [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3070.7400000000002s)]
*  a circadian rhythms standpoint I've landed in the middle of my biological [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3073.68s)]
*  night and so if I expose myself to light what I'm actually doing is [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3078.6s)]
*  extending my rhythm basically putting myself on California time and so think [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3084.2s)]
*  about where you're moving towards and then how you're shifting your internal [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3089.16s)]
*  rhythm and I'm telling you we'll get circadian scientists together and be [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3092.8799999999997s)]
*  like wait which direction again it's so confusing to think about this you know [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3095.96s)]
*  light and rhythms and time and the directions but you do use blue light to [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3099.64s)]
*  your advantage but if you're going from say New York to London the key time to [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3104.16s)]
*  expose yourself to light is actually in the afternoon so wear sunglasses in the [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3108.2799999999997s)]
*  morning and then try maybe get a small nap and then sunlight exposure and [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3112.92s)]
*  you're really going to be on kind of a modified schedule for the first you know [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3116.76s)]
*  night or two anyway and then hopefully adjusting thereafter you know this is [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3120.32s)]
*  the hardest problem of being kind of a global business traveler is that there [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3124.7200000000003s)]
*  really is no perfect solution honestly I do find that light exposure is really [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3128.04s)]
*  powerful for sort of you know sort of setting that trigger and if you're [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3134.56s)]
*  intentional about light exposure you can make a you can make a big difference in [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3137.2000000000003s)]
*  the feeling of jet lag you know you can give yourself that sort of feeling of [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3140.48s)]
*  wakefulness I've often used a product called time shifter which is basically a [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3144.28s)]
*  scheduled set of activities whether it's drinking coffee or going to bed later or [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3150.16s)]
*  light exposure to start to shift your time particularly for long trips that's [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3155.04s)]
*  actually what I use when I went to Saudi Arabia and it you know it did make a [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3159.2s)]
*  difference but it was not a perfect solution there is just some amount of [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3163.8s)]
*  shifting you're gonna have to go through with your body adjusting to a new time [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3168.4s)]
*  zone and a new rhythm everybody this is Peter a quick break from the episode [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3172.54s)]

*  an exquisite device because of the tech that's packed into it let's see if we [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3255.56s)]
*  can rattle off Tom one second what first of all the o'ring has become [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3261.36s)]
*  beautiful you beautified it and be nicely but what is inside we got we have [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3264.7599999999998s)]
*  we have Bluetooth transmitter to get to your phone we've got batteries in there [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3271.0s)]
*  and a bunch of sensors got infrared LEDs you've got red LEDs you've got green LEDs [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3275.0s)]
*  those LEDs are different for different kind of wavelengths of and also their [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3280.44s)]
*  resistance to noise so green LEDs are great for heart rate during the day red [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3285.04s)]

*  just from a tech standpoint it's a beautiful packaging and if you're [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3404.08s)]
*  watching this this podcast on on YouTube you know this the ring it looks like a [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3407.08s)]
*  wedding ring it's not so it used to be the earlier versions had a very large [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3411.72s)]
*  head on them that had the tech but the tech has become super micromaniturized [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3416.96s)]
*  and you have it in gold and silver and black and stealth and the whole slew of [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3421.52s)]
*  different different designs and I know a lot of people who actually use it as [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3427.36s)]
*  their wedding ring which is which is pretty cool and it just to again it's [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3430.96s)]
*  measuring those LEDs the red and the green and the blue LEDs are looking at [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3437.4s)]
*  pulse waveform in the little arteries on the underside of your finger is that [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3444.12s)]
*  correct that's right yeah and that's important by the way because I think [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3449.72s)]
*  many people think about you know the ring of course is being very small and [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3454.08s)]
*  very light it's four grams so it feels great it's actually a great tool to go [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3458.6s)]
*  to sleep with because it's the one thing you don't take off your body when you [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3461.4s)]
*  get into bed you know you're just it's just sort of goes with you but it is [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3464.56s)]
*  really important to understand that this this site on the body is a really [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3467.96s)]
*  excellent site for measurement and the reason for that is twofold one is it's [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3471.36s)]
*  on the leading edge of the pulse waveform so when your heart pulses and [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3476.7200000000003s)]
*  blood shoots down your arteries down your arm it goes straight through the [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3480.08s)]
*  pulmonary artery right underneath the sensors and there's you know a not very [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3483.28s)]
*  much flesh in between that pulse and your your sensors plus that flesh is very [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3487.2400000000002s)]
*  uniform you know you're talking about basically you know kind of very you know [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3492.7200000000003s)]
*  very little muscle and a little fat that's that's basically the tissue so the [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3497.6s)]
*  signal that comes back from this site on the human body when you shine light into [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3501.64s)]
*  it and what light is refracted back it's it's 50 to 100 times better and more [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3505.92s)]
*  accurate than what you might get on the outside of your wrist and why is that [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3510.56s)]
*  well sir first of all you're receiving the signal on the trailing edge of the [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3512.7599999999998s)]
*  pulse waveform you're getting capillary action as it's returning to your heart [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3516.68s)]
*  secondarily the tissue here is not uniform you've got bone you've got thin [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3520.6s)]
*  you've got tissue you've got hair your skin may be darkened by by light and [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3525.04s)]
*  melanin this is a famous court case right now Apple's being accused that [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3529.52s)]
*  that their measurement for people of color is actually not as accurate simply [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3534.6400000000003s)]
*  because the light that's absorbed into the skin based on different profiles of [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3538.2000000000003s)]
*  melanin actually changes the the readings that the device gives back so [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3542.76s)]
*  all of these things add up to a really great site for measurement and you think [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3547.4s)]
*  about it when you go to a doctor they put the pulse box monitor on the tip of [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3551.56s)]
*  your finger and shine a light into it that's where they put it they don't put [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3555.64s)]
*  it on the outside of your wrist so that accuracy is really key and that [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3558.2s)]
*  translates into accuracy around sleep as well because the way we interpret sleep [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3561.08s)]
*  as we're looking for these changes and things like your temperature you have [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3564.2799999999997s)]
*  accelerometers and gyros on the on the device so we're looking for motion we're [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3568.04s)]
*  looking for you know changes in your heart rate and respiration and your HRV [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3572.2799999999997s)]
*  which turns out to be a really interesting predictor of moving between [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3576.32s)]
*  between different stages of sleep so the accuracy is really critical because it [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3580.76s)]
*  means that really that the software and the sensors get to know you personally [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3585.7200000000003s)]
*  and rather than sort of giving you some average it's really personalized to your [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3590.56s)]
*  experience and your physiology now for me this is about when people say what [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3594.88s)]
*  does your o-ring do for you it's about gamifying my sleep right I know when I [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3599.56s)]
*  go to sleep at night I'm shooting just for fun because that's who I am I'm [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3605.92s)]
*  shooting for my best night sleep and I know if I get to sleep at 10 versus 930 [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3611.12s)]
*  or if I have that glass of wine in the back of my brain it's going it's gonna [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3616.1600000000003s)]
*  impact your sleep and that becomes a trained behavior for me and it it works [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3620.52s)]
*  I mean if you if you can't measure it you can't improve it we've said that we [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3628.92s)]
*  said that before and it's it's true and you know I guess does it can anybody get [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3632.44s)]
*  to a hundred ever seen a hundred as a score on this thing it does happen yeah [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3639.92s)]
*  it does happen it's it's very rare and we you know we we we think it's pretty [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3644.56s)]
*  pretty amazing that people can do that but there's you know a slew of factors [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3650.12s)]
*  that if you really drive you can get there it's not necessary you know just [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3653.4s)]
*  making incremental improvements in your sleep will yield major improvements in [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3657.92s)]
*  quality of your life and as you point out your your mindset your mental health [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3662.12s)]
*  is tied to it but also your longevity I go back and forth on the gamification [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3665.8399999999997s)]
*  and actually philosophically at the company I think we're mostly about [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3671.72s)]
*  giving your body a voice and allowing you to really you know understand that [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3675.2s)]
*  voice and how it changes from its baseline that is the key it's about [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3679.6s)]
*  saying you know I'll give you an example one of one of my colleagues has a body [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3683.3199999999997s)]
*  temperature that's actually about a degree below 98.6 and so when he goes to [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3687.3199999999997s)]
*  the doctor and he has a temperature reading that says 98.6 you know what he's [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3691.56s)]
*  got he's got a fever and that's because he is different from everybody else and [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3694.48s)]
*  the thing is like giving your physiology that kind of baseline so you can [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3698.2s)]
*  understand the deviations from it that's the key because as you change your [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3702.48s)]
*  behaviors you can see the deviations and understand how you can improve or how [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3705.7599999999998s)]
*  that affects your physiology so sleep would be one example heart health would [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3709.96s)]
*  be another fitness would be another all these things are measured from your [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3714.12s)]
*  baseline because you know what for some people ten thousand steps is great for [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3717.24s)]
*  other people two thousand steps is way too much so it is important to think [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3720.72s)]
*  about it as a personalized experience for you. Which is really the future to [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3724.64s)]
*  think about just how personalized the advice because when we give people these [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3727.9199999999996s)]
*  you know take to almost bring it back to sleep duration if we give people these [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3731.2799999999997s)]
*  you know ranges or a number like eight hours go for that and then that's hard [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3734.9599999999996s)]
*  if someone's you know that's not their target number and then they feel [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3740.8799999999997s)]
*  uncomfortable and then can spiral kind of into some sleep difficulties so the [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3743.8399999999997s)]
*  personalization is really exciting. It happens all the time I mean people are [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3748.8s)]
*  always HRV is a metric that in some sense it's not as well understood or [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3752.48s)]
*  well known I think by the common public you know heart rate variability it's [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3756.96s)]
*  maybe where heart rate resting heart rate was in the 90s you know people [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3760.1600000000003s)]
*  didn't really know if it what was what was good or what was bad or you know [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3764.1200000000003s)]
*  what zone we've all become I think really attuned to that because largely I [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3767.1200000000003s)]
*  think fitness wearables have educated people HRV is one that's great for [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3771.28s)]
*  recovery it measures sort of the degree of change between heartbeats and that [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3775.0s)]
*  degree of change between heartbeats is a good indicator almost of the tension [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3779.48s)]
*  between your nervous systems your parasympathetic and your sympathetic [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3782.88s)]
*  nervous system so HRV is one of these metrics that as you get educated about [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3786.12s)]
*  it you learn how important it is and you start to see how sensitive it is a bad [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3789.4s)]
*  night's sleep a glass of wine a big workout two days ago like you'll see [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3793.64s)]
*  that in your heart rate variability and it becomes something that you start to [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3799.28s)]
*  really change your behavior around as you as you learn it I think it's so [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3802.0s)]
*  important to recognize though because we get this question all the time what's a [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3805.72s)]
*  good heart rate variability and the answer is there isn't one it's what's [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3808.68s)]
*  good for you and by the way it does change over your life and men and women [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3812.4s)]
*  have different ranges but it's not there's not one answer it's a set of [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3815.96s)]
*  guidelines and frankly it's about your physiology and the voice of your body [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3820.48s)]
*  talking to you you just need to know how to listen to it and what to do about it [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3824.6s)]
*  amazing well dr. Rebecca Robbins and CEO of our ring Tom hell thank you for this [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3828.0s)]
*  hour I hope for those of you listening realize sleep is a critical superpower [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXe1OKDfFZs&t=3835.92s)]
