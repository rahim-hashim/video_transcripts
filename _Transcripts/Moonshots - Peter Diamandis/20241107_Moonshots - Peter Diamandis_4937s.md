# What the Election Results Mean for Emerging Tech w/ Salim Ismail | EP #128
**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [November 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ)
*  We've got a Republican administration coming in. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=0.0s)]
*  What should be their policy on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3.48s)]
*  I think there's incredible potential here to operate now, create a global store of value. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=7.66s)]
*  How that juxtaposes with the fiat systems is going to be the big question. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=12.56s)]
*  There is an AI arms race going on. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=16.2s)]
*  It's not even between governments, it's between companies. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=18.76s)]
*  Is AI able to be regulated? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=22.68s)]
*  Should it be regulated? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=25.84s)]
*  I don't see any mechanism at all that you can regulate AI. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=26.96s)]
*  The horses left the barn. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=31.720000000000002s)]
*  How long before our democratic experiment here gets revamped for a world of AI sensors, networks? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=33.800000000000004s)]
*  Democracy is the worst form of government except for everything else. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=42.56s)]
*  We've been running democracies at a nation-state level for the last few hundred years. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=45.52s)]
*  The future of the world is not nation-states, it's city-states. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=49.64s)]
*  Hey everybody, Peter Diamandis here. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=56.96s)]
*  Welcome to WTF, Just Happening Technology. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=58.68s)]
*  I'm here with my dear brother and technology aficionado, Salim Ismail, the head of exponential organizations. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  Salim, good to see you, pal. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=69.84s)]
*  Likewise, big day. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=71.8s)]
*  Big day, yeah. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  We're recording this on November the 6th. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=74.52000000000001s)]
*  The Trump White House is imminent. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  The impact is going to be profound across all areas of technology. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=80.4s)]
*  I think we should talk about that, right? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  We see Tesla up 15%, Bitcoin is up at all-time highs at $6,000 up to $75,000, $76,000. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  Significant moves forecasted by a pro-tech, pro-deregulation White House that's coming. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  I first want to say, listen, when I tell people any questions for me other than sports or [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=107.04s)]
*  politics, I am a libertarian capitalist is how I would sort of describe myself. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=113.24s)]
*  How about you? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=119.24s)]
*  Yes, I'm a libertarian capitalist with some level of a social floor, minimum UBI framing [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=120.24s)]
*  type stuff. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=128.0s)]
*  So very close to you. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=129.64s)]
*  In this episode, I really want to cover what we're expecting to see and the impacts on [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=132.35999999999999s)]
*  cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, on AI, on humanoid robots, on flying cars, autonomous cars, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=139.88000000000002s)]
*  biotech deregulation, space exploration. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=148.20000000000002s)]
*  I mean, how about you? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=150.44s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=152.52s)]
*  And I think there's a really important commentary also as to how do you policy formulation [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=153.52s)]
*  when technology is moving so quickly. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=158.32000000000002s)]
*  I think that's a key area. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=160.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's called like racing headlong into a brick wall. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=162.16000000000003s)]
*  I mean, honestly, I would not want to be in the government for a number of reasons right [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=167.23999999999998s)]
*  now, but in particular, because things are moving so fast. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=172.76s)]
*  We're trying to match government regulation with the speed of technology change. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=177.88s)]
*  And it's an impedance mismatch if you're an electrical engineer. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=184.23999999999998s)]
*  It's like impossible. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=189.44s)]
*  Well, one of the ways we talk about this is that most government policy is defensive and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=190.44s)]
*  reactive. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=196.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=197.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=198.12s)]
*  And there's only two places in the world that do forward thinking government policy, which [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=199.12s)]
*  is Singapore and Dubai. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=202.68s)]
*  And even there, they don't do it that well. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=204.6s)]
*  I think one of the incredible opportunities for any government around the world, including [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=206.96s)]
*  a new government arriving, is we know passenger drones are coming. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=210.6s)]
*  Let's formulate the regulatory early so that we can kind of figure things out. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=214.96s)]
*  That way, when they arrive, you're not losing decades waiting for policy to catch up. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=219.32s)]
*  Yeah, without a target, you'll miss it every time. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=223.96s)]
*  Let's just jump in here. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=227.4s)]
*  I think the first place I'd love to have a conversation with you is on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=228.76s)]
*  We have seen a lot of movement in the markets, and we've seen Trump and his team speak about [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=237.12s)]
*  being the Bitcoin president. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=246.52s)]
*  My fraternity brother and past roommate, Michael Saylor from MicroStrategy has been tweeting [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=248.96s)]
*  up a storm. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=254.24s)]
*  How do you think about this? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=256.16s)]
*  Obviously, I'm very optimistic as a fellow Bitcoin maximalist. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=257.6s)]
*  I think there's incredible opportunity now. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=263.08s)]
*  I think the crypto stuff has been lagging behind. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=265.12s)]
*  The US has been woefully behind many other regulatory structures, and therefore, all [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=267.52s)]
*  the crypto developments happening in other places in the world, which is pathetic given [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=272.2s)]
*  the innovation potential of the US. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=276.88s)]
*  I think that's a huge opportunity. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=279.52s)]
*  I think the huge challenge is the challenge that crypto and Bitcoin specifically present [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=281.76s)]
*  to the US dollar hegemony. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=288.24s)]
*  I think that's the tension that's going to have to be played out over the next few years. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=291.0s)]
*  Agreed. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=295.59999999999997s)]
*  I found it interesting Trump saying that he's going to hold on to all these Bitcoin and [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=296.59999999999997s)]
*  piggy bank in the government, which I actually think is a very good move. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=304.88s)]
*  Having seen El Salvador and other countries begin to base policy and economy on Bitcoin [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=309.56s)]
*  as a stabilizing force. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=316.88s)]
*  Just to echo Michael Saylor, we have 200 fiat currencies. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=318.92s)]
*  It makes no sense to have that many. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=327.44s)]
*  We don't really need that many. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=329.2s)]
*  We need a store value. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=331.52s)]
*  You need a means of exchange. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  You need a unit of account. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=334.92s)]
*  We can do a lot now with the potential of Bitcoin, which is a global digital technology [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=337.6s)]
*  replacement for stores of value. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=343.84000000000003s)]
*  There was a great commentary around the fact that money has always been represented by [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=347.32s)]
*  traditionally the hardest thing to make. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=353.0s)]
*  Seashells, we used to use as money because they were hard to make. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=355.72s)]
*  You could only find a few rare ones like that. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=359.84000000000003s)]
*  Today it's hard to mine. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=362.2s)]
*  Bitcoin is really hard to mine. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=364.72s)]
*  It actually gives it credibility because it's so hard to mine. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=366.04s)]
*  You can't fake it in that sense. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=369.0s)]
*  I think there's incredible potential here to operate now, create a global store of value. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=371.0s)]
*  How that juxtaposes with the fiat systems is going to be the big question. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=375.88s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=381.12s)]
*  I remember when I was young, people would get a saving certificate at weddings or at [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=382.48s)]
*  birthdays. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=391.44s)]
*  In the last few years, I've been giving out Bitcoin to folks when they're married or [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=392.44s)]
*  on a special occasion. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=399.32s)]
*  No longer an entire Bitcoin, but some percentage of Bitcoin. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=401.2s)]
*  I think for the long run, the whole idea of a saving certificate was long-term thinking, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=406.4s)]
*  a 20-year or 30-year thinking. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=412.2s)]
*  I think Bitcoin is going to be replacing that. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=413.88s)]
*  I remember the first time I heard about Bitcoin was from you on the stage at Singularity University. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=417.92s)]
*  Then I got religion. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=424.84s)]
*  I went on CNBC and said, sell all your gold and buy Bitcoin, which I did back then. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=425.84s)]
*  Never enough. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=432.2s)]
*  You've been on stages, a number of stages, even more recently, an X-Price saying, buy [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=434.08s)]
*  Bitcoin. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=441.68s)]
*  There was a great cartoon I saw and it said, Dad, do you remember when Bitcoin was below [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=442.68s)]
*  $100,000? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=448.68s)]
*  I think we're going to be there soon. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=449.68s)]
*  We will there. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=453.64s)]
*  I ran across somebody at a family office conference last weekend who said to me, hey, Sleem, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=454.64s)]
*  I met you at a couple of the early abundance conferences and the abundance summits. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=460.52s)]
*  You guys gave us all a few Bitcoins each and I lost it. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=466.2s)]
*  I find there's two people that I run across from 10 years ago. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=473.24s)]
*  My God, you mentioned Bitcoin and I bought a bunch and God bless you. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=479.88s)]
*  The other is you talked about Bitcoin, I didn't buy any and God damn it. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=483.76s)]
*  Either way, it's really, really kind of a point in time. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=488.72s)]
*  In 2014 at the abundance summit, I had a Bitcoin ATM and I gave everybody a hexadecimal hash [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=493.84000000000003s)]
*  code for Bitcoin and I said, here you are, here's a gift, don't lose this, it's valuable [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=502.52s)]
*  and they did, of course. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=509.2s)]
*  Anyway, not as bad as folks who have lost hard drives worth of thousands of Bitcoin [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=510.92s)]
*  in the end. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=515.52s)]
*  I think the statistic is we've lost about 20% of Bitcoin to lost hard drives, et cetera, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=516.56s)]
*  et cetera. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=522.24s)]
*  It's important to note for the folks that are freaking out because they missed the boat [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=523.24s)]
*  that the first three, four, five years of Bitcoin, it was a huge question mark whether [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=526.64s)]
*  it would make it or not because so many different attempts at digital stores of value have been [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=530.72s)]
*  attempted in the past, hash cash, e-cash, digital gold, et cetera. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=535.0799999999999s)]
*  It took a few years before people clicked in that the engagement model, going back to [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=540.64s)]
*  the EXO model, the engagement model and the gamification was so powerful that it was a [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=545.0s)]
*  positive feedback loop and it was here to stay. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=549.64s)]
*  I think it's really, really powerful. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=552.0s)]
*  Before we leave this subject, there's something else coming I think is going to be enabled [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=554.04s)]
*  and empowered by this administration, which is digitizing assets. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=558.12s)]
*  The whole realm of like if you own an apartment building in Miami or in Central Park West [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=563.92s)]
*  or you own a valuable piece of artwork that you could digitize it effectively and sell [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=571.6s)]
*  a crypto version or a percentage of it. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=582.72s)]
*  Can you speak to that? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=585.92s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=586.92s)]
*  I mean, the many you can do that, that's huge. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=587.92s)]
*  Something big has happened over the last couple of years. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=590.4399999999999s)]
*  For folks that are interested, go check out a company called Materium led by Vine Gupta, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=593.76s)]
*  who was the head of community for Ethereum when it launched. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=598.32s)]
*  He was the launch manager I think for Vitalik and team. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=602.72s)]
*  What he's been doing over the last seven years is trying to figure out the legal stack between [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=606.36s)]
*  if I have a digital token that represents some rare bottle of wine, do I have the legal [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=611.72s)]
*  standing to be able to collect on a bottle of wine? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=616.5200000000001s)]
*  He solved that problem. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=620.1600000000001s)]
*  I think it works in like 170 countries already. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=621.1600000000001s)]
*  So therefore, we can now tokenize anything and represent it with digital tokens and fractionalize [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=625.24s)]
*  any asset. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=630.78s)]
*  I think this will unlock the most extraordinary potential since the floating of the dollar [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=631.78s)]
*  off the US gold standard. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=637.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=639.36s)]
*  I mean, this is trillions, tens of trillions of dollars. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=640.36s)]
*  Well, the global economy is close to 600 trillion. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=644.2s)]
*  About half of that is real estate. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=647.6800000000001s)]
*  So if you just digitized proper land titles, right? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=650.04s)]
*  Now you have like you've got half of the world's wealth that can be fractionalized that way [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=655.48s)]
*  and infinitesimally fractionalized. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=660.4399999999999s)]
*  So I could own a tenth of a piece of a room of a New York condo if I want to. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=662.88s)]
*  And the beautiful thing is it comes along with certain rights where you get a day, a [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=669.8s)]
*  of being able to sleep in there or being able to assign that right to somebody else. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=675.48s)]
*  And so you can own another company focused in this area is Abra and Republic. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=681.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=687.96s)]
*  I'm going to have Bill Barheight at Abundance 360 this year speaking about their efforts [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=688.96s)]
*  on digitizing assets and being able to fund a fraction of a movie. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=693.24s)]
*  Like if like there's a movie in production by James Cameron, you can you can fund a fraction [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=703.28s)]
*  of it and you get certain rights for the opening or for seats or whatever the case might be. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=708.5999999999999s)]
*  As soon as you digitize ownership, you can add secondary rights besides just ownership [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=713.68s)]
*  onto those. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=718.86s)]
*  I think this is this unlocks so many things. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=720.12s)]
*  We've been watching this, by the way, in the NFT world as people are innovating very, very [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=722.88s)]
*  Every project learns from the last six months of projects and does something new. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=729.6s)]
*  And that whole ecosystem is moving faster than anything I've ever seen except for maybe [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=734.0400000000001s)]
*  AI. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=738.2800000000001s)]
*  So bottom line, Salim, is we've got a Republican administration coming in. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=739.2800000000001s)]
*  What should be their policy on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=744.8800000000001s)]
*  Well I think let's separate Bitcoin from cryptocurrency just for the second. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=750.0s)]
*  But two things I think are really critical. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=753.84s)]
*  Right now, every cryptocurrency transaction is taxed as property. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=756.3s)]
*  So you have a capital gains. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=761.26s)]
*  If I wanted to buy a cup of coffee with crypto, that's a capital gains tax event, which slows [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=762.9399999999999s)]
*  down the adoption radically. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=767.78s)]
*  I would change that rule so that you could clearly separate between stores of value and [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=769.4599999999999s)]
*  means of exchange. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=773.9799999999999s)]
*  If I'm using the payment, doing payment for goods and services using crypto, that should [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=774.9799999999999s)]
*  be taxed as if it's a taxable transaction, not as a frickin property tax. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=779.6999999999999s)]
*  As an asset tax. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=785.26s)]
*  I think that's one. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=787.98s)]
*  I think the second is to much more allow the financial world to accept Bitcoin as a store [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=788.98s)]
*  of value. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=794.6999999999999s)]
*  For example, financial advisors are not allowed to talk about Bitcoin to their own clients. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=795.6999999999999s)]
*  I said to my mom, I said, Mom, listen, I would love if you would please diversify and put [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=802.38s)]
*  some of your assets into Bitcoin. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=809.9399999999999s)]
*  Or at least into a Bitcoin ETF. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=812.98s)]
*  And her, whoever, Morgan Stanley, whoever, was like, not allowed to do that. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=816.9s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=821.34s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=822.34s)]
*  So I went and looked into why and it turns out the risk of Bitcoin is too high for them [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=823.34s)]
*  to accept from a professional perspective. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=827.54s)]
*  They don't want to take on that risk, which is ridiculous, right? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=829.82s)]
*  If the client wants it. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=832.82s)]
*  And this other, hello, how about free market? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=834.3000000000001s)]
*  So I think that would be an area to change and change the game on. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=836.58s)]
*  So there's all sorts of areas around the financial regulatory that could be undone. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=840.4599999999999s)]
*  I think that's where an area where we could do quite a lot of updating of regulatory structures [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=845.0999999999999s)]
*  that are desperately out of date and serving nobody but the legacy environments. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=852.62s)]
*  There will be some dramatic changes within the SEC very shortly. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=857.38s)]
*  All right. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=862.18s)]
*  Bottom line is, I think you opened up with that point. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=864.42s)]
*  The US should be leading and not following and most definitely not retarding progress [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=868.34s)]
*  in this. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=875.46s)]
*  It is a definitive. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=876.46s)]
*  It is coming. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=877.46s)]
*  It is moving at accelerating speed. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=878.46s)]
*  One of the things that people need to realize is that as we get to AGI and agents and digital [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=882.58s)]
*  intelligence, the ability for AI systems to be able to transact financially is what [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=892.22s)]
*  is going to unlock yet another superexponential. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=900.82s)]
*  And the only way you do that is with digital currencies. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=904.62s)]
*  That's right. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=907.5400000000001s)]
*  And so it's going to happen and it should happen here in the US. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=909.6600000000001s)]
*  Otherwise that superexponential call is going to occur overseas someplace. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=915.5s)]
*  I just want to touch on one piece of this because lots of people don't click into this. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=921.54s)]
*  For me, the magic of crypto is not that it is digital. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=925.46s)]
*  The US dollar has been digital for a long time. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=929.74s)]
*  It's the fact that I can program a transaction and modify behavior. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=932.1s)]
*  So for example, if I was to buy that nice jacket that you're wearing, right now I have [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=936.98s)]
*  to kind of hope that I send you the money. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=942.46s)]
*  I hope you send it to me. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=944.3s)]
*  And we have eBay as middlemen and take extracting a tax for things like that. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=945.86s)]
*  And we pay a lot of money for that incremental tax. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=950.6999999999999s)]
*  In the future, I can basically say, hey, I'm going to send you $100. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=955.02s)]
*  The system keeps it in escrow programmatically. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=958.66s)]
*  You send the jacket. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=961.3s)]
*  The minute I accept delivery, it releases the money to you. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=962.3s)]
*  And the whole thing is done programmatically with almost zero transaction cost. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=964.9399999999999s)]
*  And that I think is important. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=969.98s)]
*  And I just want to touch on one thing, which is where we're going to get resistance from [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=971.78s)]
*  this is Wall Street. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=974.86s)]
*  I came across the most ridiculous fact. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=976.06s)]
*  Over the last 20 years or so, 40% of American corporate profits are the financial sector. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=979.14s)]
*  40%. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=985.7s)]
*  That's just a ridiculous number of the tax on the money going through the system. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=986.7s)]
*  So I'm hoping that the deregulation starts to help to unwind that. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=991.98s)]
*  But there's going to be very fierce resistance from the banker types that go, no, every transaction [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=997.02s)]
*  should go through us, et cetera. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1001.3000000000001s)]
*  Well guess what? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1004.38s)]
*  Things change fast. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1005.74s)]
*  And I think the opportunity for crypto to bridge across into real world applications [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1007.1800000000001s)]
*  is now enabled 100x than it was, say, two years ago. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1013.1s)]
*  I would love to talk about the fact that you put a mortgage on your home to buy Bitcoin [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1018.1800000000001s)]
*  a few years back. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1022.14s)]
*  But I'm not going to try shit. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1023.3s)]
*  Lily is still smarting over that one. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1026.3s)]
*  Well, listen, now she's happy because Bitcoin is like flowing through the roof, literally, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1028.14s)]
*  of the house. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1032.66s)]
*  Never happy. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1034.66s)]
*  She's happier. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1035.66s)]
*  Happier. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1036.66s)]
*  OK. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1037.66s)]
*  Well, hey, so listen, let's switch from Bitcoin to crypto. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1038.66s)]
*  I also want to just make a point here because I'll get in trouble otherwise. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1041.66s)]
*  Lily has been an incredibly supportive partner around all this with the very reasonable caveat [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1046.6200000000001s)]
*  of, look, distribute the risk a bit because you just don't know. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1052.02s)]
*  And that's correct. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1055.46s)]
*  You and I would throw everything at these things. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1056.46s)]
*  And so it's really, really powerful and important to have that balancing voice. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1060.6200000000001s)]
*  But have we ever been wrong? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1064.5s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1065.78s)]
*  No, no, except for those 16 times. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1066.78s)]
*  Listen, I'll vouch for you. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1069.78s)]
*  You vouch for me on this one. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1072.78s)]
*  Boom. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1074.26s)]
*  Did you see the movie Oppenheimer? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1075.26s)]
*  If you did, did you know that besides building the atomic bomb at Los Alamos National Labs, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1077.34s)]
*  that they spent billions on bio-defense weapons, the ability to accurately detect viruses and [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1084.2s)]
*  microbes by reading their RNA? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1090.26s)]
*  Well, a company called Viome exclusively licensed the technology from Los Alamos Labs to build [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1092.5s)]
*  a platform that can measure your microbiome and the RNA in your blood. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1098.62s)]
*  Now, Viome has a product that I've personally used for years called Full Body Intelligence, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1103.62s)]
*  which collects a few drops of your blood, spit in stool, and can tell you so much about [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1108.3s)]
*  your health. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1112.58s)]
*  They've tested over 700,000 individuals and used their AI models to deliver members critical [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1113.58s)]
*  health guidance. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1118.7s)]
*  Like, what foods you should eat? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1119.7s)]
*  What foods you shouldn't eat? [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1121.42s)]
*  As well as your supplements and probiotics, your biological age, and other deep health [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1122.9s)]
*  insights. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1127.98s)]
*  And the results of the recommendations are nothing short of stellar. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1128.98s)]
*  As reported in the American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine, after just six months of following [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1132.66s)]
*  Viome's recommendations, members reported the following. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1137.6200000000001s)]
*  A 36% reduction in depression, a 40% reduction in anxiety, a 30% reduction in diabetes, and [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1140.8200000000002s)]
*  a 48% reduction in IBS. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1148.94s)]
*  Listen, I've been using Viome for three years. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1151.26s)]
*  I know that my oral and gut health is one of my highest priorities. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1153.74s)]
*  Best of all, Viome is affordable, which is part of my mission to democratize health. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1159.06s)]
*  If you want to join me on this journey, go to Viome.com slash Peter. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1164.1200000000001s)]
*  I've asked Naveen Jain, a friend of mine who's the founder and CEO of Viome, to give my listeners [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1167.94s)]
*  a special discount. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1172.52s)]
*  You'll find it at Viome.com slash Peter. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1173.98s)]
*  So we've got to talk about AI. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1178.02s)]
*  It's coming strong. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1182.78s)]
*  Last week, I was in Saudi and interviewing Elon on stage at the FI8 summit. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1184.82s)]
*  And then I interviewed Eric Schmidt and Ben Horowitz and the CEO of TikTok and SVP of [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1192.9s)]
*  NVIDIA and Travis from the past founder of Uber. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1201.06s)]
*  And it's like literally the entire conversation at this event of 5,000 world leaders and investors [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1205.1799999999998s)]
*  is all about AI all the time. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1213.2199999999998s)]
*  And so it is the underlying conversation underpinning everything. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1215.9399999999998s)]
*  And there are lots of implications that we should talk about them. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1226.3799999999999s)]
*  And I want to hit on them top of mind right now is, is AI able to be regulated? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1231.02s)]
*  Should it be regulated? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1236.58s)]
*  Number two, there is an AI arms race going on. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1238.54s)]
*  It's not even between governments, it's between companies. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1242.44s)]
*  And how do we think about that? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1248.26s)]
*  Number three, this flows directly into energy, right? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1249.9199999999998s)]
*  The amount of energy that we have to produce is extraordinary. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1254.3s)]
*  And one of the conversations taking place on stage was, listen, we're not going to meet [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1260.9s)]
*  all of the climate crisis goals because we need to invest every form of energy to drive [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1265.98s)]
*  AI. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1275.38s)]
*  But AI is going to help us address the climate crisis. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1276.38s)]
*  So how do you think about that? [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1280.26s)]
*  Okay, there's a bunch to unpack here. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1281.98s)]
*  Let me touch on regulatory first, right? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1284.3s)]
*  I made this comment with you a few months ago that Elon actually retweeted a two-minute [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1287.26s)]
*  clip of this where I said, I don't see any mechanism at all that you can regulate AI. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1292.46s)]
*  The horses left the barn. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1299.7s)]
*  You'd have to regulate every line of code written. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1301.54s)]
*  And it's put so many interventions in. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1304.94s)]
*  Because somebody could create a private open source model and boom, you've got all the [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1306.78s)]
*  capabilities that you do in the closed source models. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1310.58s)]
*  I don't see that. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1313.7s)]
*  I mean, one of the hopeful areas was by the size of the model. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1315.74s)]
*  But because now we're doing training on small models, that goes out the window. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1319.06s)]
*  So it's one of those where the minute you try and structure a framework for the regulatory, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1323.66s)]
*  that framework is broken because the technology is advancing so fast. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1328.14s)]
*  And we can talk a little bit more about how do you do regulatory in general. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1331.42s)]
*  So I'm on the camp that says I just don't see a mechanism of any kind. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1335.24s)]
*  I did have a conversation with the Lord Mayor of London, who's a bit of a brain on some [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1339.22s)]
*  of this, who thinks that ISO standards are a path to it. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1343.82s)]
*  So if I claim I'm ISO certified on whatever AI standard that is approved, ISO will actually [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1347.58s)]
*  certify whether my AI systems meet the criteria or not. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1355.62s)]
*  I think what's going to happen here is the private market will navigate this. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1360.46s)]
*  For example, if I'm using a data set as a bank, I really need to make sure that that [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1364.26s)]
*  set is AI clean and authentic and not using dodgy data. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1370.3799999999999s)]
*  And therefore, there's also AI auditing systems and companies that audit AI systems that are [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1374.9199999999998s)]
*  popping up to help with that. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1379.3799999999999s)]
*  So I think the market will navigate this much faster than the government will be able to. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1381.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1385.6599999999999s)]
*  I don't think the government can regulate it. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1386.6599999999999s)]
*  It moves at the speed of conversation versus technology. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1389.4199999999998s)]
*  It moves at a legal pace, which is infinitesimally slower than conversation. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1395.98s)]
*  One of the places that AI is going to be disruptive is going to be the legal system. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1400.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1405.14s)]
*  There's a big movement popping up in my EXO community of saying, okay, let's figure out [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1406.14s)]
*  the future of legal using these different tools, because there's all sorts of areas [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1413.46s)]
*  like contract drafting and discovery, et cetera, that can be completely automated. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1417.46s)]
*  It's going to be amazing. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1421.94s)]
*  One of the most interesting conversations, I had a meeting this morning with my abundance [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1423.42s)]
*  patrons and we're talking about HR. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1427.26s)]
*  And I said, listen, the very best HR support you're going to have as a CEO is going to [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1430.46s)]
*  be an AI system that's able to listen to, view the conversations on email traffic of [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1435.3400000000001s)]
*  your servers, or have a conversation with every employee, understand their grievances, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1441.42s)]
*  understand their point of views, integrate it all and sort of separate the noise from [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1446.1000000000001s)]
*  the high signal. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1452.18s)]
*  Like, yes, this is really...and then give you directly as a CEO. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1453.18s)]
*  I personally think a great chief HR officer should be reporting directly to the CEO. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1457.8600000000001s)]
*  It's your mechanism for tapping into your people, which today is your scarcest, most [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1464.46s)]
*  important resource. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1471.5800000000002s)]
*  So, I came across a company over the last couple of weeks that does something amazing. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1472.5800000000002s)]
*  They drop an AI into your backend systems and it sucks up all the slack in the HubSpot [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1477.0200000000002s)]
*  and Salesforce data and traps it all. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1481.34s)]
*  It can instantly store all the key information so that if you lose a key employee, you don't [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1485.74s)]
*  lose institutional information, which is one of the hardest things. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1491.06s)]
*  And the second thing it does, they can instantly create training modules for every task in [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1495.54s)]
*  the company. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1499.62s)]
*  And it's like Palantir in a box. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1501.3799999999999s)]
*  It's a SaaS platform. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1503.3s)]
*  So, it's going to be unbelievably inexpensive. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1504.3s)]
*  The value creation here is unbelievable. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1506.3s)]
*  And now you never have to...it's just like because AIs are so good at maintaining software [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1509.3799999999999s)]
*  now, we never have to worry about software maintenance in the future. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1512.82s)]
*  And I think that will propagate to all sorts of other areas really quickly. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1515.34s)]
*  You know, I had on stage last year, Gil Verdan, who heads the effective accelerationist movement. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1519.1s)]
*  And I am like vibrating with the level of energy, the speed that things are going to [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1527.4199999999998s)]
*  move. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1535.62s)]
*  We're really entering into a hyper exponential period of change where the challenge is going [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1536.62s)]
*  to be the ability of entrepreneurs to...or actually, sorry, the ability of existing companies [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1543.06s)]
*  to onboard all these new technologies and get out of their own way. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1550.6599999999999s)]
*  Can I be blunt? [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1555.26s)]
*  That's what you teach at exponential organizations or what we wrote about in our book. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1557.26s)]
*  A big time. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1560.62s)]
*  And I don't see, in fact, you know, look at how difficult...it's taken like 20, 30 years [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1561.78s)]
*  for companies just to digitize, right? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1565.86s)]
*  The metabolism change to AIs, another step function, order of magnitude. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1569.26s)]
*  So the opportunity for entrepreneurs is unbelievable. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1575.6599999999999s)]
*  The big problem, I think, is at what model level do you plant your flag if you're building [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1578.06s)]
*  an AI startup, right? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1584.3799999999999s)]
*  I'll go back to Kevin Kelly's famous comment from 10 years ago where he said the next 10,000 [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1586.54s)]
*  business plans will say take a domain, add AI to it. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1591.86s)]
*  Looks like it did 100 years ago with electricity. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1594.86s)]
*  So again, you know, what's going to happen on the government level as a result of this? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1597.9799999999998s)]
*  I think one policy change we're going to see is build, build, build on a few levels. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1602.6999999999998s)]
*  Energy production, we should talk about that. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1612.26s)]
*  And the hyperscalers. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1615.1799999999998s)]
*  I think that there's a perceived sense that we're in a race against China, though I don't [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1616.62s)]
*  know that that's actually true because China doesn't have the GPUs. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1623.74s)]
*  I had another person on stage I interviewed was Kaifu Li. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1629.6200000000001s)]
*  Kaifu is amazing, right? [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1633.3400000000001s)]
*  He worked at Apple. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1634.8600000000001s)]
*  He was the head of Microsoft China, the head of Apple China. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1636.54s)]
*  He now has a company called BeGo, which is a new search engine that's based in the US. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1639.78s)]
*  These are three or four billion dollar VC fund called Sinnovations out of China. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1649.66s)]
*  And he's saying we had to reinvent our AI systems for efficiency because we only could [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1655.7s)]
*  get 2000 GPUs. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1662.74s)]
*  For comparison, you know, Elon stood up XAI in 122 days with 100,000 H100s. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1667.6200000000001s)]
*  And now he's doubling it again to 200,000, the largest cluster ever. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1678.28s)]
*  And so there is an arms race, but it's between companies. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1685.52s)]
*  And also, you know, I had a conversation with Gile Verdan at Visioneering two weeks ago, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1690.1200000000001s)]
*  right? [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1695.8s)]
*  Xprize is your thing. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1696.8s)]
*  And his proposed prize was doing training AI models and chip architectures 10,000 times [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1698.48s)]
*  cheaper than today's architectures. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1705.6s)]
*  Well, actually, 10,000 times less energy. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1708.48s)]
*  Energy efficient, right. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1711.32s)]
*  But when you can go price performance that much of a difference, remember, that means [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1712.88s)]
*  we're using 10,000 times less energy. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1717.24s)]
*  So I think a combination of decreasing architecture costs, price performance wise, or increasing [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1719.96s)]
*  performance on that side, plus today, more than 50% of Bitcoin is renewable energy, right? [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1726.64s)]
*  And we forget how much energy availability there is in the world. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1734.44s)]
*  I was in Kazakhstan earlier in the summer, and there's a guy building, there's a gigawatt [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1737.96s)]
*  wind farm that's been created out in the middle of nowhere in Kazakhstan, but it's useless [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1742.76s)]
*  because they can't get that energy because the transmission costs are too high to get [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1746.7s)]
*  it anywhere useful. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1750.68s)]
*  Great, stack a Bitcoin mining farm and an AI data center next to it, and it's completely [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1751.68s)]
*  useful. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1756.6000000000001s)]
*  So we're going to tap all of these energy sources all over the world, pockets of them [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1757.6000000000001s)]
*  that can't be used for anything else. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1761.52s)]
*  And I think we'll go down this incremental and marginal renewable energy sources that [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1763.92s)]
*  can't be used elsewhere, and that will completely solve the problem as those two curves intersect [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1769.0s)]
*  of radically new chip architectures that decrease energy usage plus increased marginal cost [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1773.76s)]
*  of energy demand supply curves. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1780.44s)]
*  It is crazy. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1784.44s)]
*  So let's talk about where the energy is going to come from, because I think that needs to [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1785.5600000000002s)]
*  be part of our conversation. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1792.44s)]
*  Check out this image here. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1795.28s)]
*  This is just recent. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1796.8200000000002s)]
*  That red line down there is India, went from one terawatt hour production to two, it's [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1801.1200000000001s)]
*  doubled. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1808.96s)]
*  You look at that green line, it's China. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1809.96s)]
*  In 2010, China was producing four terawatts. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1814.0s)]
*  It's doubled and it's doubling again by 2030. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1817.8s)]
*  They're just unleashing as much energy as possible, and the US has been pretty flat. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1821.4s)]
*  But what's interesting, and we're at four terawatts and have been, but going back to [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1826.4s)]
*  AI, the projected demand, if we're really building out all these hyperscalers, it could [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1831.0800000000002s)]
*  consume 100% of the US energy production by 2030. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1839.92s)]
*  So the conversation going on in Saudi at the Future Investment Initiative conference was [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1843.52s)]
*  we need as much energy as we can from every possible source, which means wind and solar, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1851.48s)]
*  fusion in the future, generation four nuclear, which by the way is super safe. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1859.72s)]
*  And Cam, the CEO of Axiom Space, also is the chairman of EnergyX. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1868.8s)]
*  They just signed a contract with Amazon for gen four nuclear power production, which is [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1876.04s)]
*  crazy. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1882.52s)]
*  Look at these companies are signing contracts for nuclear power supplies for their AI factories. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1883.52s)]
*  I'm excited about the private sector stepping up here. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1890.44s)]
*  Gen four nuclear has been safe for a long time. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1893.92s)]
*  I think the best thing governments can do is say go to town because we know it's safe [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1896.1599999999999s)]
*  and build, build, build. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1900.8799999999999s)]
*  What I'm hoping is that we start building nuclear fusion wind solar, which is already [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1903.1599999999999s)]
*  way cheaper than fossil fuels rather than going backwards and burning more fossil fuels [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1910.0s)]
*  because that would be... [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1913.9599999999998s)]
*  And perovskite, perovskite solar, right? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1915.36s)]
*  If folks haven't heard about perovskite, it's another tech I'll be featuring at Abundance [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1918.6s)]
*  this year. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1924.0s)]
*  It is 50% more energy per square meter and as much as 50% cheaper. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1925.0s)]
*  And it's just incredible. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1933.88s)]
*  Important to note here that perovskite replaces the silicon solar panels where we use all [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1936.56s)]
*  the rare earth elements. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1941.4s)]
*  So that's double impact there. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1942.56s)]
*  It's actually kind of a salt that's very widely abundant and they found it has the properties [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1944.88s)]
*  of trapping solar energy. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1949.28s)]
*  And as you mentioned, Peter, it's been in the labs for a while and now it's getting [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1951.68s)]
*  to commercial scale and this is incredibly exciting for the future because you'll be [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1954.48s)]
*  able to spray that onto windows and onto roofs and whatever. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1958.48s)]
*  It can really change the game. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1962.2800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, Paranova is producing a 100 megawatt plant in Texas. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1964.0400000000002s)]
*  They were going to see a lot of progress. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1966.76s)]
*  There is so much solar to be captured. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1970.5200000000002s)]
*  It's there as energy. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1972.92s)]
*  It's not in a usable form yet. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1974.5200000000002s)]
*  But coming back to AI because people are scared about it and I think, you know, listen, from [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1976.52s)]
*  my standpoint, I don't know about you, I think I know your position. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1983.72s)]
*  I am worried about AI over the next three to five years during this period of time before [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1987.04s)]
*  we have it's progressed sufficiently. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1994.6s)]
*  Last year at the abundance summit, we had this conversation about digital super intelligence [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=1998.12s)]
*  and my conclusion was, are you, you know, the question was, are you worried about a [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2002.76s)]
*  world where digital super intelligence exists or a world where it doesn't exist? [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2008.48s)]
*  And I think that I'm more worried about us humans in a world where it doesn't exist and [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2016.3600000000001s)]
*  doesn't support us from our irrational thoughts and actions. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2022.16s)]
*  Can I cue up my standard rant here? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2029.2s)]
*  So consider a spectrum of intelligence where you have smarts, you have domain intelligence, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2033.6000000000001s)]
*  you have general intelligence, then you have emotional intelligence, then you go over into [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2039.8400000000001s)]
*  kind of consciousness and broader forms of decision making. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2044.52s)]
*  We've been kind of going across that spectrum with AI, with doing basic calculations, etc. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2051.32s)]
*  Marvin Minsky has this wonderful hierarchy of the ideals of AI where you get to self-reflective [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2056.72s)]
*  and then reflective and then conscious, etc. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2061.68s)]
*  The problem I've got when people worry about computers and AI becoming smarter is that [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2065.48s)]
*  what the hell do you mean by smarter? [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2071.24s)]
*  Because when I make a choice, I'm using my emotional intelligence, I'm using my spiritual [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2073.3199999999997s)]
*  presence and the concept of awareness from the Eastern world, I'm using historical memory [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2079.04s)]
*  intelligence, etc. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2085.7599999999998s)]
*  All sorts of aspects. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2086.96s)]
*  There's about a dozen facets of intelligence that the IQ test does not measure. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2087.96s)]
*  And so when you talk about AI's overtaking human beings in that, a calculator is way [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2093.96s)]
*  faster than doing math or a spreadsheet than a human being anyway. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2098.8s)]
*  It doesn't mean it has intelligence in the same way that a human being does. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2102.96s)]
*  So I really go nuts about this because for me, it's tickling the amygdala that you like [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2107.06s)]
*  to talk about. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2112.2s)]
*  You're provoking, you're stoking people's fear. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2113.2799999999997s)]
*  I see no mechanism of achieving that. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2115.6s)]
*  Mostly, when you get to once you're getting to concepts like consciousness, we don't have [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2118.52s)]
*  a definition for it, we don't have a task for it. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2122.16s)]
*  A subset of consciousness is considered self-awareness and you look like you're self-aware so I attribute [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2125.6s)]
*  that to you. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2130.48s)]
*  I think I'm self-aware but my wife disagrees. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2131.48s)]
*  It's like hard to even start the conversation around some of this stuff but people freak [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2134.96s)]
*  out about the concept without knowing what they're talking about. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2138.12s)]
*  So I'd really love if people would kind of calm down, take a breath, look at what are [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2141.32s)]
*  we talking about with intelligence and then notice that where we're applying AI and computation [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2146.44s)]
*  and so on is in areas where human beings are not good. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2152.96s)]
*  Antilock breaking systems, credit card fraud detection, fuzzy logic in your cameras to [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2156.1600000000003s)]
*  keep them steady, those are all the areas where we're not good. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2160.92s)]
*  That's where we're applying brute force calculation in AI which is where it'll be profoundly things. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2164.1600000000003s)]
*  So I think of AI developing intelligences that are orthogonal and complementary to [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2169.32s)]
*  human intelligence, not replicative of it, at least for a very long time to come. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2173.8s)]
*  I may differ with you there but coming back to the White House and their AI policies, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2179.4s)]
*  the question is going back to original conversation, I don't think there's anything they're going [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2190.84s)]
*  to be able to do to regulate it. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2195.44s)]
*  I think that they're going to view it as America's most important strategic development. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2199.24s)]
*  There's a video I've shown of Sam Altman saying, listen, I don't care how much money we spend, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2207.8399999999997s)]
*  50 million, 500 million, 50 billion, we're building AGI and it's going to be worth it. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2215.0s)]
*  That's his point of view. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2221.3199999999997s)]
*  And then the question is what the hell is AGI anyway? [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2222.6s)]
*  We passed the Turing test months ago or years ago and there's no real, I think we're going [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2225.76s)]
*  to have achieved AGI and not noticed it or not put a line in the sand. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2232.96s)]
*  I agree. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2239.88s)]
*  Can I tell you where I'm incredibly excited and if I was in this administration, I would [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2240.88s)]
*  think about a lot, is government policy. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2244.28s)]
*  So let's say you want to drop inflation by 1%. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2248.4s)]
*  Right now you've got a human being as an economist with a few knobs and levers and they have [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2252.7599999999998s)]
*  no idea what they're doing. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2257.72s)]
*  They're mostly guessing at it and hoping that something may happen or not happen. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2259.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm sorry, I need to disillusion everybody who's watching who thinks the economists know [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2262.56s)]
*  what they're doing when they're moving the... [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2266.4399999999996s)]
*  I mean, because you do some stuff and then you hope it is by far an exact science. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2268.7999999999997s)]
*  Let's just put it that way, it's the most polite. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2273.2799999999997s)]
*  Now if you have an AI with all the access to economic data and that can track transactions [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2276.3999999999996s)]
*  in real time all over the world and you can say, figure out how to drop inflation by 1% [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2281.12s)]
*  and give us the negative consequences of any side effects on other policies and come back [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2288.12s)]
*  to us and then figure it out. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2292.72s)]
*  I think that's where this unbelievable opportunity and a clean slate thought process here would [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2294.44s)]
*  be so powerful to doing some of that type of work, applying it in the areas where we're [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2299.6s)]
*  using fuzzy guesses at best. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2305.52s)]
*  And again, anybody listening who's running a company, same conversation. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2308.88s)]
*  If you're looking to increase your sales, but you're going to have to get the data to [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2314.44s)]
*  enable your AI to know what the hell it's talking about. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2319.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and as I said, we just came across this company where you drop it and it handles it [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2323.28s)]
*  all. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2326.76s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2327.76s)]
*  So everybody, I want to take a short break from our episode to talk about a company that's [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2328.76s)]
*  very important to me and could actually save your life or the life of someone that you [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2331.9s)]
*  love. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2337.04s)]
*  It's called Fountain Life and it's a company I started years ago with Tony Robbins and [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2338.2s)]
*  a group of very talented physicians. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2342.92s)]
*  Most of us don't actually know what's going on inside our body. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2345.92s)]
*  We're all optimists until that day where you have a pain in your side, you go to the physician [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2349.64s)]
*  in the emergency room and they say, listen, I'm sorry to tell you this, but you have this [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2354.92s)]
*  stage three or four going on. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2359.0s)]
*  And it didn't start that morning. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2361.2s)]
*  It probably was a problem that's been going on for some time, but because we never look, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2363.94s)]
*  we don't find out. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2369.5s)]
*  So what we built at Fountain Life was the world's most advanced diagnostic centers. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2371.02s)]
*  We have four across the US today and we're building 20 around the world. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2376.48s)]
*  These centers give you a full body MRI, a brain, a brain vasculature, an AI enabled coronary [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2381.26s)]
*  CT looking for soft plaque, a DEXA scan, a grail blood cancer test, a full executive [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2387.42s)]
*  blood workup. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2393.6600000000003s)]
*  It's the most advanced workup you'll ever receive. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2394.6600000000003s)]
*  150 gigabytes of data that then go to our AIs and our physicians to find any disease [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2398.1000000000004s)]
*  at the very beginning when it's solvable. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2404.82s)]
*  You're going to find out eventually. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2407.94s)]
*  Might as well find out when you can take action. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2409.86s)]
*  Fountain Life also has an entire side of therapeutics. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2412.1800000000003s)]
*  We look around the world for the most advanced therapeutics that can add 10, 20 healthy years [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2415.0800000000004s)]
*  to your life and we provide them to you at our centers. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2419.0s)]
*  So if this is of interest to you, please go and check it out. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2423.84s)]
*  Go to fountainlife.com backslash Peter. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2428.6s)]
*  When Tony and I wrote our New York Times bestseller Life Force, we had 30,000 people reached out [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2432.78s)]
*  to us for Fountain Life memberships. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2438.8s)]
*  If you go to fountainlife.com backslash Peter, we'll put you to the top of the list. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2441.0s)]
*  Really it's something that is for me one of the most important things I offer my entire [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2446.88s)]
*  family, the CEOs of my companies, my friends. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2451.88s)]
*  It's a chance to really add decades onto our healthy lifespans. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2455.6s)]
*  Go to fountainlife.com backslash Peter. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2460.92s)]
*  It's one of the most important things I can offer to you as one of my listeners. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2463.6400000000003s)]
*  All right, let's go back to our episode. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2467.2000000000003s)]
*  So okay, we talked about that. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2469.1600000000003s)]
*  We're also having an adjacency to AI is Humanoid Robotics. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2471.84s)]
*  I'm putting out a meta trend report on Humanoid Robotics in about a week's time and I'm tracking [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2478.4s)]
*  right now 15 of the top companies in Humanoid Robotics. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2485.6800000000003s)]
*  They are of course Tesla with Optimus and they are with Figure 2. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2490.56s)]
*  We've got Atlas from Boston Dynamics and a number of companies out of China, right? [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2498.52s)]
*  So China desperately needs humanoid robots. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2503.7599999999998s)]
*  India is starting up as well as we're seeing so Japan and South Korea. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2507.84s)]
*  It's the countries, in particular China, because it can't survive. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2512.8s)]
*  Can't survive after its one child policy. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2518.08s)]
*  Its low labor rates is what made it the dominant global manufacturing base, but those labor [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2522.44s)]
*  rates are going up and their populations are dwindling. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2529.88s)]
*  So I think this is incredibly exciting at the commercial level. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2534.44s)]
*  I think I get nervous when we talk about domestic robots in the house folding clothes. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2539.16s)]
*  So I look at my Roomba vacuum cleaner robot and I'm still at the point where I'm having [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2547.38s)]
*  to move all the chairs to make way for the thing and by the time I'm done, I might as [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2555.58s)]
*  well just done the vacuuming myself. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2561.06s)]
*  So we've had about a decade of vacuum robots and we've only got marginally better. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2563.38s)]
*  Now humanoids may do very good things, but I'm wondering at what point a mother is comfortable [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2569.6600000000003s)]
*  to a human robot go change the diapers on the kid because that requires like the and [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2574.94s)]
*  the liability issues. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2579.7799999999997s)]
*  By the way, can I take a quick segue into the regulatory here for a second? [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2581.8599999999997s)]
*  Of course, you can. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2585.74s)]
*  So I've been talking to a few insurance companies and I've come up with an I've kind of gained [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2587.06s)]
*  this out. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2592.2599999999998s)]
*  I don't see how we don't end up in this scenario where insurance companies go to the government [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2593.2599999999998s)]
*  and say you cannot regulate humanoid robots or drones or whatever the technology is. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2597.42s)]
*  We have the liability insurance risk structure plus a capital base that can mitigate it. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2603.22s)]
*  Why don't you just say if you can get liability insurance for your application, we're good. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2608.2599999999998s)]
*  You let it go. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2614.4599999999996s)]
*  And I think that's what's going to happen because then the insurance companies have [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2616.22s)]
*  the mechanism to manage it at that use case level and say, okay, if the robot is cleaning [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2619.7s)]
*  windows and it's limited to cleaning windows, fine. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2625.7s)]
*  You can use whatever you want with a robot doing cleaning windows. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2628.8199999999997s)]
*  The minute it gets to clipping the hair of a pet, if it makes a mistake, you could have [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2632.5s)]
*  a problem or changing the diaper on the baby. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2637.62s)]
*  Whoa, I can't give you liability insurance for that. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2640.22s)]
*  I think there's a segue here where I think that's what's going to end up happening and [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2642.74s)]
*  it allows us to move the domain much more quickly. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2646.14s)]
*  But I think we're a long way away from a general humanoid robot. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2648.74s)]
*  I think specialized use cases like empty the dishwasher and put things there. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2653.06s)]
*  One of the things that I got really excited about 10 years ago was Baxter, the robot. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2658.42s)]
*  I remember Baxter, yes. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2663.14s)]
*  And the power system. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2664.78s)]
*  Rodney Brooks, right, was the CEO there. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2665.78s)]
*  That's right. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2669.26s)]
*  And I remember Saul Griffith showing us this and the key thing that was such a huge breakthrough [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2670.26s)]
*  is in industrial robotics, you always had to program a robot. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2674.02s)]
*  You had to say, pick up this widget, turn your arm 90 degrees, move over here, put it [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2677.3s)]
*  back, put it down. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2681.82s)]
*  You had to explicitly program it. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2682.82s)]
*  And with Baxter, you could show what to do, adaptively move its arms and then it would [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2683.82s)]
*  figure out the task in that very specific narrow use case and do it from then on. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2688.18s)]
*  I think that potential with LLMs integrated in makes this hugely. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2692.3s)]
*  That's what's going on. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2696.38s)]
*  The difference now is the robots are visually seeing what you as a human does and it's [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2697.86s)]
*  learning from that. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2704.82s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2706.06s)]
*  So it is. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2707.06s)]
*  I just like I wonder how long, you know, would you have a robot cook for you? [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2708.06s)]
*  And what if it, you know, I mean, I don't know. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2713.22s)]
*  I think there'd be sort of like, let me give you, I thought this through a little bit. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2718.02s)]
*  Let me give you. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2721.0600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2722.0600000000004s)]
*  OK. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2723.0600000000004s)]
*  So I've got a humanoid robot standing next to me. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2724.0600000000004s)]
*  OK. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2725.0600000000004s)]
*  And I want to cook an Indian dish, which is very complex, a proper hadrabadi biryani, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2726.0600000000004s)]
*  which is where I was born, takes like six hours to make. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2730.5800000000004s)]
*  OK. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2733.2200000000003s)]
*  So number one, robot, go get all the ingredients for this recipe and pull them all out on the [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2734.2200000000003s)]
*  table. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2738.1800000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2739.1800000000003s)]
*  Number two, take this stack of ingredients and grind them together and roast them in [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2740.1800000000003s)]
*  a frying pan because you need that proper roasting. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2743.7000000000003s)]
*  But it can't smell quite as well as I can. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2745.7799999999997s)]
*  So I have to go over there and do the smelling to make sure it hits at the right level of [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2747.9399999999996s)]
*  the raw smell going away. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2751.7s)]
*  OK, great. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2752.9399999999996s)]
*  Then I will kind of blend it, et cetera. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2753.9399999999996s)]
*  OK, now go watch it and make sure it's OK until it's ready type thing and stir occasionally. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2755.2999999999997s)]
*  So I can see there being an interplay here and there within certain cases. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2761.1s)]
*  But or you take it does the whole thing in an automated way. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2765.7s)]
*  But I just don't see some of the other use cases being as easy. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2770.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2773.7s)]
*  I disagree with you on that. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2774.8599999999997s)]
*  We learn to trust robots called medical devices. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2777.18s)]
*  And there are, you know, I think ultimately these robots are going to be a lot more reliable [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2782.66s)]
*  than humans who forget, who make mistakes, who, you know, don't show up on time. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2790.0s)]
*  There's going to be a learning curve, of course. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2796.02s)]
*  In a medical context, if I'm doing a soldier surgery, right? [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2798.7599999999998s)]
*  Of course, a robot is going to be way better and much more precise. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2802.26s)]
*  And I'd much rather have a robot doing it that has access to every recording of every [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2805.0600000000004s)]
*  operation ever done than that. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2810.0600000000004s)]
*  But if it's doing some adaptive things, this is where it becomes adaptive, where my favorite [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2812.46s)]
*  vase is about to fall over and it's about to vacuum there and it doesn't see that part. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2818.5s)]
*  Those are the areas where I think the lot of those education is why this is why autonomous [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2824.26s)]
*  cars have been so hard. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2828.44s)]
*  And by the way, please know I'm desperately hoping for it, right? [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2830.62s)]
*  I know you are. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2834.1s)]
*  I know you are. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2835.1s)]
*  We've been talking about this together on stages from around the world for the better [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2836.1s)]
*  part of two decades. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2840.18s)]
*  So here's my question coming into a new administration. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2842.14s)]
*  This next four-year period of time is the time during which we're going to see AI and [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2848.5s)]
*  robotics begin to displace jobs? [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2854.86s)]
*  Not worried about jobs. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2858.1s)]
*  You're not worried about jobs? [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2859.74s)]
*  No, for all of the reasons we've talked about before. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2860.74s)]
*  I know we talked about this, but I still believe we're going to see increased efficiencies [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2863.4199999999996s)]
*  and we're going to see job displacement. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2870.06s)]
*  I'll agree with Mark Andreessen here that every major injection of technology has exploded [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2873.22s)]
*  the number of jobs, not reduced it. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2878.14s)]
*  And you have said on stage many times that countries with the highest robotic penetration [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2880.4199999999996s)]
*  Sweden, South Korea, Germany. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2885.14s)]
*  Countries with the lowest unemployment, Sweden, South Korea, Germany. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2887.26s)]
*  The correlations are very clear. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2891.5s)]
*  The data is very clear on this one. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2892.94s)]
*  So I'm not worried about unemployment or job transformation of work. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2894.3s)]
*  Yes. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2898.82s)]
*  And I go down to that idea that let's say I'm a financial advisor for a company like [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2899.82s)]
*  Morgan Stanley. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2908.2200000000003s)]
*  about 27 tasks that comprise my job function. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2911.98s)]
*  And a robot might or AI may automate like eight or 10 of them, but it's not changing [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2917.22s)]
*  the other 17. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2922.38s)]
*  So I still have the job, but I just make the job easier. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2923.38s)]
*  This is like using Excel for calculations rather than running it on a spreadsheet or [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2926.06s)]
*  an abacus or a slider or a calculator. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2930.34s)]
*  And so I think we end up there and it's a long time before we automate a thing. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2933.3s)]
*  Meanwhile, there's also some other jobs that have been created like AI training agents [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2937.98s)]
*  and so on. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2941.7000000000003s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2942.7000000000003s)]
*  I mean, you and I have talked about the need for UBI, universal basic income on the backside [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2943.7000000000003s)]
*  of this. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2950.54s)]
*  If I could see one thing that this administration should go after, it's UBI. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2951.54s)]
*  Well, why? [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2955.34s)]
*  If jobs are not a thing, if jobs are not concerning, why should they go after UBI? [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2956.7400000000002s)]
*  It just unleashes entrepreneurship. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2959.98s)]
*  All the UBI studies have shown that when you give people... [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2961.3s)]
*  I agree with that. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2963.62s)]
*  It's really important to note that you've got to find the balance between giving people [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2964.98s)]
*  too much money and they become too fat and they don't work and not having enough to serve. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2968.54s)]
*  You want to hit the balance where they can survive but not be happy. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2973.38s)]
*  And we've studied these experiments when you can hit that balance, which an AI could figure [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2977.06s)]
*  out by the way. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2981.42s)]
*  You then have a hugely productive economy, but everybody's baseline is still covered. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2983.9s)]
*  And then you can dismantle government services. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2989.1s)]
*  And this is an area where if the Republicans are interested, this is an area... [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2991.58s)]
*  Here's where it's really fascinating. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2996.5s)]
*  I don't know if you've tracked what's been going on in the UBI space, but a large numbers [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=2997.82s)]
*  of cities and states and countries around the world have blocked experiments on UBI. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3002.22s)]
*  No. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3006.98s)]
*  They've said you are not allowed to experiment with UBI. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3007.98s)]
*  Why? [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3010.7799999999997s)]
*  Because they don't want to be true? [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3011.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, they're governments. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3013.58s)]
*  They're scared to not be needed. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3014.86s)]
*  So they've literally passed legislation saying all the towns in my state are not allowed [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3016.82s)]
*  to experiment with UBI. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3021.7000000000003s)]
*  That's freaky. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3023.38s)]
*  That's the area where I think a Trump-type administration could go, are you kidding? [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3024.7400000000002s)]
*  Get rid of all of that crap and let people experiment with it because you need more experiments. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3029.6600000000003s)]
*  All right. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3033.94s)]
*  One of the things that's going to be true about this administration is going to be a [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3034.94s)]
*  massive wave of deregulation. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3038.2200000000003s)]
*  That's going to hit a few industries off the top. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3043.38s)]
*  Biotech is one, space is another. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3047.6200000000003s)]
*  Your choice. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3052.86s)]
*  Which one would you go after first? [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3053.86s)]
*  I'd go after biotech first just because it has such immediate obvious consequences using [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3054.86s)]
*  stem cell therapy. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3060.3s)]
*  Right now, we travel overseas to get stem cell treatments for various things, which [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3061.82s)]
*  is ridiculous, right? [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3065.5800000000004s)]
*  What was that robotic surgery company in intuitive surgical? [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3067.94s)]
*  Intuitive robotics, yes. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3072.7400000000002s)]
*  So I had a friend that lived next door to the factory in San Jose. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3073.7400000000002s)]
*  Because knee surgeries were authorized but not shoulder surgeries, he had to fly to Switzerland [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3079.58s)]
*  to get an intuitive surgical robot to do a shoulder because they didn't authorize it [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3085.5s)]
*  in the US. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3090.02s)]
*  He lived next door to the factory. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3091.02s)]
*  The kind of chaos that we're doing around medical tourism is unbelievable. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3094.1s)]
*  I think the US has an unbelievable opportunity to correct some of that aspect. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3097.54s)]
*  Right now, the FDA focuses on safety rather than efficacy. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3102.86s)]
*  If I could wave one, one and say go after efficacy and not safety. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3106.18s)]
*  The challenge is that you're blamed if there is one problem. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3111.5s)]
*  You're not blamed for all of the lives lost by you blocking the therapy. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3116.46s)]
*  I think this is, for me, because I'm in the biotech and longevity and regenerative medicine [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3121.9s)]
*  world and so forth, it has been, there's so much potential. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3127.98s)]
*  I'm seeing so many incredible companies around the world that are being unlocked because [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3132.14s)]
*  of AI and gene therapies and CRISPR and such. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3137.62s)]
*  But the process of getting it out the door safely has been massively hampered because [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3141.86s)]
*  of the deregulation. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3151.4s)]
*  I talk about the notion of having a process by which an individual has a right to try [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3153.46s)]
*  these therapies. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3165.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3166.46s)]
*  We should be able to sign up for stuff like that and not have, totally agree. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3167.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3174.7s)]
*  We have the sense that the government has to protect me against myself, which is my [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3175.7s)]
*  body, my rights, give me the chance if it's fully sufficiently disclosed. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3179.54s)]
*  Where I disagree somewhat is public health because now if I get a virus and transmitted [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3186.1s)]
*  to lots of other people, I'm damaging a lot of other people. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3190.86s)]
*  That is a mitigation there. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3195.02s)]
*  But for anything at the personal level, I completely 100% agree with you. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3196.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3202.2200000000003s)]
*  So excited about deregulation in the biotech world, in particular in regenerative medicine [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3203.2200000000003s)]
*  in the stem cell world, exosomes and such, even peptides. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3209.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3213.86s)]
*  Now, there's a lot of cowboys out there. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3214.86s)]
*  There's a lot of mom and pop shops that are trying things and advertising. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3217.02s)]
*  At what point do we say, hey, listen, if you're an idiot enough to go and just take the first [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3224.54s)]
*  injection you get, that buyer beware. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3234.54s)]
*  I think caveat emptor applies in many of these cases. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3240.7s)]
*  You just have to be... [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3244.54s)]
*  One danger side that I see coming in this administration is there's been a movement [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3246.9s)]
*  of anti-science. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3251.18s)]
*  Right? [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3252.18s)]
*  Which administration? [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3253.66s)]
*  That's coming. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3254.66s)]
*  There's a huge wave against scientific process and scientific thinking because people put [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3255.66s)]
*  political motivations on people for just trying to understand what the hell is going on with [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3262.2599999999998s)]
*  something. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3268.14s)]
*  There's so much data that we have that I think the one thing I would hope for is that people [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3269.14s)]
*  be as evidentiary as possible. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3274.3799999999997s)]
*  You can go drive yourself crazy with conspiracy theories if you wanted to because you can [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3278.42s)]
*  always find data to support. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3284.18s)]
*  You have massive confirmation bias. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3286.06s)]
*  The actual data... [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3288.8199999999997s)]
*  This is where I think AI can perform a huge service because imagine there's six experiments [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3289.8199999999997s)]
*  on psilocybin somewhere. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3295.34s)]
*  You can analyze the data across those and come up with a meta-analysis that would be [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3297.18s)]
*  very powerful that we can't easily do as human beings, but it could go, you know what? [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3300.62s)]
*  That's actually safe for these types of use cases, et cetera, and you could then deregulate [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3304.94s)]
*  that aspect of it. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3309.1s)]
*  I think there's huge opportunity. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3310.78s)]
*  Somebody has to have the bravery. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3313.1s)]
*  I'll go back to the earlier point of we need to reorient from safety where you won't authorize [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3315.2200000000003s)]
*  a drug if it kills 10 people even though it saves 10,000 people to efficacy. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3320.9s)]
*  That's when you really unlock massive opportunity. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3326.9s)]
*  I know. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3329.54s)]
*  It's even worse than that. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3330.54s)]
*  What percentage of drugs that are prescribed to an individual actually work in an individual? [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3331.54s)]
*  No. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3338.62s)]
*  It's like 20%. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3341.02s)]
*  It's pretty sad. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3345.02s)]
*  When you get a drug prescribed to you, the sense is, oh, that drug's going to work for [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3346.02s)]
*  me. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3350.94s)]
*  But on average, what goes on in the FDA process is in phase one, we look at safety, and then [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3351.94s)]
*  phase two, is it doing what it's supposed to do? [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3363.06s)]
*  In phase three, does it do enough of it? [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3365.14s)]
*  What does enough mean? [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3368.98s)]
*  If it doesn't hurt anybody, but it actually supports 20% of the people, why not approve [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3369.98s)]
*  it? [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3377.5s)]
*  It does get approved. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3378.5s)]
*  People don't realize it doesn't necessarily work for them. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3379.5s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3384.78s)]
*  I think where this becomes workable is once you have personalized testing, you can do [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3385.78s)]
*  personalized adaptation of prescriptions and know that that dosage is right for me, [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3392.78s)]
*  etc. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3400.02s)]
*  Then you're good. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3401.02s)]
*  Real quick, I've been getting the most unusual compliments lately on my skin. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3402.02s)]
*  Truth is, I use a lotion every morning and every night, religiously, called One Skin. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3406.94s)]
*  It was developed by four PhD women who determined a 10 amino acid sequence that is a synolytic [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3412.18s)]
*  that kills senile cells in your skin. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3419.3s)]
*  This literally reverses the age of your skin. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3422.98s)]
*  I think it's one of the most incredible products. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3426.02s)]
*  I use it all the time. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3427.78s)]
*  If you're interested, check out the show notes. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3430.3s)]
*  I've asked my team to link to it below. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3431.94s)]
*  All right, let's get back to the episode. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3433.82s)]
*  Let's go talk about space, my pet childhood interest here. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3436.98s)]
*  Listen, I have to say we're going to be on the moon in a couple years and on Mars before [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3442.42s)]
*  2030. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3449.02s)]
*  That's exciting. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3451.78s)]
*  I think we're going to see another JFK moment where JFK said, I challenge you all to get [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3455.2200000000003s)]
*  to the moon by the end of the decade and bring people back. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3462.14s)]
*  I think we're going to have a challenge to get to Mars by the end of this decade. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3465.54s)]
*  Yeah, just getting them back part of it will make it a lot easier to get there. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3468.94s)]
*  The getting back part is going to be hard. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3475.06s)]
*  I still continue to think that we are bags of water and evolved in a gravitational environment. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3477.06s)]
*  Doing interplanetary travel is going to be very, very difficult. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3488.46s)]
*  I think we'll send robot avatars rather than trying to go out there ourselves. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3493.22s)]
*  But God bless us, we're explorers and we should do that. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3498.66s)]
*  If you had that mentality, you may have never left Europe to find India type of thing. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3501.9399999999996s)]
*  Another use for our humanoid robots. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3507.4599999999996s)]
*  Boom. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3510.58s)]
*  Flying cars, autonomous cars, cyber taxi, drones. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3512.22s)]
*  I find it amazing, one of my favorite drone companies, Zipline, that's now a multi-billion [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3518.94s)]
*  dollar company, had to go and begin business in central East Africa because they had a [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3525.14s)]
*  permissive regulatory regime. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3533.26s)]
*  I think this is the other opportunity for the US to really upgrade its kind of regulatory [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3535.78s)]
*  on a bunch of levels. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3542.9s)]
*  Emerging markets can make new rules. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3545.38s)]
*  I remember in Rwanda, they created a three dimensional tube across the country like a [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3547.46s)]
*  highway and said if your drone stays within that three dimensional aerospace, you can [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3551.2200000000003s)]
*  do whatever you want. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3556.62s)]
*  I think things like that need to be done and done much more aggressively. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3557.62s)]
*  When you fly over the US, it's mostly empty. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3562.7400000000002s)]
*  But most of the time, you're not going to hurt anything. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3564.54s)]
*  Look out the window when you're flying across the United States. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3570.94s)]
*  It is all empty space. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3573.46s)]
*  You fly across India, where I'm from, which is about half the size of the continental [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3576.58s)]
*  US, has like five times the population, three, four times the population and it's freaking [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3580.14s)]
*  empty when you fly across it. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3584.7s)]
*  There's huge opportunities to unlock the abundance of terrestrial land, which is where I think [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3588.06s)]
*  passenger drones become incredibly exciting. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3593.98s)]
*  Let's talk about the future of democracy. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3597.66s)]
*  In a world in which things are moving this fast and humans are moving very slow, how [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3601.7s)]
*  long before our democratic experiment here gets revamped for a world of AI sensors, networks? [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3613.9399999999996s)]
*  Can I lift up a level and then come back down? [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3624.2799999999997s)]
*  Because I actually have been thinking, my community has been thinking about this a great [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3626.62s)]
*  deal. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3629.7s)]
*  I come from India where my family was very involved in the independence movement. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3630.7s)]
*  We've been looking at democracy for a long time. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3635.4199999999996s)]
*  The Indian Constitution, by the way, was the most advanced constitution in the world for [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3637.8999999999996s)]
*  several decades because it was the newest. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3641.8199999999997s)]
*  It could learn from some of the mistakes in the US and other constitutions. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3644.8199999999997s)]
*  Constitution is like the software that runs a country. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3649.98s)]
*  You need to be able to update it now. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3651.8999999999996s)]
*  This is where I have a huge beef with the originalists in the US. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3653.46s)]
*  If you're not updating your software, you're pretty much out of date pretty quickly, which [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3657.9s)]
*  is kind of where we are in certain ways. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3660.9s)]
*  All right, let me just give you the high level. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3662.66s)]
*  About 10 years ago, we were looking at this problem, you know, my hobby and metaphysics [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3665.2599999999998s)]
*  and philosophy and so on. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3669.18s)]
*  A fellow called Malcolm Pollock and I came up with an analogy which we called ice water [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3670.46s)]
*  steam. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3675.02s)]
*  Okay? [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3676.02s)]
*  So imagine you have ice where the molecules are kind of very cold. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3677.02s)]
*  They don't move very far or very fast. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3680.18s)]
*  They hold their shape, right? [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3681.62s)]
*  Very low energy in the system. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3683.02s)]
*  Then you add heat or energy in the system. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3684.66s)]
*  Then you get the liquid. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3686.7799999999997s)]
*  Now it can expand to the boundaries of the container. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3687.7799999999997s)]
*  It's more active, more agitation of molecules, et cetera, et cetera, but still reasonably [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3690.38s)]
*  slow. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3695.1s)]
*  You add more energy and you get steam, which burns you, is hard to contain. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3696.1s)]
*  The molecules are highly active, right? [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3699.98s)]
*  And we went through a whole kind of series of looking at human endeavor in different [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3702.9s)]
*  ways. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3707.54s)]
*  Take messaging. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3708.54s)]
*  We used to send smoke signals or the Pony Express or homing pigeons. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3709.72s)]
*  Very local, very slow. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3714.72s)]
*  It was the ice state. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3716.6s)]
*  Nothing moved very far or very fast. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3718.52s)]
*  Then you went to postal mail, which was the liquid state. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3720.48s)]
*  You could send messages around the world. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3722.64s)]
*  It just took a long time and it went to the boundaries of the container. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3724.8399999999997s)]
*  Then we digitized everything and now we have tweets and we've totally vaporized our messaging [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3728.2s)]
*  structures, right? [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3735.2s)]
*  Take money. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3736.8799999999997s)]
*  We used to trade camels and goats. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3737.8799999999997s)]
*  There were seashells. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3739.0s)]
*  Again, very local, very slow. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3740.0s)]
*  Then we came up with currencies and letters of credit. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3741.24s)]
*  Then we floated our currencies, even more perfect for the analogy. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3744.08s)]
*  Then we went to Bitcoin and digital currencies and crypto and now we vaporized and digitized [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3747.56s)]
*  things. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3753.0s)]
*  Same thing with human organization. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3754.0s)]
*  We used to have clans or tribes that didn't move very far, very fast. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3755.68s)]
*  Then we moved to, say, nation states and multinational corporations. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3759.48s)]
*  Now we have Facebook groups and online TikTok communities, right? [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3763.84s)]
*  We vaporized that. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3767.7599999999998s)]
*  The challenge is, and this came up when looking at the Arab Spring or the Occupy Wall Street [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3768.7599999999998s)]
*  movement, lots of hot air, but nothing stable formed out of it. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3773.44s)]
*  The challenge is in a vapor state, stable structures don't form. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3777.2000000000003s)]
*  As we vaporize and add more and more technology to different domains like money and democracy, [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3782.76s)]
*  et cetera, how do we get stable structures? [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3787.96s)]
*  In the lack of that stable structure, we go back to the old way, which is what's happening [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3790.68s)]
*  in various parts of the world. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3794.92s)]
*  That's just a broad metaphor for what's happening in the world. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3796.36s)]
*  I think an intellectual challenge is to think about what's the equivalent of a fridge that [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3799.92s)]
*  can cool things down. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3805.28s)]
*  We actually use the ideal gas law as a metaphor for this, but we don't need to get into that [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3808.88s)]
*  right now. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3812.7200000000003s)]
*  If I apply that pattern to democracy, we've been running democracies at a nation state [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3814.52s)]
*  level for the last few hundred years. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3820.6800000000003s)]
*  The problem is nation states, in my opinion, they're a wrong container. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3823.16s)]
*  They're too big. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3826.16s)]
*  For example, nation states cancels climate change. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3827.28s)]
*  I agree with you. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3830.32s)]
*  The fact that our entire democratic process came down to four states. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3831.32s)]
*  Ridiculous. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3837.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3838.2400000000002s)]
*  Ridiculous. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3839.2400000000002s)]
*  Or you take India, where I'm from. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3840.2400000000002s)]
*  It's 20 different languages and cultures trying to be one country. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3841.2400000000002s)]
*  It makes no sense. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3844.52s)]
*  What you need to do is granularize. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3847.6800000000003s)]
*  Paul Safar, I remember getting on stage at Singularity University and said the future [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3849.88s)]
*  of the world is not nation states, it's city states. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3853.44s)]
*  Actually, you look at Trump or Brexit, it's not left versus right, it's urban versus rural. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3857.48s)]
*  You can see that in the map from last night. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3862.2000000000003s)]
*  It's very clear to you, right? [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3864.88s)]
*  Brexit was 100% London versus the rest of the country. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3866.56s)]
*  That's the tension that's playing out in the world. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3869.88s)]
*  If you have, for example, now in the future, let's say 10 years into the future, a city [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3872.12s)]
*  that has vertical farming, satellite internet, solar energy and small nuclear, water extraction [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3877.0s)]
*  using the water abundance prize winner, you don't need a country. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3885.12s)]
*  You don't need the infrastructure for a country. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3889.0s)]
*  Therefore, I think we're going to devolve to small community self-determining their [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3891.8s)]
*  future and working out their own structures and then operating in a networked environment [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3896.36s)]
*  in a much more powerful way. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3901.64s)]
*  In a world of abundance, see, nation states are really great for scarcity. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3903.28s)]
*  They're terrible for abundance. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3908.92s)]
*  There's a whole bunch of things, different dimensions of looking at this. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3910.4s)]
*  Here's the question. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3914.52s)]
*  I think the old saying that governments suck except we've got the best version of what's [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3916.52s)]
*  available today. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3925.68s)]
*  Democracy is the worst form of government except for everything else. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3926.68s)]
*  Yes, got it. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3930.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3931.16s)]
*  The question becomes there are better versions. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3932.16s)]
*  There are better versions that are easy to describe. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3935.28s)]
*  We have a representative government today versus we don't have a direct democracy. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3939.4s)]
*  Yes. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3943.68s)]
*  That whole situation is important. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3944.68s)]
*  Can I just pause you just for a second? [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3946.68s)]
*  The reason we have a representative government today. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3948.52s)]
*  It started 250 years ago. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3951.4s)]
*  Well, at the time, information was scarce. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3953.2s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3956.4s)]
*  And very slowly. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3957.4s)]
*  That's right. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3958.4s)]
*  So if you were in DC, you literally had no idea what was happening in California because [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3959.4s)]
*  the speed of a horse was as fast you could find out. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3963.32s)]
*  So we had a representative. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3965.64s)]
*  Hey, let me just finish my point. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3967.12s)]
*  We had a representative come across the country and say, here's why people are thinking this [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3968.44s)]
*  is why we have represented. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3972.44s)]
*  But in a world of this digital wave, an abundance of information and representative government [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3973.44s)]
*  doesn't apply. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3978.16s)]
*  And so we have to really fundamentally rethink our structures from the bottom up. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3979.16s)]
*  So the question becomes, is there any way to do this other than a revolution? [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3983.36s)]
*  Other than a starting from a clean sheet of paper? [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3989.44s)]
*  I mean, the reality is governments and there is a few different ways. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3994.16s)]
*  These are finished, my turn, don't like giving up power. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=3999.9199999999996s)]
*  And they have armies and they like them. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4003.12s)]
*  They do. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4006.72s)]
*  And they put laws in the books to protect themselves and they buy appropriate regulatory [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4008.12s)]
*  leaders to protect themselves. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4013.68s)]
*  And there's better ways. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4016.24s)]
*  So in the analogy that you and I talk about a lot, which is that every company will eventually, [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4019.52s)]
*  unless they disrupt themselves, be disrupted by someone else. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4026.28s)]
*  The question becomes, where will the disruption come from for the future of democracy? [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4030.7200000000003s)]
*  Is it virtual governments? [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4036.8s)]
*  Is it network state? [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4038.6800000000003s)]
*  Another topic I want to hit on at abundance this year is what biology has talked about [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4040.8s)]
*  as the network state. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4045.6800000000003s)]
*  Where it doesn't matter physiologically where you live. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4047.4s)]
*  I have you're one of my peep, someone of yours. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4050.88s)]
*  That's right. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4054.2400000000002s)]
*  I think so. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4055.52s)]
*  I disagree with the I agree with 80% of what biology talks in the network state. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4056.52s)]
*  A large global community like abundance or Ted or EXO has a core set of principles and [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4061.68s)]
*  values with its own cryptocurrency can operate as a country in a very easy way and operate [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4067.28s)]
*  as a network state. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4072.76s)]
*  But at some point you need the physical thing. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4074.56s)]
*  And the way I disagree is when in the last bit where he says all you have to do is get [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4076.8s)]
*  validation from an existing government and recognition from an existing government, which [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4082.32s)]
*  is that, wait a minute, that's just not going to happen in an easy way. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4088.28s)]
*  And we have that already today. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4093.0s)]
*  We have a lot of digital nomads that arbitrage the Puerto Rico income tax versus the Portugal [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4094.36s)]
*  income tax versus Bali. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4100.64s)]
*  And they're moving around depending on whether regulatory regime is the friendliest. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4102.28s)]
*  I think that's what's going to happen unless you have an authoritarian country that doesn't [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4106.08s)]
*  let you leave. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4110.4400000000005s)]
*  And that will actually solve a lot of the problems in that. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4111.44s)]
*  So I do agree with much of what the network state talks about. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4113.919999999999s)]
*  Where I think things can be easy is a couple of areas that would be so easy to solve in [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4118.639999999999s)]
*  federal government. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4123.879999999999s)]
*  One is give preference to local laws rather than federal laws. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4125.12s)]
*  And that's where states' rights actually become really interesting, down to city rights. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4131.04s)]
*  Miami is a very, very different place than rural Florida. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4135.48s)]
*  So even state doesn't really cut it. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4138.9s)]
*  You have to go down to the city and local community level so that people have their [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4141.04s)]
*  own value system and the laws should represent them. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4145.36s)]
*  The second is every time you pass a law at the federal level, you should have an end [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4150.0s)]
*  date to that law. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4154.6s)]
*  And they do this in Germany and they do this in a few places, very powerful. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4157.34s)]
*  And or take a law off the books. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4160.4s)]
*  Yeah, every time you have one, you have to take five off the books because we're over-regulated [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4162.4s)]
*  so much. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4166.36s)]
*  This may be the most optimistic area I'm thinking about if Elon gets in charge of a government [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4167.68s)]
*  deregulation department. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4172.160000000001s)]
*  It's going to be fantastic. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4174.52s)]
*  He's just going to go because his first principle thinking is going to come to ver and go, why [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4175.52s)]
*  do you have to have a barrel of hay in the back of your London cab because it was there [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4182.320000000001s)]
*  to feed the horse 100 years ago? [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4186.6s)]
*  Are you nuts? [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4188.64s)]
*  Just get rid of that crap. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4189.64s)]
*  This is going to be the most extraordinary reality TV show ever. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4190.64s)]
*  Yes. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4195.56s)]
*  I think the Department of Government Efficiency. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4197.04s)]
*  And then the last point around kind of what we could do now is liquid democracy where [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4200.68s)]
*  you don't, you're voting not based on a geography or based on ideas. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4205.240000000001s)]
*  Like, you've got so much advanced thinking and say, biotech, I'd rather give you my vote [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4209.6s)]
*  on that topic. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4213.84s)]
*  So you make category votes and say, for this, anything to do with this, I'll go with Lawrence [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4215.320000000001s)]
*  Lessig on digital rights. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4219.820000000001s)]
*  I'll go with Peter on ethics of biotech. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4221.120000000001s)]
*  I'll go with Hank Greely of Stanford on anything to do with biotech ethics, et cetera. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4223.5199999999995s)]
*  And so you can just kind of use a proxy. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4227.799999999999s)]
*  I thought you gave biotech ethics to me. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4229.759999999999s)]
*  I just, I double voted. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4231.5599999999995s)]
*  That is a beautiful thing, right? [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4235.5599999999995s)]
*  What right do I have to vote on women's reproductive rights when I'm a guy? [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4237.759999999999s)]
*  Leave it to the women. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4245.5599999999995s)]
*  For God's sake, leave it to the women. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4246.5599999999995s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4248.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4249.48s)]
*  It's quite right. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4250.48s)]
*  So, buddy, listen, I want to wrap this WTF Just Happened in Tech session by saying we're [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4251.48s)]
*  in for a lot of technical acceleration, I think. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4261.44s)]
*  And a lot of that acceleration in AI is going to be independent of the government. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4268.32s)]
*  It's going to be happening on a sort of a corporate level. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4274.92s)]
*  I do think the idea of AI becoming an infrastructure play, right? [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4282.28s)]
*  One of the things that I took away from meeting a lot of government leaders in Saudi is every [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4288.88s)]
*  single government, every government is like, how do we get us some? [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4297.28s)]
*  How do we get ourselves a national large language model? [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4303.2s)]
*  How do we get ourselves a compute infrastructure? [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4306.44s)]
*  And how do we provide it to our entrepreneurs, our business owners, our students? [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4310.92s)]
*  And it will fundamentally become an infrastructure play, just like telephony, just like electricity, [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4318.5199999999995s)]
*  just like oxygen. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4325.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4326.8s)]
*  Can I tell you a crazy segue here? [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4327.8s)]
*  On topic, though. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4331.92s)]
*  You know, it would be the simplest thing in the world to take all of our legal law structures [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4334.32s)]
*  and digitize them and have them AI enabled. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4338.88s)]
*  It turns out there's certain laws in various states in the US that are not public and you're [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4343.08s)]
*  not allowed to know the law. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4347.76s)]
*  What? [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4349.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4350.4s)]
*  No. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4351.4s)]
*  So there's been a whole movement. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4352.4s)]
*  No, it's true. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4353.4s)]
*  Because they've been written by... [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4355.24s)]
*  How do you know if you're not allowed to know? [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4356.24s)]
*  Well, because lobbyists have uncovered that lobbyists have written the laws. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4358.0s)]
*  And they've kind of made it so they're somewhat... [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4360.96s)]
*  Probably nobody knows about them. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4363.12s)]
*  It's really nuts. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4364.64s)]
*  So there's a huge effort to be just to digitize the damn law and get everything into one place [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4365.64s)]
*  would be just a massive thing. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4370.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4373.08s)]
*  All I can say... [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4374.08s)]
*  The world is very weird, right? [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4375.08s)]
*  Like, this is where I find the overreach of government to be unacceptable, where you're [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4377.08s)]
*  blocking UBI experiments, explicitly blocking... [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4382.16s)]
*  That just blows my mind. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4386.4s)]
*  There were things like this where certain legal structures are not allowed to be public [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4387.48s)]
*  because they're so toxic that nobody wants them out there. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4391.12s)]
*  So that's the kind of stuff where I think will shine the light. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4396.04s)]
*  Are you going to change your investment strategies at all, given this administration? [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4400.12s)]
*  Great question. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4407.48s)]
*  Probably not much because I'm so pro-Bitcoin, it could be hard to go more within reasonum. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4411.44s)]
*  So I'm way more excited about the future of crypto now than I would have been, although [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4422.5599999999995s)]
*  in the last six months, the Harris-Biden administration kind of hobbled the SEC anyway around crypto [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4428.839999999999s)]
*  as a response. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4436.32s)]
*  But I think this will go another step further. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4437.48s)]
*  How about you? [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4439.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm just so deep on tech and crypto and Bitcoin specifically that I don't think I can be any [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4442.16s)]
*  deeper. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4450.5599999999995s)]
*  And I'm so overweighted on entrepreneurial startups as well. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4451.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, the broad commentary is that technology has been a major driver of progress since [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4457.04s)]
*  the beginning of time for humanity. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4461.759999999999s)]
*  And it might be the only major driver of progress, right? [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4463.48s)]
*  Now with a dozen technologies moving exponentially, the upside potential is huge. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4467.12s)]
*  And therefore, betting on that is an obvious thing to do at a macro level. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4472.08s)]
*  Yeah, if you just look at the growth of the fang stocks, it accounts for the majority [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4475.4400000000005s)]
*  of our nation's capital gains. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4485.8s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4489.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4490.16s)]
*  I mean, it's insane. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4491.16s)]
*  I'm curious about what other crypto currencies are you going to continue to play? [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4492.32s)]
*  I mean, I remember back when crypto peaked in the late 20 teens, everybody was playing [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4498.84s)]
*  in what has euphemistically be called the shitcoins. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4504.8s)]
*  Is there a rationale for effort? [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4511.76s)]
*  Yeah, I believe there is just like we have multiple brands of databases, each optimized [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4517.72s)]
*  for various things. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4524.32s)]
*  I think different brands and different styles of crypto, for example, a crypto or blockchain [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4525.76s)]
*  based thing that was optimized for land titles and property rights would be a different animal [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4531.8s)]
*  and hyper focused on that particular domain would be very, very highly utilitarian for [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4537.16s)]
*  that vertical in that use case, right? [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4542.88s)]
*  It would be very, very different. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4545.84s)]
*  I was buying candy using crypto. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4546.84s)]
*  And so I think you'll end up with a spectrum of those. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4549.56s)]
*  And we see this in the real world, right? [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4552.76s)]
*  You see gold and then you see deposit accounts and CDAs and so on, CDs and bonds. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4554.320000000001s)]
*  And then as you get more and more liquid towards the end in smaller transactions, say credit [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4562.320000000001s)]
*  card transactions, they're very flighty and minor. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4566.76s)]
*  You can have much easier level of fraud, but the use case is different across that spectrum. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4570.16s)]
*  And I think the same thing will happen with crypto where something like Bitcoin will be [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4575.16s)]
*  used as the store of value. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4578.24s)]
*  You'll have something else like based on the Lightning Network or something similar for [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4580.48s)]
*  means of exchange and to stabilize value so that if Bitcoin goes up and down, you don't [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4584.2s)]
*  kind of go crazy on your value of some micro transaction that you're doing. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4589.36s)]
*  All the way to the very frivolous little things where using loyalty points for some application. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4594.92s)]
*  I think you'll get the broader spectrum. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4600.16s)]
*  But some of the applications we're seeing are unbelievable. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4602.92s)]
*  I just came across one where there's a problem in banking called settlements. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4605.96s)]
*  So if I owe you $800 and you owe Lily $600 and she owes me $400, we can actually settle [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4611.92s)]
*  $400 without moving any money. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4618.4s)]
*  And so if we can operate that kind of a system, which would operate at a local city level, [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4621.72s)]
*  it turns out you could drop the cost of capital by about 50%, which is huge for businesses [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4626.4400000000005s)]
*  and so on. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4631.68s)]
*  Stuff like that can be brought online that hasn't been able to be done because the banks [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4632.92s)]
*  always want every transaction going through them because they tax it all. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4635.96s)]
*  And so now we can kind of unwind some of that several hundred year old architecture that [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4640.52s)]
*  should be updated. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4646.240000000001s)]
*  All right. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4647.240000000001s)]
*  One last subject here, buddy. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4648.240000000001s)]
*  So Bitcoin at this moment is at $76,000. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4649.88s)]
*  It's an all time high as we're recording this. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4653.08s)]
*  I wish I could go back to myself and put a mortgage on the house a couple years ago, [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4655.96s)]
*  but no. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4662.56s)]
*  Here's the question. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4663.56s)]
*  Quantum computers. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4666.88s)]
*  There's a lot of buzz coming out of China right now about being able to break all of [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4667.88s)]
*  the encryption codes. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4672.8s)]
*  I used to believe that no, that's not going to happen. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4676.160000000001s)]
*  We're going to have quantum encryption protecting us against quantum computers. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4679.96s)]
*  And I'm hearing maybe not. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4685.96s)]
*  What are you hearing? [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4689.68s)]
*  When I see Satoshi's $60 billion Bitcoin wallet hacked, then I'll start to worry. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4691.24s)]
*  Well, then it's all over. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4698.719999999999s)]
*  The point is if you can't hack that wallet, you're long ways away. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4700.679999999999s)]
*  Now, I also do agree with your point, which is that you will have quantum encryption. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4703.88s)]
*  Hacking is always a... [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4712.5199999999995s)]
*  Cyber security is always an arms race. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4713.639999999999s)]
*  The bad guys find some mechanism and then we kind of solve that problem. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4715.76s)]
*  We just go through that, just the cycles. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4720.5599999999995s)]
*  Somebody breaks quantum, that would be one thing, but you still have to solve the distributed [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4722.719999999999s)]
*  ledger problem, which is really the Byzantine generals problem, which is hard to break. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4726.08s)]
*  And so you might solve the encryption, but it doesn't solve the distributed ledger aspect, [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4731.839999999999s)]
*  which is what makes it powerful. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4735.92s)]
*  A $60 billion X prize for... [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4737.4s)]
*  Oh, God, you're such a natural hacker. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4741.12s)]
*  Yeah, amazing. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4746.5199999999995s)]
*  All right, buddy. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4747.96s)]
*  I'm excited to see you this weekend. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4749.48s)]
*  Yes, it's going to be a fun time. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4751.2s)]
*  It's going to be fun. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4753.919999999999s)]
*  All right, everybody. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4754.919999999999s)]
*  Thank you for joining us for this month's episode of WTF Just Happened in Tech. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4755.919999999999s)]
*  Well, what just happened in tech is a new administration. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4760.5599999999995s)]
*  And I'm so curious, is Elon going to really jump into the Department of Government Efficiency? [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4764.28s)]
*  The guy is running five companies right now and has like 11 kids. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4772.04s)]
*  Is he going to do that as well? [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4776.08s)]
*  I mean, I'm just, you know, listen, I know we both do a lot. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4778.2s)]
*  How the hell does he do all that he does? [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4782.5199999999995s)]
*  I keep on asking him. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4785.84s)]
*  He doesn't give me an answer. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4786.84s)]
*  I'm just trying to understand. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4788.32s)]
*  I don't think he knows. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4789.32s)]
*  I think he's just so driven. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4790.32s)]
*  This goes back to the MTP, right? [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4792.5599999999995s)]
*  He's so driven by his massive transformative purposes, it keeps the engine going. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4794.28s)]
*  And God bless. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4799.96s)]
*  I mean, we've not talked about this, but the side of that rocket landing back and getting [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4800.96s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4805.68s)]
*  Yes. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4806.68s)]
*  Darshan five. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4807.68s)]
*  The most incredibly amazing things that I think has been seen in humanity. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4808.68s)]
*  The biggest rocket in history. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4811.6s)]
*  It's the greatest engineering feat of, if not just this decade, multiple decades. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4812.6s)]
*  So if he can take that kind of creative energy and focus his teams on government deregulation, [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4818.68s)]
*  lots of interesting things possible. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4824.84s)]
*  Can you fire government employees that easily? [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4826.200000000001s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4828.96s)]
*  No, you can't. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4829.96s)]
*  You can't. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4830.96s)]
*  They're like unions and stuff. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4831.96s)]
*  This is the classic problem in all society. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4832.96s)]
*  Once you get a structure in place, you put a motor on yourself, whether it's a medical [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4835.56s)]
*  establishment saying you must have a doctor. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4839.44s)]
*  A few years ago, they passed a law in Texas saying telemedicine was illegal because you [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4841.8s)]
*  had to see your doctor if I had a little wart on my skin. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4847.32s)]
*  I mean, it's just the most unbelievable protectionism that goes on at all sorts of societal levels. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4850.28s)]
*  Government is just not, is one of those things that protects itself first because it can. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4856.0s)]
*  Vene actually gave me one of the best definitions of government I ever came across. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4860.96s)]
*  He said government is an entity that can pardon its own crimes. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4866.92s)]
*  So they steal from you and they call that tax. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4871.4s)]
*  They put you in jail where they kidnap you. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4874.0s)]
*  They call that prison. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4876.4400000000005s)]
*  And so it pardons its own crimes. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4878.16s)]
*  And that is able to do that because of the place that it's in. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4880.4800000000005s)]
*  And I think that's the part that needs to be undone because there's so many structures [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4883.24s)]
*  that stop progress by calcifying old thinking, teachers unions, for example, that we need [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4889.5s)]
*  to find mechanisms to break that up and break up what I call the immune system problem. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4897.58s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4901.54s)]
*  Okay, so no more C corporations next time I'm starting a government or religion. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4903.02s)]
*  I want to experiment a little bit more than that. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4907.7s)]
*  Yes. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4910.3s)]
*  All right, buddy. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4911.3s)]
*  A pleasure as always. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4912.3s)]
*  Thank you for your time. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4913.3s)]
*  I hope you would be my prophet anytime, Peter. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4914.3s)]
*  And you are, I think, the tech prophet for many people. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4916.98s)]
*  So hats off. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0_fIlAuJQ&t=4919.419999999999s)]
