**Moonshots - Peter Diamandis:** [May 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8)
*  Welcome to moonshots in our episode called WTF just happened in tech this week with myself and Salim Ismail [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=0.0s)]
*  We're gonna be talking about the fact that Florida banned lab-grown meats and why it should not [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=5.82s)]
*  We're speaking about alpha-fold 3 that's gonna be able to predict how all the molecules in your body interact [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=10.96s)]
*  This is about simulating life itself [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=16.82s)]
*  We're gonna dive beyond that into what's going on with AI and the elections all the humanoid robots coming online the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=19.52s)]
*  Explosion in China will talk about Elon's plans for robo taxis and the Bitcoin having alright [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=27.16s)]
*  Let's jump in you know [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=33.96s)]
*  I've been having amazing conversations like these for years [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=35.54s)]
*  And it's a joy for me to share it with you, and if you enjoyed as well [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=39.14s)]

*  Claude 3 hit a hundred and one IQ [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=48.0s)]
*  This could get interesting over our next period of time [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=51.74s)]
*  You can spend a couple hours and get so much personalized education. It's insane [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=55.620000000000005s)]
*  We're gonna see just the biggest explosion of AI's finding these niche things that we've overlooked in finding unbelievable stuff [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=61.42s)]
*  Everybody welcome to moonshots welcome to our episode WTF just happened in tech this week with myself and Salim Ismail [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=72.6s)]
*  I'm Peter de Amanda Salim good to see you, buddy [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=79.88s)]
*  Good to be here. Yeah a lot happening every week. I think we're gonna have to start to do this [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=83.24s)]
*  What happened in tech like on a daily basis that an hourly basis and then just stay on all the time? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=88.8s)]
*  It's the links that were kind of sending each other is growing very fast every day. It's crazy alright [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=95.52s)]
*  Let's start with this one this one your is yours you brought this up at the XPRIZE board meeting [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=101.4s)]
*  You know I understand that you left Florida for you know, New York, New Jersey [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=106.16000000000001s)]
*  Is this the reason because you couldn't have lab-grown meat? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=110.64s)]
*  So no, so what's the story here? What's the story here? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=114.56s)]
*  The story here is that DeSantis kowtowing to the lobbyists of the meat world [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=118.04s)]
*  You know he talks about freedom and yet he's curtailing freedoms, and this is the the beef [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  I have with them pun intended there and sounds fishy to me [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=130.98000000000002s)]
*  So stopping lab-grown meat is just [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=135.0s)]
*  Absolutely killing innovation and really bad for the planet and this this is wrong. It's so many levels [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  It's hard to even start talking about it [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=144.12s)]
*  I was just so angry about this the thing that I would love to do is do a lab-grown meat demo and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=146.32000000000002s)]
*  taste test etc in Miami and stick it to these idiots. Yeah, you know we're running right now a [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  Large XPRIZE that's funded in part by Tony Robbins and in part. Yeah the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=161.88s)]
*  lives in Florida in part by the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=167.56s)]
*  Abu Dhabi government and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=171.12s)]
*  It's really to develop lab-grown meat [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=172.92s)]
*  It's also called stem cell grown meat better yet called cultured meat and this is instead of growing the entire cow [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=175.76s)]
*  Instead of growing the entire pig or chicken [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=182.56s)]
*  What if we just grow the muscle and give it a chicken fillet? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=185.16s)]
*  a tuna fillet, you know a wagyu beef [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=190.92s)]
*  and [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=194.6s)]
*  imagine if the meat were [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=195.79999999999998s)]
*  Cheaper taste better and healthier for you. So the tuna you get has zero mercury in it [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=198.0s)]
*  Right. I mean my arsenic levels [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=203.96s)]
*  I just tech attested are high and I'm being told it's because of the chicken I eat [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=206.44s)]
*  It's like really I'm eating arsenic when I have you know chicken breast. That's insane [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=211.04s)]
*  Yes, because of all the feed they're giving all of these animals is is not normal and natural and so it's hormone laced and [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=216.56s)]
*  Olystros of trace chemicals are getting into them. It's a it's it's a mess on [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=224.68s)]
*  This and to to ban it is just such a stupid thing to do it. It drives me crazy dare [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=229.24s)]
*  I say that he's chicken [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=234.28s)]
*  All right, let's go this might be a joke about all this is when I get asked about the office [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=237.56s)]
*  I go, you know, the McDonald's Big Mac has been 3d printed for decades. Yeah feel [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=241.44s)]
*  That way let's talk about speed. So this popped up in the news this week, Japan developed 6g [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=246.44s)]
*  and [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=253.4s)]
*  I've been tracking this and you know those of you who are on the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=254.96s)]
*  typical decent service today you're on 5g and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=260.24s)]
*  The g stands for generation and there was a one generation phone two three four generation [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=263.44s)]
*  4g was [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=269.72s)]
*  You know a hundred times faster than 3g [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=271.6s)]
*  5g a hundred times faster than 4g and now 6g is [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=274.20000000000005s)]
*  They're saying 20 times faster than 5g. I feel a little bit cheated by that [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=279.0s)]
*  But you know still 20 times is pretty good [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=282.92s)]
*  And all of a sudden, you know, you have literally all the information you could possibly want suck down [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=285.48s)]
*  You know gigabits per second into your phone. Yeah, I felt cheated by 5g because they labeled it 5g [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=293.48s)]
*  But it was never really 5g [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=300.04s)]
*  What was it there was a whole bunch of marketing crap and they didn't build the infrastructure to go along with it [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=301.52000000000004s)]
*  But this seems truly promising and a real step change in a real breakthrough. So I'm very excited by this [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=306.16s)]
*  All right. Let's talk about AI our favorite subject because it is changing the world [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  And there's a lot happening [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=318.08000000000004s)]
*  This is by far my favorite story of the week. I actually tweeted out [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=320.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm gonna still say tweet. I'm sorry, Ilan [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=325.2s)]
*  I tweeted out to my followers like what were the most important stories of the week? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=327.56s)]
*  This one came in and I agree I was at the breakthrough awards here in LA. It's funded by [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=332.44s)]
*  by Yuri Milner and Mark [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=340.15999999999997s)]
*  From [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=343.76s)]
*  X Facebook shall we call it mark for Metta? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=345.15999999999997s)]
*  And and and Sergey and a few others and they give out awards not like the X prize for prospective [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=348.32000000000005s)]
*  you know something that needs to be achieved but for like breakthroughs that occurred in the past and [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=355.28000000000003s)]
*  Demis and John jumper got a award for alpha fold alpha fold was an AI deep learning [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=360.56s)]
*  Network that was able to predict from an amino acid sequence. How does a protein fold and it was a big deal [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=367.96000000000004s)]
*  Since I was in medical school, this has been the [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=374.12s)]
*  Supercomputing problem. Can you predict how a protein would fold really hard and [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=377.48s)]
*  What's alpha fold 3? I'm gonna read the headline here alpha fold 3 predicts the structure and interactions of all of life molecules [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=383.92s)]
*  so imagine this not just like how a protein folds, but how that protein interacts with a [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=391.40000000000003s)]
*  Lipid or carbohydrate or with a DNA molecule and so it's literally [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=398.76s)]
*  Simulating how these molecules interact with each other and it's extraordinary [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=406.24s)]
*  Do you do you feel how big this is? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=413.32s)]
*  I think this is huge because this allows us to fully simulate like an organ in software [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=415.32s)]
*  Right, and that's amazing for testing plus simulate up plus illness tracking [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=421.40000000000003s)]
*  Illness tracking diagnoses therapies, etc full digital twin. I mean, this is gonna be amazing exactly [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=427.08000000000004s)]
*  So given your DNA we're gonna first simulate one of a Salim Ismail liver cell or skin cell or [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=433.8s)]
*  Brain cell which would be very very interesting. I would say [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=441.76s)]
*  Well, I lived in Ireland for a year. So my liver is always been a bit [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=445.56s)]
*  So it'd be really great better than your brain [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=450.48s)]
*  My liver and fix it somehow better than your brain being damaged [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=453.16s)]
*  but we're gonna be able to go from your DNA to simulating a cell and then [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=455.96s)]
*  once we simulate a cell we can then simulate a tissue and [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=460.8s)]
*  Then once we're simulating a tissue we can simulate an organ and then the whole organism and the thing [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=464.52s)]
*  I like to tell tell people just to understand [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=470.34s)]
*  You know when SpaceX launched the Dragon capsule to the space station for the very first time it worked perfectly [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=473.36s)]
*  And the reason it worked perfectly was it had flown probably millions of times in simulation and [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=479.76s)]
*  When it got up there, they had modeled it beautifully and it was you know, it worked like it predicted [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=486.72s)]
*  Imagine if now when you're given a drug we know it's gonna work for you. Do you have any idea? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=494.48s)]
*  How what percentage of drugs? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=501.0s)]
*  That you are prescribed actually work for you [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=504.0s)]
*  Like no, so the FDA approves drugs that work, you know [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=511.15999999999997s)]
*  Typically for like 20 or 30 percent of the people that they're given to it's a minority of the cases that it's gonna work for you [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=515.88s)]
*  And then because most drugs historically have never been tested in women because it's like too [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=523.92s)]
*  Inconvenient by the way, I think it's like Women's Health Day today. So I'll mention [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=529.72s)]
*  this [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=533.64s)]
*  That that when drugs get taken off the market it's because oh it didn't work in half half the world's population [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=535.68s)]
*  Surprise surprise, but this is gonna be in silico medicine. This is actually predicting a drug works perfectly for you [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=542.88s)]
*  I love this huge kudos to the team of DeepMind [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=549.72s)]
*  Alpha Fold 3 very soon [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=554.16s)]
*  Alpha cell one or something like that. Yeah, so in practical terms [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=557.2s)]
*  Tell me if I'm getting this right if you're a pharma company and you're trying to test a drug [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=561.96s)]
*  You can now run it against these simulations and have a really high reliability and cut out a lot of crap before you get to [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=567.0s)]
*  human trials making the human trials more of a [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=573.5600000000001s)]
*  An obvious thing and a stepping stone rather than a big test and that'll drop radically the cost of drug development [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=578.24s)]
*  Will I mean imagine the way it's done today you go into the Amazon [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=585.12s)]
*  Rainforest and say hey look at that plant over there. I don't think anybody's ever, you know smashed that one up [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=590.04s)]
*  let's see if it has any molecules of interest to humans and you go through this long process of [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=595.1999999999999s)]
*  evaluating them in like in like back, you know in yeast and worms in mice and [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=601.0s)]
*  anyway, it's a long expensive process and then [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=607.0799999999999s)]
*  Then you have to prove it does no harm and then you have to prove it does do some good not a hundred percent of [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=610.6s)]
*  The time so this can be even a little bit better than you said because we can say not only does it work [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=615.5600000000001s)]
*  It works for my exact [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=621.8000000000001s)]
*  Genetics very cool, right? Very huge huge [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=624.6800000000001s)]
*  So now this Daniel Kraft talks about the personalization of medicine medicine and now we can get it right there, you know [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=627.6800000000001s)]
*  one of the big things that I've enjoyed watching in [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=634.72s)]
*  On X has been the demos of Sora. Let's play this demo. I'm curious what you think check this out [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=638.12s)]
*  So here's a person walking and you're able to turn that person into a woman an old man a robot and [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=646.0s)]
*  So the actor, you know plays a simple role and then you can turn it into anyone I assume mountain on you know [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=653.0400000000001s)]
*  Monroe or you know [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=661.48s)]
*  Gregory Peck [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=663.48s)]
*  What do you think of this? Um [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=664.8000000000001s)]
*  You know, I'm kind of like eh [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=667.48s)]
*  really I [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=670.0400000000001s)]
*  Think it it's a it's a great incremental achievement, but there's nothing breakthrough the ability to swap out things is always there [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=671.7600000000001s)]
*  It's just doing it better faster [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=678.84s)]
*  So I didn't how fast how fast we become jaded at stuff. That was a miracle. I know I know [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=680.8800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, have we talked about the Wi-Fi on a plane? Yes, Lucy K does. Yeah, it's like that [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=687.6s)]
*  Yeah, right. We normalize and this is I think [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=694.12s)]
*  Broader comment or an AGI that's really important [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=697.08s)]
*  We pass a Turing test normalize it will pass a GI at some point and normalize it within minutes [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=699.84s)]
*  Yeah, I think Sam Altman said that [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=705.72s)]
*  Very nicely said people were like, oh my god [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=707.8000000000001s)]
*  GP chat GPT is crazy and then it's like and then a month later like man, it's slow [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=711.08s)]
*  You know, it's like he's like that's right [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=716.6s)]
*  So let's see what we got next on our [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=719.76s)]
*  What's going on in the world scenario here? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=722.5600000000001s)]
*  Interesting [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=725.96s)]
*  Talk about this one pal. So have you seen this trailer? I'm not [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=728.08s)]
*  It's terrible. It's really cringe-worthy [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=732.76s)]
*  It's it's they've got a ways to go before they cross, you know, what we would call the uncanny valley [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=736.28s)]
*  And the lines are kind of stilted whatever. However, it's important to note that this will double every [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=742.0s)]
*  Month or two in its capability and its fidelity and the joke-telling so this could get interesting over [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=748.2s)]
*  Next up here at a time. I [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=754.7199999999999s)]
*  Again kind of don't think it's that big of a deal [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=757.64s)]
*  But it's certainly huge that you can have an AI driven completely driven [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=760.12s)]
*  of a script [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=766.2399999999999s)]
*  Acting character development etc all in one which is really kind of a pretty big deal. You know what I find interesting is [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=767.9599999999999s)]
*  the [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=776.16s)]
*  Means by you know a film is created today is someone writes a film a group of executives read it [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=777.28s)]
*  They attach stars to it and they green light it and if they have the right [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=784.0400000000001s)]
*  Director and if the script is reasonably good [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=789.72s)]
*  they have a high probability but not a certainty that the public's gonna like it and [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=793.12s)]
*  Imagine instead if you could generate, you know, here's a thousand versions of the film [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=799.0s)]
*  right the same basic premise but different actors different and and [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=805.4000000000001s)]
*  You say this is the one when you test it that has the strongest attraction and the best or [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=809.96s)]
*  Frankly, what I really want is I'd like it to know my desires, you know blonde versus brunette [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=816.72s)]
*  You know space versus ocean and create variations of it that I would love [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=822.9200000000001s)]
*  No [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=828.4s)]
*  Anyway, it's coming. I disagree with that. Why? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=829.8000000000001s)]
*  Because you know when you say you go watch Blade Runner 2049. Yeah, right [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=833.72s)]
*  I want to hear I'm watching that because I want to hear what the director is thinking [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=839.64s)]
*  Why did he cast that actor in that role? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=844.08s)]
*  Etc. I wouldn't want that film personalized for my tastes. Huh? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=847.2s)]
*  Well, you don't have to watch my film [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=852.04s)]
*  Yeah, because every lead actor would be a bald middle-aged Indian guy [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=856.28s)]
*  Oh [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=860.44s)]
*  Anyway, whatever is you know, I was just I was just looking for my abundance community [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=864.7600000000001s)]
*  I'm doing a session on converging [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=870.48s)]
*  Converging exponentials and how they're transforming industries and I was researching the founding of YouTube [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=873.44s)]
*  Back in 2005 when Chad Hurley and those guys started and it really was eight different technologies that converged [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=879.2800000000001s)]
*  together to make YouTube happen and [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=886.1600000000001s)]
*  It really [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=888.88s)]
*  Dematerialized demonetized and democratized and really threatened Hollywood a huge amount right? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=890.52s)]
*  with Netflix quickly on its heels [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=897.44s)]
*  and [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=900.36s)]
*  It became it was just the infinity of content producers and I don't know about I don't know about your son [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=901.6800000000001s)]
*  You know, I don't know about Milan but Jett and Dax all they watch is YouTube [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=907.96s)]
*  He lives on it [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=913.88s)]
*  I think I've got to give a huge shout out here to Google because most of the time when you bring in a startup or [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=914.92s)]
*  Require a company or acquire product you kill it and you you you destroy its kind of uniqueness [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=920.76s)]
*  Etc and Google's done almost exactly the opposite [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=927.6s)]
*  Do you know there's a petabyte a day of of content being created on YouTube today? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=932.4s)]
*  It's like 20x any other platform it's the most unbelievable behemoth I had some obscure [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=938.76s)]
*  Hair trimmer and I was trying to figure out something about it [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=945.64s)]
*  I looked it up on YouTube and somebody put up a video of that any instruction used in that little widget there [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=948.36s)]
*  Right, like it's the world's training platform for any obscure [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=953.64s)]
*  Device or gadget or widget of any kind? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=957.4399999999999s)]
*  It's incredible by the way [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=960.12s)]
*  If you're watching this on YouTube and you like the conversation Sleeman I have hit the subscribe button [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=961.16s)]
*  I never say that I'm saying it now. Okay, I do love YouTube. I remember do you know why Google bought YouTube? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=966.2s)]
*  Do you know that Google had Google video going at the same time? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=973.1600000000001s)]
*  They did have Google video [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=976.64s)]
*  Do you know why they bought YouTube? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=977.44s)]
*  No, they bought YouTube because YouTube was growing, you know [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=979.94s)]
*  In order of magnitude faster than Google video and do you know why it was growing faster? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=984.5200000000001s)]
*  No, because Google had too many lawyers [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=991.2s)]
*  YouTube did not so it was like all these legal restrictions on what you could put on Google video and [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=996.12s)]
*  YouTube didn't have that and so in the early days it had really inflationary rapid exponential growth and then once it became dominant [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1002.2s)]
*  You know, you could then start to layer on top, you know user restrictions and so forth [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1010.64s)]
*  But they didn't do that as two guys and two credit cards at the beginning [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1015.1600000000001s)]
*  I mean, you know, this is a story that's so archetypal for almost any net Netflix versus blockbusters [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1018.36s)]
*  Roughly the same reason [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1025.0s)]
*  We had this huge issue at the same that I had a Yahoo with all of this [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1027.52s)]
*  The lawyers would just not let anything disruptive happen. Can I tell a quick story about this? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1032.16s)]
*  Of course [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1036.6000000000001s)]
*  somebody at Yahoo come up came up with an idea when I was running Brickhouse which was [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1037.6000000000001s)]
*  You have this home ad unit in the Yahoo homepage and they said what if we allow [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1041.8s)]
*  Peter to send Salim an ad unit by the ad unit for Salim for his birthday [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1047.52s)]
*  And when I open up Yahoo the ad unit pops up with a message for me saying Salim happy birthday, right? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1053.16s)]
*  We tested it and it was like engagement with the Yahoo homepage went up 50 times [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1059.6s)]
*  I imagine that sure look great idea, right and the lawyers were like absolutely no way because what if somebody put something dodgy or whatever in there [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1064.84s)]
*  Etc etc and we're saying but but they could do that anywhere through any of through send it through email [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1073.44s)]
*  So what do you care? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1078.52s)]
*  And they're like nope can't do it and just literally kill the product that would have delivered 50x better engagement lawyers [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1079.6s)]
*  Okay, I'm gonna go there. All right. Let's go on to our next story here, which is AI generated rom-com trailer [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1086.1599999999999s)]
*  This is this the trail you were talking about [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1093.26s)]
*  This is the track. I have to watch [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1095.36s)]
*  Yeah, this is like really wild [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1098.3999999999999s)]
*  So Claire, what's your stuff the city of lights [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1104.52s)]
*  I'm hoping it's a new start. I don't think we have to pray for long [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1109.6s)]

*  So the top companies in the world are all AI companies, you know, I hit me [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1397.26s)]
*  These companies many of these companies began as software companies [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1401.98s)]
*  then they became [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1405.5s)]
*  Internet companies and then cloud companies and now they're all AI companies [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1408.74s)]

*  It's is opening XO because all of the CEOs in our community are like what the hell do I do? [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1443.2s)]
*  Because either you're diving into the water without knowing where the rocks are [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1448.44s)]
*  Or your company is culturally not ready and there's a huge immune system backlash and people get freaked out [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1452.68s)]

*  And we're doing it at a really low cost just because there's the we have a community of 500 AI experts [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1476.98s)]
*  That's emerged that's operating like a hive mind and every week they get together and discuss kind of like this [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1483.1000000000001s)]

*  So yeah, it's listen AI is much better than us humans at seeing patterns at catching the minutia [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1713.0s)]
*  Always on always paying attention. Yeah [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1719.6399999999999s)]
*  You my favorite example of AI's you know the story of shy's that Danziger and the parole hearings [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1722.3999999999999s)]

*  Yeah, right and it turned out because they're trying to figure out patterns in the data [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1740.24s)]
*  It turned out if you your client your your prisoner came up for parole before lunch and the judges were hungry [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1744.2s)]
*  You're going back to jail if you came up after lunch and they were biologically happier because they'd eaten [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1749.76s)]

*  And and that's when people trained to be impartial [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1759.2s)]
*  Like what hope is there for the rest of you could never have spotted that without an AI type of a pattern and now we [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1761.8s)]
*  Can see these little perturbations and mitigate for all of the cognitive biases that we have around ourselves. Oh amazing. All right [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1767.8799999999999s)]

*  I walked up to a plant and I said hey meta [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1793.92s)]
*  Look at this plant and tell me what it is and it described the plant identified it in details that it grows too [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1797.0s)]
*  But this big it was amazing. Wow, I think this is a huge huge deal. Yeah, you know, it's a [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1803.44s)]

*  I think it's not a general consumer device [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1838.28s)]
*  I think it's gonna be used initially for highly specific industrial applications or like helping it with surgeries [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1840.8s)]
*  Things like that or a specific training [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1847.64s)]

*  Setting it up properly [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1859.68s)]
*  but I think we'll see that type of use case for a couple of years while they figure out how to find the [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1861.44s)]
*  Consumer use case and get the tech down to this [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1866.92s)]
*  I mean look at these these ray bands are like really the the footprint of them the amount of technology in there [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1869.88s)]

*  You know, we're getting to a point where we'll have [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1908.94s)]
*  50 gram head, you know eyewear that's both augmented and virtual reality. So [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1911.54s)]
*  It's not just the four-looking cameras. It's can we display into our eyes our retinas as well and then the world changes [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1917.78s)]
*  and I can't wait and and [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1926.14s)]
*  We're very close because we predicted this a while ago, but we're very very close if not now we're [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1928.5400000000002s)]

*  advertising transform education transform healthcare everything [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1946.7s)]
*  I'll throw out the punchline about AR VR that I've heard from David Roberts is that [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1951.22s)]
*  Virtual reality disrupts reality [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1956.6s)]
*  Because you can do altered like a virtual roller coaster can do way more interesting things than a road roller coaster [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1960.36s)]
*  True that. All right. Here we go AI in government Ukraine unveils AI generated foreign minister spokesperson [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=1965.68s)]

*  directives from the executive branch etc [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2033.6s)]

*  Let's say there may be new threats there. There may be unknown unknowns that we don't [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2175.24s)]
*  realize until too late I [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2181.3199999999997s)]
*  also [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2184.4799999999996s)]
*  Personalized one-on-one persuasion is actually scarier to me not less scary than the mass stuff [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2185.68s)]
*  It's harder to detect it can probably be more powerful and then again an AI can talk to a lot of people at once [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2190.3199999999997s)]
*  So I don't want to give I very much don't want to give a sense that we're not [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2196.4399999999996s)]
*  Worried, but I think it's good that we are worried and that's leading to [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2200.4s)]
*  That's leading to vigilance [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2205.6800000000003s)]
*  In the industry, you know, he said something there about persuasion and [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2208.7200000000003s)]
*  Mogadat and Imad mustak said first thing very similar which is [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2215.2400000000002s)]
*  the power of AI to be persuasive in its language like a [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2220.76s)]
*  You know being able to like take an idea and twist it and and really convince you of it and do it one-on-one [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2225.52s)]
*  For a hundred million people. This is the I think for me one of the big dangers of personalized news when it's tailored to you [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2233.4s)]
*  Now you're at the behest of the algorithm, right? [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2241.96s)]
*  That's why I'd much rather hear a [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2245.84s)]
*  Journalist tell the news and I think that's the biggest danger to me [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2248.88s)]
*  A journalist tell the news and at least I know what their bias is and I can get a sense of it from them [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2253.16s)]
*  It's one hop but the minute I'm interfacing with an AI that's interpreting the news for my ears [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2259.44s)]
*  I lose trust, you know, and this is I think the biggest tough toughest thing for today. I mean I have to say [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2264.7599999999998s)]
*  That I am very much in the mindset of is that real is that real? [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2272.68s)]
*  My my brain is running an algorithm in the back of every time I hear or read something especially see a video [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2278.32s)]
*  I'm asking is that real I saw [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2285.0s)]
*  Elon tweet something out and and he said under the image he says this is a real image, right? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2288.1600000000003s)]
*  And that's interesting where we're gonna have to start to like like say that explicitly, you know [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2294.4s)]
*  We're going from seeing is believing to disrupt distrusting everything [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2300.48s)]
*  We absolutely really really badly need that AI for truth XPRIZE computer [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2304.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, right like we need a filter to help us navigate that a personal agent by the way [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2309.74s)]
*  But there's something else that Sam Alton and said was super important what's that few days, which was that? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2315.2999999999997s)]
*  You're going to have your own personal LLM [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2320.7799999999997s)]
*  That will filter stuff for you and act as your personal almost security guard as to what messages come into you [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2323.8599999999997s)]
*  I thought that was a really powerful way for me. That's important to shape your mindset, right? [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2329.94s)]
*  Our mindsets are shaped. Yeah, what we read what we hear what we see who we hang out with [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2334.1s)]
*  What we ultimately believe right? We're shaping our neural net. And so yeah being able to filter that [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2338.78s)]
*  You know, we talked about echo chambers in Facebook. I [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2345.06s)]
*  Think there is a danger but there's also [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2349.54s)]
*  Somewhat of an important ability to control that [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2353.6600000000003s)]
*  This week was milking global I was there it was [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2357.1s)]
*  incredibly [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2361.54s)]
*  Incredibly crowded. I mean, I have no idea it's like [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2362.8199999999997s)]
*  I've known Mike Milken and I can serve a friend. He spoke this year for me [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2366.66s)]
*  we did a fireside for a few hours at the abundance summit and [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2370.62s)]
*  Milking global is just insane. It's just huge and I think the highlight for the event was Elon on stage [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2375.1s)]
*  I spoke the next morning on longevity, but there are two clips I grabbed from Elon's presentation [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2384.24s)]
*  Just for some conversation. I'm curious about your point of view. Let's play the first one here. I might be the most important [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2391.56s)]
*  questionable [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2398.04s)]
*  The best I mean the percentage of [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2400.64s)]
*  Intelligence that is biological [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2404.0s)]
*  You know grows smaller with each passing month [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2407.2799999999997s)]
*  Eventually the percentage of intelligence that is biological will be less than 1% [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2409.66s)]
*  The [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2417.46s)]
*  That's actually not what I mean, we just I guess don't want AI that is brutal. So [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2418.66s)]
*  That's an important thing for people to realize is that you know, when you think about intelligence [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2424.14s)]
*  In terms of human level intelligence and intellect [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2430.2599999999998s)]
*  It's always been represented by the number of of humans on the planet [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2433.8999999999996s)]
*  And it's just now over the last few decades that we can talk about intelligence [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2438.02s)]
*  I mean, there's animal intelligence for sure, but higher level intelligence now being in compute and [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2442.98s)]
*  biological human intelligence ultimately becoming, you know a de minimis percentage of the [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2450.1400000000003s)]
*  The intelligence in our known universe. Hmm, so I have lots of [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2457.38s)]
*  Issues with this mostly related to my deal trope [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2465.2999999999997s)]
*  I have of how do you define intelligence? Right? We've talked about that before so I won't go into it here [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2468.9s)]
*  But in this case, I do like it because when you have artificial intelligence and you can tailor it our intelligence [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2476.2599999999998s)]
*  Our biological intelligence for four billion years has evolved to do two things survive [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2483.66s)]
*  And now we can free other forms of intelligent from those two things like page rank is evolving a completely orthogonal [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2489.26s)]
*  and and complementary intelligence to humanity, so I think of the intelligence we're growing in machine learning and an AI as [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2496.6600000000003s)]
*  Orthogonal to human intelligence and not replicative it and if you can bring it into [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2505.06s)]
*  Higher realms and have a vibrated higher energy energy [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2511.42s)]
*  Levels like the Hawkins scale then you give it really powerful outcomes like Maslow's hierarchy worked and self actualized [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2514.82s)]
*  And so there's some really wonderful [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2520.82s)]
*  Deep thinking that can be done in some really wonderful philosophical explorations that can be done with this [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2524.6200000000003s)]
*  So I'm finding it really exciting to think about a lot of that. Yeah, I mean I think about it in this way [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2529.82s)]
*  You know throughout the day [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2534.26s)]
*  There's always moments like I wonder what you know, and then I think about it in a lot of ways [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2536.26s)]
*  Moments like I wonder what you know, and then I'll trail off [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2541.34s)]
*  I wonder what would happen if I wonder if this ever occurred and if I happen to have enough time [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2545.46s)]
*  I can sit down and Google it or ask chat GPT [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2552.0200000000004s)]
*  But there's gonna be a time where I can just spin up AI [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2556.34s)]
*  Agents of myself to go and do that work and then report back, right? It's yeah, I mean that's [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2560.86s)]
*  That's extraordinary [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2568.6200000000003s)]
*  You know way back in the 50s Marvin Minsky who's one of Ray Kurzweil's mentors [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2570.9s)]
*  I think you've met more I did back when I was MIT MIT [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2575.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I met him once very briefly [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2579.12s)]
*  But he had a whole thing of having self ideals and then self consciousness then self reflective [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2581.18s)]
*  Then deliberative and reactive or the other way around and in either ideal world you start with a reactive deliberative reflective [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2587.2599999999998s)]
*  The self reflective self-conscious and then self ideals and so he actually created a whole hierarchy of increasing sophistication of [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2594.68s)]
*  Intelligence which I think is gonna be amazing to watch evolve and then come into being and I also take the positive view that [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2603.2s)]
*  A very evolved AI is is is thousand times less likely to do harm to us than not [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2609.58s)]
*  You know, I just recorded a podcast this past few days with Guillaume Verdun [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2616.28s)]
*  The founder of the acceleration is movement [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2623.1s)]
*  Jesus that's Jesus. Yes, and he was making the important point that we need [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2625.46s)]
*  massive [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2631.7400000000002s)]
*  diversity in our AI and and one of the things that [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2632.98s)]
*  Elon just hit at the very end of that comment was making sure it's not brittle and [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2637.9s)]
*  One of the things that biology does is it creates massive diversity so that if there's ever a massive impact on the [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2642.7400000000002s)]
*  Planet or in the environment [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2651.2200000000003s)]
*  Yes, it will kill a lot of people or if a new virus comes in or a new poison gets exposed but [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2653.1s)]
*  through evolutionary diversity there will be [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2660.5s)]
*  Something that survives and then dominates [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2664.3s)]
*  right, so we need the same thing in in some way I think he's saying in the AI space to I [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2666.9s)]
*  Just had a little fork that please just me super excited Peter [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2673.1s)]
*  Which is you know given if you take alpha full say right and the ability for to model that [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2677.26s)]
*  Things you could essentially apply that to a species thing and say go create a million new species [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2682.82s)]
*  Yes, I mean you could you could like this so you could actually repopulate or [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2689.54s)]
*  Increase that resilience and say we want to have 10x more species because we see feel like the insects are dying out go [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2695.3s)]
*  Freaking repopulate a bunch, you know that might be a really well [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2701.26s)]
*  Yes, and I mean God knows what you'll end up [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2705.46s)]
*  But that's the same with evolution right remember when they found discover the duck bill platypus they literally thought it was fake [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2709.26s)]
*  But you know, it's interesting I think about the you know today we're building humanoid robots out of [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2716.7400000000002s)]
*  Motors and metals and sensors. I think ultimately we're gonna build robots biologically [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2722.9s)]
*  You know you want something at a carpet cleaner [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2730.6200000000003s)]
*  You're gonna design a [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2733.38s)]
*  Biological robot that eats lint and peas stain remover, right and that will be and I often thought, you know [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2736.34s)]
*  listen, I don't want to get into the into the the [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2743.6200000000003s)]
*  black hole pit of UFOs, but I've often thought that you know [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2746.9s)]
*  These aliens that different societies speak about consistently the grays whatever and I know nothing about this stuff [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2752.94s)]
*  In my mind, I think they're probably biological robots that were sent here to explore I mean you're not [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2760.4599999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I always look at it from just for the sake of argument look at it from rather than we're building robots with machinery [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2768.9399999999996s)]
*  There's no difference between us and us and a robot is just the we're operating off wetware [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2776.7s)]
*  Every emotion in our brain is just a sub sub routine. Yeah, and we are we're [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2782.2599999999998s)]
*  Micro machines were molecular machines, right and when Eric that's right Eric Drexler wrote engines of creation [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2787.78s)]
*  you know, he talked about nanotechnology is where we're gonna end up and these will be just more efficient versions of biological machines which [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2794.5s)]
*  you know entropy and [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2803.7400000000002s)]
*  Thermodynamics ended up creating us but not yeah putting aside religion not without an intelligent system [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2806.54s)]
*  Optimizing it so yeah just as an example just as example [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2814.58s)]
*  It turns out that a photosynthesis that plants use to convert sunlight into sugar is a really really inefficient process. Mm-hmm [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2818.42s)]
*  It's like you could make a 20x better as an article I read somewhere [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2827.54s)]
*  So if you could make it 10x better, oh my god [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2831.2999999999997s)]
*  It would smoothly change our energy harvesting capabilities for plants animals and all species so you could actually go apply AI to all these [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2833.58s)]
*  Microbiological functions radically change them. It's gonna be a fun a few decades ahead [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2841.14s)]
*  All right, let's check out Elon's opinion. So this is the basis upon which he is building his AI company [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2848.14s)]
*  Xai let's listen up to to Elon here. I think an AI would be [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2855.2599999999998s)]
*  as those truth-seeking maximally curious would foster [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2859.82s)]
*  Human civilization to see where where it goes [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2864.06s)]
*  So the basis there and he said the same thing at at the abundance summit is [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2867.9s)]
*  If you you know, if you're trying to like how do you optimize? [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2872.18s)]
*  an AI what are what are its [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2876.7799999999997s)]
*  You know its focused [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2881.2999999999997s)]
*  Parameters, it's trying to maximize and and for him. It's maximally curious got that [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2883.8199999999997s)]
*  That's probably good. Especially if you're finding if curiosity gives you some [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2889.54s)]
*  Level of truth and maximally truth-seeking [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2895.7000000000003s)]
*  You know and what he said is do not force your AIs to lie [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2899.46s)]
*  Which is what Gemini did and it sort of like woke a Gemini version in the early days [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2903.46s)]
*  I [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2909.46s)]
*  Mean, it's I think about this a lot. What what's your [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2910.98s)]
*  What's your optimization function in your AI? [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2915.46s)]
*  What are you trying to do? [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2918.7000000000003s)]
*  I think these are pretty good. What do you think? I think these are very good [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2920.7000000000003s)]
*  I I have a bias about human civilization [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2924.7000000000003s)]
*  Because as my dad said we've not civilized the world we've materialized the world [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2930.42s)]
*  We still have to do the job to civilize it [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2934.6600000000003s)]
*  So I think because we're we're still deeply wired to operate as tribal mecca tribal beings, right? [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2937.1400000000003s)]
*  Us versus them except for etc. So we have to use AI to mitigate against those [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2944.54s)]
*  Deep-seated biological bias by the way, I think I think that's the only way so we all have these cognitive biases [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2949.94s)]
*  Right and people should be aware of this, right? [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2957.02s)]
*  You have a recency bias you give more weight to something that you recently heard over something you heard a year ago [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2959.34s)]
*  You have a negativity bias you give more weight to negative information filmy [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2965.14s)]
*  I read from the arity bias you give you know wait to some cost bias [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2968.94s)]
*  We have all of these and you will be able to turn on your version of Jarvis my favorite AI [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2972.3s)]
*  And say listen, I want you to make me aware when I'm being biased and I want you to get a countervailing [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2979.68s)]
*  Information, I think that's gonna be an or at least identify the biases that I'm coming with. Yes [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2987.48s)]
*  Yeah for looking at some piece of content or understanding something or making a judgment call [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2992.68s)]
*  What by this is where I think AI's and in the boardroom will be really really useful [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=2998.38s)]
*  Because an AI will be able to go I'm sorry [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3003.08s)]
*  They're operating out of total profit-seeking values even even if it's not [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3005.08s)]
*  You know politically acceptable because that political acceptability just could destroy us [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3009.7599999999998s)]
*  So here's another Google announces med AI models for health care [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3014.44s)]
*  And I think you know, we're seeing Apple and Amazon and Google [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3019.4s)]
*  I mean, there's nothing more valuable than a person's health [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3025.52s)]
*  And so I just had a chance to to speak with Karen DeSalvo who's the head of Google Health [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3028.0s)]
*  amazing MD [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3033.24s)]
*  And yeah [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3034.76s)]
*  Google's gonna help you it will ultimately be your best [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3036.6800000000003s)]
*  Diagnostician it'll ultimately be your best surgeon as well. I am super excited by this [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3041.0400000000004s)]
*  Especially in say emerging markets where they have a doctor per million citizens type of thing. You can now have a [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3046.1200000000003s)]
*  very viable [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3053.44s)]
*  Medical help and medical care diagnostics etc across the board at near zero cost [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3055.36s)]
*  This is what Imad was trying to get to [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3060.96s)]
*  When he was [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3063.56s)]
*  As when he talked about it at the abundance summit and others [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3064.76s)]
*  I think that is going to be an uplifter for humanity that on the way that we've never seen [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3067.6s)]
*  Did you see the movie Oppenheimer if you did? [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3072.8s)]
*  Did you know that besides building the atomic bomb at Los Alamos National Labs that they spent billions on? [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3076.32s)]
*  biodefense weapons the ability to accurately detect viruses and microbes by reading their RNA well a company called Viome [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3084.56s)]
*  exclusively licensed the technology from Los Alamos Labs to build a platform that can measure your [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3092.54s)]
*  microbiome and the RNA in your blood now Viome has a product that I've personally used for years called full body intelligence [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3099.42s)]
*  Which collects a few drops of your blood spit and stool and can tell you so much about your health [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3105.9s)]
*  They've tested over 700,000 individuals and use their AI models to deliver members critical health guidance [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3111.06s)]
*  Like what foods you should eat what foods you shouldn't eat as well as your supplements and probiotics [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3117.66s)]
*  Your biological age and other deep health insights and the results of the recommendations are nothing short of stellar [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3122.98s)]
*  you know as reported in the American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine after just six months of following biomes recommendations members reported the following a [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3130.12s)]
*  36% reduction in depression a [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3139.22s)]
*  40% reduction in anxiety a [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3142.18s)]
*  30% reduction in diabetes and a 48% reduction in IBS listen I've been using Viome for three years [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3144.7s)]
*  I know that my oral and gut health is one of my highest priorities [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3151.4199999999996s)]
*  Best of all Viome is affordable which is part of my mission to democratize health if you want to join me on this journey [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3156.58s)]
*  Go to Viome comm slash Peter. I've asked Naveen Jain a friend of mine [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3163.58s)]
*  Who's the founder and CEO of Viome to give my listeners a special discount? [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3167.8199999999997s)]
*  You'll find it at Viome comm slash Peter [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3171.54s)]
*  We are having a lot of AI news what comes along with it now is robotic news [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3175.46s)]
*  This is fun [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3181.38s)]
*  So we're gonna start to see [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3183.06s)]
*  Tesla's optimus being used in the factory [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3185.54s)]
*  I think you know Tesla, you know Elon's had a tough month on Tesla and he said we have two [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3188.62s)]
*  Important breakthroughs that are gonna be driving sales one is optimus and one's a robot axis. We'll talk that in a minute [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3195.06s)]
*  But you know if you can bring the cost of labor down a lot of the a lot of the things that we buy [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3201.58s)]
*  It's labor materials cost is important, but labor is still up there. I'm not gonna run the robot [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3208.22s)]
*  But here we see optimus, you know checking out these lithium-ion battery cells to make sure [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3214.22s)]
*  Yeah, can I give a bit of framing on yeah, of course [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3219.38s)]
*  This you know one of the things that really blew our minds a few years ago when we first saw the Baxter robot [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3222.54s)]
*  I remember Baxter [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3228.12s)]
*  Yeah, right and what what what I found unbelievably fascinating about it [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3229.4s)]
*  Was that throughout the history of robotics because we've had robots and factory floors forever [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3234.16s)]
*  You had to program the robot explicitly and you had to say pick up a widget turn 90 degrees move over here turn back put [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3238.96s)]
*  It down rotate it to fit it in a slot [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3245.2s)]
*  And you had to list that and explain program it in that way which took forever [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3248.04s)]
*  But with Baxter and all of these humanoid robots [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3252.08s)]
*  You can literally show it what to do and it literally learns off the off the movements you showed and then [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3254.56s)]
*  Replicates it and optimize from there so you don't have to program a robot anymore [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3260.68s)]
*  Which is a huge breakthrough and allows you to now expand in all these use cases in really really powerful ways [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3265.32s)]
*  so I think there's an unbelievable explosion of use cases coming and the what we've been waiting for is the cost of all of the [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3271.68s)]
*  servo motors and [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3277.84s)]
*  Movements of structures accepted a drop because the original Baxter robot the arms cost $10,000 each [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3279.24s)]
*  Yeah, right and now that's dropping 50% a year and now it's down to I think it's about a thousand dollars an arm [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3285.7599999999998s)]
*  Today and just gonna keep going down. So that's really really exciting. Yeah [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3291.6s)]
*  All right, so let's move on beyond optimist here. I found this absolutely fascinating [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3295.9599999999996s)]
*  So and the title reads here Nvidia announces dr. Eureka robot training LLM [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3301.9199999999996s)]
*  So I mentioned earlier that being able to simulate something [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3307.4s)]
*  Is why they really work in real life? And so Nvidia? [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3311.1600000000003s)]
*  Announced in a large language model agent that automates writing code to train robot skills [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3316.6800000000003s)]
*  So they so here we got we have a robot dog that's going to be trained to balance on a yoga ball [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3322.8s)]
*  Purely in simulation and then they actually it transfers and what's called a zero shot to the real world, which means [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3331.1s)]
*  Here's the here's the robot dog on the yoga ball [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3338.98s)]
*  And the first time it's tried in the real world after being learned in simulation. It works perfectly. That's [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3343.58s)]
*  amazing [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3351.06s)]
*  amazing [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3352.7799999999997s)]
*  Incredible. Um, can I give you my other favorite story around? Yeah, please [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3354.62s)]
*  Do you know the story of Ross Chastain the NASCAR driver? No [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3360.22s)]
*  Okay, so about 18 months ago [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3364.1s)]
*  and I'll we can find the clip and stick it in by the way a [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3366.46s)]
*  NASCAR driver called Ross Chastain was on the final lap of a race [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3370.42s)]
*  he's seventh place and his team tells him you have to jump four spots to qualify for the championships and [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3373.52s)]
*  What he did was he [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3379.7s)]
*  Had one shot at this [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3382.7799999999997s)]
*  Because in normal racing you can't pass four cars in one lap. It's impossible [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3384.74s)]
*  What he did was he floored put the car into fifth gear and floored it and he went around and he used the wall [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3389.1s)]
*  To keep himself in [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3395.22s)]
*  From hugging the wall. He used the wall to keep himself on the track and scrape the wall [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3397.54s)]
*  at one point he was going 70 miles an hour faster than the other cars and [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3401.98s)]
*  Wished around the wall catapulted himself and came in the fourth place and qualified Wow [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3407.1s)]
*  Change again everybody's mind. He too big change the game [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3412.7s)]
*  It had never been done in the history of racing was incredible about it. He practiced this on a GameCube [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3415.86s)]
*  Of course, he may live he practiced it on the simulator and the frickin did it in real life [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3422.82s)]
*  Unbelievable. They of course changed the rules after that because it was too dangerous [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3427.94s)]
*  I thought you're gonna tell me they put little wheels on the side of his car [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3432.1800000000003s)]
*  Well, if one little stud was sticking out of that wall, you'd have been toast [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3435.3s)]
*  Yeah, right, but but he did it and it actually worked and it's just such an incredible example of [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3438.58s)]
*  Applying technology and and making a breakthrough that nobody ever thought was possible [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3444.46s)]
*  You know really powerful with thinking and coloring outside the lines. All right. Here's a mass humanoid production in China by 2025 [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3449.66s)]
*  China is also developing a humanoid robot industry [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3459.98s)]
*  Look at that the loss of year is coming true [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3466.22s)]
*  Alex goo is the founder and CEO of Fourier Intelligence [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3469.26s)]
*  Last year, he launched the gr1 his first generation humanoid [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3474.6600000000003s)]
*  We can do so a couple of comments one. I still think optimus is the best-looking robot and [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3481.6200000000003s)]
*  to [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3489.7400000000002s)]
*  Amazing right China needs this to maintain its economy in a big way [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3492.02s)]
*  Yes [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3496.94s)]
*  The birth rate and the huge population [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3497.9s)]
*  Implosion they're going to have [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3501.86s)]
*  Same with Japan. They need robots to actually do all the work and they don't have a choice [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3503.78s)]
*  So they have to automate and create robots at scale in a way that we've never seen [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3508.58s)]
*  I think this is gonna be super exciting [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3513.42s)]
*  I'm kind of you know, you've been really really enthusiastic about this for a while and I'm slowly grudgingly getting there. Yeah [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3516.1400000000003s)]
*  Why is it grudgingly why why use case why you know just because I'm like I don't understand my big beef is why the [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3523.5400000000004s)]
*  Humanoid it's such the human being is such because our world our world is designed around humanoid us [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3529.7400000000002s)]
*  I mean, it's like this thing is the size that my hand can grip, you know, we have to redesign the rest of our world [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3536.0600000000004s)]
*  It's you do remember [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3541.7400000000002s)]
*  What was that little device that predated the Palm pilot remember the Palm pilot? [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3543.98s)]
*  Of course, okay, so the Palm pilot was interesting [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3549.28s)]
*  They they were trying to get the software to adapt [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3553.6000000000004s)]
*  to your writing style [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3559.1200000000003s)]
*  And then they made a decision [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3561.84s)]
*  No, we're gonna actually teach the human to adapt to Palm pilots writing style and they created some kind of a script [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3563.52s)]
*  Right a T was I go that's this way in this way. And so it's it rather than building, you know [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3571.1600000000003s)]
*  Rather than changing the built world [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3577.8s)]
*  To adopt for the robots have the robots adapt to the built world, you know elevators escalators [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3580.56s)]
*  stairs chairs [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3588.0s)]
*  all those things I [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3589.64s)]
*  Mean it makes perfect sense to me and they're much cooler [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3591.56s)]
*  Come on. It's good. Come on [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3595.68s)]
*  Okay, but hold it let me push back on that. So if I'm wanting to mow a lawn, yeah [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3598.04s)]
*  I don't want a human robot. I want a robot lawnmower that has wheel [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3603.16s)]
*  But don't you want no no no no, I want the same robot that can clean the dishes and can mow the lawn and can fold the [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3606.4s)]
*  The laundry and can clean the kids room, you know and it can go shopping for me [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3614.44s)]
*  I don't want to pay for that and teach every one of these and pay for all the different hardware [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3620.44s)]
*  You know, I want it. That's it [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3626.36s)]
*  Okay, so so you you're gonna we're gonna end up with a robot that looks the end of its arms are gonna look like a robot [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3629.12s)]
*  With like a vacuum cleaner with 60. No, it picks up the robot picks up the vacuum. I currently own and vacuums the room. Oh [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3636.2s)]
*  My god, okay [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3644.0s)]
*  Yeah, there you there. I'm you disagree [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3646.04s)]
*  I I think that I think that gets too hard to do for many many many use cases [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3648.44s)]
*  Mmm, but I'll give you my counterpoint [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3653.92s)]
*  I think what will happen is let's say I want that human robot to go mow the lawn [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3656.3599999999997s)]
*  It'll put up its its connector thing which has a spinning blade and it'll go around [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3660.64s)]
*  Mowing the lawn perhaps pretty quickly and you don't care worried too much about but I think there's a hidden dirty little secret in all [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3665.72s)]
*  Of these human robots etc, which is power and we saw this at the abundant summit [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3672.8399999999997s)]
*  The battery life is still really really poor on these things. They last like an hour to an hour and a half [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3678.4s)]
*  But again, that's gonna that's growing exponentially. So nuclear power plants a few iterations of micro nuclear micro nukes [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3683.56s)]
*  Be [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3691.16s)]
*  Being but but I but I do take your plan. I think it's gonna be super exciting and I'm coming I'm [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3693.52s)]
*  Tilting more and more to your better. The prediction is a billion robots in like a decade's time [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3699.52s)]
*  Right, but no cost laws like, you know, we're gonna exceed and Elon's like 10 billion robots [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3705.12s)]
*  Well, I mean that's what he would say Jimmy cars there are on the planet. I [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3709.04s)]
*  Was so I was shocked by this. There's like just under a billion cars. I [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3713.64s)]
*  Would I would have thought there were more and [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3718.6000000000004s)]
*  So the prediction is more humanoid robots than cars by by orders magnitude [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3721.2000000000003s)]
*  Okay. Okay. I'll give you my counterpoint. Yeah, I remember I've e reckoned thought used to say [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3727.44s)]
*  You'll have multiple 3d printers in in your house running each way. He never said that I [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3733.32s)]
*  remember that [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3739.0800000000004s)]
*  But there was certainly a meme in the industry saying every room will have a [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3743.4s)]
*  3d printer robot a 3d printer and we didn't kind of see that so I [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3747.8s)]
*  Instead of millions of robots, I why can't we have one humanoid robot? [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3753.28s)]
*  That does a lot of things and you share in you within your neighborhood and they that one thing [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3757.28s)]
*  I think it's gonna be I think you'll see it listen the Elon's prediction and God knows [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3762.5600000000004s)]
*  He is the most precise and all predictions known in the universe, right? [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3766.7000000000003s)]
*  But let's just say I'm and you know, I'm an investor in figure [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3770.1600000000003s)]
*  And visit Brad adcock at figure [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3774.48s)]
*  in a couple weeks [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3778.7200000000003s)]
*  Okay, and the number there is somewhere between 40,000 and 100,000 per robot [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3780.96s)]
*  Okay, so if they have the same kind of lifetime as a car and you can lease them [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3787.6s)]
*  We're talking about 400 to a thousand dollars a month for a humanoid robot [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3794.0s)]
*  You know that's pretty affordable for something that can do all of your tasks all the time [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3799.1600000000003s)]
*  24-7 on demand and yeah, I might lend it to you, but I may just want to have it there when I want it [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3805.88s)]
*  anyway, we'll see I [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3812.5600000000004s)]
*  Okay, I'll give you my [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3814.6000000000004s)]
*  Kind of huge [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3818.32s)]
*  Flag to go off in my head and then okay, we can move on. Okay, go for it [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3820.1600000000003s)]
*  The [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3823.6s)]
*  I don't agree that I do hear you. All right. So last last slide on the robot side is is Tesla robot taxi [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3853.72s)]
*  pretty cool looking vehicle [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3861.92s)]
*  so this [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3864.56s)]
*  Elan's announced on August 8th. He's announcing the Tesla robot taxi [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3867.12s)]
*  and [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3873.16s)]
*  He went to China [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3874.64s)]
*  He sort of like skipped India went straight to China with the objective of a robot taxi in China [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3875.8399999999997s)]
*  And this is rumored to be $25,000 [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3881.52s)]
*  This is if if and when he gets this right, this is the biggest financial play that [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3884.4s)]
*  That Tesla has ever done. It's the massive market [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3891.0s)]
*  Massive market. Have you have you driven? Have you driven on one of the any any of the way Mo's or anything yet? [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3895.48s)]
*  Yes, I've been in an autonomous taxi in Phoenix and [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3901.28s)]
*  They're [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3905.64s)]
*  Clunky and a little slow, but they work perfectly well, especially in a very predictable grid format [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3906.7599999999998s)]
*  for this particular announcement, I'm usually a little suspicious of some of Elon's announcements because of the [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3912.52s)]
*  The PR aspect of it, but this one I'm very very very excited about I think this brings to fruition [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3919.24s)]
*  the potential of Tesla in [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3926.68s)]
*  Completely changing the game for transportation. I'm unbelievably excited about this [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3929.92s)]
*  You know, I agreed I mean [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3934.12s)]
*  For god's sakes. Can I put my kid in a taxi and a robot taxi and let it drive him to school? Yeah, I [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3936.92s)]
*  mean, it's ridiculous I [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3943.64s)]
*  Find this as [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3947.12s)]
*  The question is how fast is this transition gonna occur right if you look back 120 years ago at the transition [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3950.7999999999997s)]
*  From cars from horses to cars it took like 10 years and then it was like it was very fast done [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3958.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3964.96s)]
*  So we're gonna stop way Mo has been really slow in coming right? I mean, yeah, and and what's interesting is that [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3966.64s)]
*  Robo tag Tesla vehicles are at least unless he's changed his name of his game are all [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3975.8799999999997s)]
*  Camera based there's no lidar [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3982.72s)]
*  Right, there's no ultrasound it's all imaging base [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3984.7999999999997s)]
*  So I know I use I use autopilot [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3989.04s)]
*  all the time on my car and [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3992.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it will have FSD. I have full self-driving. Yeah, and I use it [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=3994.8399999999997s)]
*  90% of the time it's only tried to kill me like once maybe twice and I [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4000.2799999999997s)]
*  Probably jumped the gun. It's like is it making a right turn here like into into those cones over there? [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4006.48s)]
*  Does it see them and I can't take the risk that it does it probably would have yeah, but [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4013.08s)]
*  But it would take me, you know [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4019.32s)]
*  The only problem is when I'm using full self-driving [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4021.04s)]
*  Your your your hands have to be on the wheel and it's feeling the resistance you're putting on it [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4024.04s)]
*  And so a lot of times it's like my hands on the wheel [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4029.0s)]
*  But it's not tight enough and not a resistance and then it starts blinking red and says full self-driving is off [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4032.4s)]
*  You know, you've been a bad boy. You've had your hands off the wheel [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4038.52s)]
*  So I can't wait for it to actually [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4041.4s)]
*  Be there all the time so I can like make you so time [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4043.84s)]
*  I think I think so the next step under the robot axis is I think one level when I can [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4047.32s)]
*  Take my existing Tesla. Yeah [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4053.52s)]
*  The fleet when I'm on a two-day business trip. Yeah, that's when I think the the [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4055.52s)]
*  Next inflection point really. Yeah, definitely [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4060.8s)]
*  I want to be able to say push the button on the screen that says go earn me some money and then yeah [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4062.8s)]
*  I'll happily split the revenue 50-50 with Elon or whatever it is. Yeah [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4068.48s)]
*  All right, let's go. Let's [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4072.84s)]
*  Let's close out on Bitcoin news exciting couple of weeks here [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4075.84s)]
*  And you've been on so many stages with and without me saying buy Bitcoin buy Bitcoin now [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4080.08s)]
*  I [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4088.64s)]
*  Have you have I am very I'm very very excited about this [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4090.0s)]
*  This is one where MicroStrategy [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4094.08s)]
*  This is one where MicroStrategy Michael Saylor [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4096.08s)]
*  announced a decentralized ID protocol [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4099.76s)]
*  Using ordinals our ordinals are like NFTs for the Bitcoin world [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4103.28s)]
*  Non-fungible tokens and [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4109.36s)]
*  This is pretty exciting. I think it'll come down to whether it's truly self-sovereign [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4111.72s)]
*  I haven't looked into the orange protocol closely enough to see if it's actually self-sovereign ID, but I think it's a really great play [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4117.68s)]
*  I think he's got a great shot at doing it and [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4123.84s)]
*  The potential here. So can I do a little so let's go through a couple others [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4126.88s)]
*  So I want to make a couple of comments about Bitcoin and and and crypto in general. Okay [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4132.0s)]
*  Let's go here. So, you know, I think the big news has been the having it happened [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4137.2s)]
*  It happened and and I'm like [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4144.400000000001s)]
*  I'm like, okay time to go [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4147.16s)]
*  Let's you know, let's get that price going and there are all these memes of people expecting rocket ship ending up with a [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4150.22s)]
*  dripping off [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4157.78s)]
*  So what happened that this was expected it was I'm [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4161.82s)]
*  Yeah, we when you look at the price charts and you do technique and analysis you when you have a huge run-up like that [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4166.22s)]
*  It's gonna consolidate for a little while. The only [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4172.86s)]
*  Thing is how long will it consolidate for before it goes to the next level? [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4176.5s)]
*  The the word that I'm hearing is if it drops below 57 [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4181.86s)]
*  Then it's gonna go to the another technical level below and it'll stay sideways for much longer [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4185.82s)]
*  If it stays about 57, this is a temporary period and then it's gonna start shooting up again [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4192.26s)]
*  I did a podcast this morning with Jeff Booth [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4196.98s)]
*  Okay, who I think of as the chief economist of the of the crypto world [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4199.78s)]
*  And I asked him what he thought the what the percentage likelihood we'd hit a million dollars of Bitcoin and [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4204.54s)]
*  What he thought the ultimate value would be [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4212.26s)]
*  And he said I've said in the past I'm 99% sure but I'm now 100% sure it hits a million dollars a bit when [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4215.14s)]
*  When is the difficult problem question because when is this [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4224.42s)]
*  Last he death he death of the universe. So come on [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4227.860000000001s)]
*  He refuses to he refused to put timing for various and obvious reasons [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4231.62s)]
*  Although I tried to pin hard to pin him down [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4236.860000000001s)]
*  But he made a more dramatic comment that I've heard before which is the world has about 900 trillion in assets. Yeah [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4238.700000000001s)]
*  globally and [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4246.46s)]
*  His view is that Bitcoin will become that 900 trillion divided by 21 million in that division [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4248.1s)]
*  42 million a Bitcoin [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4256.3s)]
*  He is now of the opinion that we will over time inevitably move to Bitcoin as a [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4259.820000000001s)]
*  not just a [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4266.9400000000005s)]
*  Store value like digital gold but a unit of account and you'll be measuring your house not in how many [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4268.26s)]
*  Dollars is worth but how many Bitcoin is worth again. Yes came over listen. I [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4274.780000000001s)]
*  Talk a lot about longevity. I talk about adding 50 years of life or a hundred years of life [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4279.9800000000005s)]
*  I just need to understand is this like, you know, can you give me a decade? [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4284.82s)]
*  So, can I give you my personal sure I [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4292.58s)]
*  Think Bitcoin hits a million dollars of Bitcoin in the next [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4296.099999999999s)]
*  Three to four years why because the debt bomb is now hitting this year [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4299.7s)]
*  The US will spend more servicing its debt than it does on the military. Yeah [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4306.099999999999s)]
*  That's a massive massive number that's the highest expense item on the US [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4312.1s)]
*  Annual payroll annual bill and now the interest on the debt that they've incurred is now the highest biggest expense [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4319.38s)]
*  And it's growing exponentially by the way. Yes, I don't want to use I don't like using that example of exponential growth [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4327.14s)]
*  All right, let's close out. Let's close out with this subject and this video. Let me hit play here [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4333.62s)]
*  Yeah, and then you talk to me about it [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4338.82s)]
*  Lost 30 million dollars in crypto top. How did you fall for that? I mean even Gronk was like me [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4341.38s)]
*  No that not real money like [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4346.86s)]
*  So so this one viral yeah completely viral as kind of a joke on on Tom Brady at his roast [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4357.34s)]
*  I think the bigger implication here is [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4364.9400000000005s)]
*  Why did he lose so much money right and when this speaks to the FTX collapse now [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4368.14s)]
*  I want to talk about this for me. All right, so when you have digital currencies and cryptocurrencies, etc [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4372.94s)]
*  There's three points on the triangle you want to hit [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4377.7s)]
*  Decentralization security and scalability [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4380.9s)]
*  Okay, and it's also to ties back to what Jeff Booth is why he's so excited about Bitcoin these days when Bitcoin first came out [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4383.099999999999s)]
*  He did decentralization and security for the first time ever in a digital currency [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4390.74s)]
*  Never had that before people got super excited by it [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4394.86s)]
*  But it did not solve for the scalability part because Bitcoin initially was not that scalable [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4397.94s)]
*  Hence all the altcoins Ethereum Solana Cardano data data all trying to solve for scalability in different use cases as they saw it [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4402.86s)]
*  consumer-grade [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4412.0199999999995s)]
*  Microtransactions, etc. But in doing she trying to achieve scalability [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4413.46s)]
*  Compromised on decentralization or the compromised on security. Hence the FTX collapse because it wasn't decentralized [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4418.139999999999s)]
*  and hence Luna, etc, etc, so [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4424.9s)]
*  FTX looked really good for a while, but because they underline architecture is flawed Tom Brady lost a lot of money on it [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4428.46s)]
*  It's not a commentary on crypto in general. It's the fact that the scalable altcoins were flawed in [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4434.599999999999s)]
*  Decentralization or flawed in security [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4442.099999999999s)]
*  In the last couple years they've developed the lightning network on Bitcoin [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4444.46s)]
*  Which actually makes Bitcoin scalable and now there's an explosion of engineering [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4448.82s)]
*  If you think about scalability, that's an engineering problem not an invention problem, right? [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4452.82s)]
*  And so now there's all these efforts to create layer twos on Bitcoin [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4457.38s)]
*  Lightning is one of them that looks pretty robust and now we can make Bitcoin truly scalable [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4462.139999999999s)]
*  It's all three and therefore the like the super smart folks that we know are going all in on Bitcoin [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4467.099999999999s)]
*  So that's part of the rationale there. What's your ratio of owned Bitcoin to Ethereum to Solana or to anything else right now? [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4474.2s)]
*  Yeah [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4482.34s)]
*  I'm in the I used to be about [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4483.54s)]
*  50-50 I'm now in the 85 to 90 percent Bitcoin [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4488.22s)]
*  Yeah, I'm I'm the same [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4492.42s)]
*  Wait, and I've gone deep in ordinals ordinals. There's like a baseball team on [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4494.900000000001s)]
*  That's the Cardinals [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4502.14s)]
*  Orioles NFTs or ordinals or NFTs on Bitcoin [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4504.18s)]
*  So, you know we as an opening XO community been waiting for a while to launch an NFT project because with a community you really want [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4508.0599999999995s)]
*  something like that and [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4515.0199999999995s)]
*  How do we reward the XO heroes? So we we actually have just announced and I've minted a [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4516.78s)]
*  collection called XO heroes [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4524.299999999999s)]
*  which are a [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4526.62s)]
*  Collection of ordinals and we'll go across multiple chains of this [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4528.66s)]
*  for people that are building the new web3 [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4532.9s)]
*  Realities that will replace the old world and so that collection is going live over the next [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4536.860000000001s)]
*  Few weeks and we'll be allowing people to mint XO heroes for free [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4542.14s)]
*  if they have recruits and other things but they can go to [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4547.1s)]
*  XO heroes comm and check it out or track us at XO heroes NFT on Twitter [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4550.9800000000005s)]
*  I think and then I'm in the general we finally jumped into that mode modality. Great. How big is the XO community again? [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4555.72s)]
*  Salim we're now thirty seven thousand people in a hundred and fifty countries amazing and how does someone do I mean you offer tools and [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4562.66s)]
*  Transformation tool kits and how to build an EXO [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4570.740000000001s)]
*  We do master classes training networking, etc, etc. Awesome. Awesome. So check check it out at open exo comm [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4574.26s)]
*  and [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4582.42s)]
*  Salim, what's your what's your handle on on X? [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4583.62s)]
*  My Twitter handle is Salim Ismail [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4587.34s)]
*  Which has been a bit of a nightmare recently because the podcast I did with Tom Bilyeu just dropped [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4589.62s)]
*  So I'm getting some weird mentions and a couple of weeks ago [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4594.74s)]
*  Remember you and I did a clip [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4598.0199999999995s)]
*  One of your moonshot episodes and there was a two-minute clip of me talking about the fact that you cannot regulate AI at all [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4599.74s)]
*  And Elon retweeted that clip [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4606.38s)]
*  And weird things happen when Elon retweets your face. Yes [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4609.38s)]
*  Did you get marriage proposals or what happened no [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4613.22s)]
*  No, like just some really like who the hell you pal [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4617.900000000001s)]
*  It was very surreal [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4623.9400000000005s)]
*  But it's a really important point. We made that point. I'm gonna make it again [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4625.9400000000005s)]
*  We'd see no mechanism by which you can regulate AI like at all [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4630.18s)]
*  You'd have to go down and regulate it at every line of code being written [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4634.62s)]
*  Which is obviously non or or invent a time machine one or the other whichever is easier [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4638.06s)]
*  No, I think so we've partnered with the Casper blockchain, which is doing a really amazing job [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4643.22s)]
*  They're what they're doing is they're creating a blockchain based audit function where you can run your AI [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4649.12s)]
*  through an audit analysis and it'll analyze the the [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4653.820000000001s)]
*  The the depth of the model and the elegance of the model and so on [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4659.18s)]
*  So there's a really interesting vector there on that. Oh amazing everybody [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4663.7s)]
*  Thank you for listening to this episode of moonshots [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZPE61yqfW8&t=4668.26s)]
